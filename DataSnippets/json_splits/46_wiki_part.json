This system of equations first appeared in the work of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] {{harv|d'Alembert|1752}}. Later, [[Leonhard Euler]] connected this system to the [[analytic functions]] {{harv|Euler|1797}}. {{harvtxt|Cauchy|1814}} then used these equations to construct his theory of functions. Riemann's dissertation {{harv|Riemann|1851}} on the theory of functions appeared in 1851.\n\nThe Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations on a pair of real-valued functions of two real variables ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') are the two equations:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n(1a)\\qquad & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\\\[6pt]\n(1b)\\qquad & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTypically ''u'' and ''v'' are taken to be the [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s respectively of a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function of a single complex variable {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'' + i''y'') = ''u''(''x'',''y'') + i''v''(''x'',''y'')}}.  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' are real-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a point in an [[open subset]] of '''C ''' ('''C''' is the set of complex numbers), which can be considered as functions from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''.  This implies that the partial derivatives of ''u'' and ''v'' exist (although they need not be continuous) and we can approximate small variations of ''f'' linearly. Then {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''u'' + i''v''}} is complex-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at that point if and only if the partial derivatives of ''u'' and ''v'' satisfy the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations (1a) and (1b) at that point. The sole existence of partial derivatives satisfying the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations is not enough to ensure complex differentiability at that point. It is necessary that u and v be real differentiable, which is a stronger condition than the existence of the partial derivatives, but in general, weaker than continuous differentiability.\n\n[[Holomorphic function|Holomorphy]] is the property of a complex function of being differentiable at every point of an open and connected subset of '''C''' (this is called a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in '''C'''). Consequently, we can assert that a complex function ''f'', whose real and imaginary parts ''u'' and ''v'' are real-differentiable functions, is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if and only if, equations (1a) and (1b) are satisfied throughout the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] we are dealing with.  [[Holomorphic functions are analytic]] and vice versa. This means that, in complex analysis, a function that is complex-differentiable in a whole domain (holomorphic) is the same as an analytic function. This is not true for real differentiable functions.\n\n== Simple example ==\nSuppose that ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''. The complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') = ''z''<sup>2</sup> is differentiable at any point ''z'' in the complex plane. \n:<math>f(z)=(x + i y)^{2} = x^{2} - y^{2} + 2ixy</math>\nThe real part ''u''(''x'', ''y'') and the imaginary part ''v''(''x'', ''y'') of ''f''(''z'') are\n:<math>u(x, y) = x^{2} - y^{2}</math>\n:<math>v(x, y)=2xy</math>\nrespectively. The partial derivatives of these are \n:<math>\\dfrac{ \\partial u }{ \\partial x } = 2x</math>\n:<math>\\dfrac{ \\partial u }{ \\partial y } = -2y</math>\n:<math>\\dfrac{ \\partial v }{ \\partial x } = 2y</math>\n:<math>\\dfrac{ \\partial v }{ \\partial y } = 2x</math>.\nThese partial derivatives have the following relationships: \n: <math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} </math>\n: <math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} </math>.\nThus this complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations.\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n(1a)\\qquad & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\\\[6pt]\n(1b)\\qquad & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n== Interpretation and reformulation ==\n\nThe equations are one way of looking at the condition on a function to be differentiable in the sense of [[complex analysis]]: in other words they encapsulate the notion of [[function of a complex variable]] by means of conventional [[differential calculus]]. In the theory there are several other major ways of looking at this notion, and the translation of the condition into other language is often needed.\n\n=== Conformal mappings ===\nFirst, the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations may be written in complex form\n\n:(2){{quad}}<math>{ i \\dfrac{ \\partial f }{ \\partial x } } = \\dfrac{ \\partial f }{ \\partial y } . </math>\n\nIn this form, the equations correspond structurally to the condition that the [[Jacobian matrix]] is of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a  \n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> a=\\partial u/\\partial x=\\partial v/\\partial y</math> and <math> b=\\partial v/\\partial x=-\\partial u/\\partial y</math>.  A matrix of this form is the [[Complex number#Matrix representation of complex numbers|matrix representation of a complex number]]. Geometrically, such a matrix is always the [[function composition|composition]] of a [[rotation]] with a [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]], and in particular preserves [[angle]]s. The Jacobian of a function ''f''(''z'') takes infinitesimal line segments at the intersection of two curves in z and rotates them to the corresponding segments in ''f''(''z''). Consequently, a function satisfying the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations, with a nonzero derivative, preserves the angle between curves in the plane.  That is, the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations are the conditions for a function to be [[conformal map|conformal]].\n\nMoreover, because the composition of a conformal transformation with another conformal transformation is also conformal, the composition of a solution of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations with a conformal map must itself solve the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations.  Thus the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations are conformally invariant.\n\n=== Complex differentiability ===\nSuppose that\n\n: <math> f(z) = u(z) + i \\cdot v(z) </math>\n\nis a function of a complex number ''z''.  Then the complex derivative of ''f'' at a point ''z''<sub>0</sub> is defined by\n\n: <math>\\lim_{\\underset{h\\in\\mathbf{C}}{h\\to 0}} \\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = f'(z_0)</math>\n\nprovided this limit exists.\n\nIf this limit exists, then it may be computed by taking the limit as ''h''&nbsp;\u2192 0 along the real axis or imaginary axis; in either case it should give the same result.  Approaching along the real axis, one finds\n\n:<math>\\lim_{\\underset{h\\in\\mathbf{R}}{h\\to 0}} \\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(z_0).</math>\n\nOn the other hand, approaching along the imaginary axis,\n\n:<math>\\lim_{\\underset{h\\in \\mathbf{R}}{h\\to 0}} \\frac{f(z_0+ih)-f(z_0)}{ih} =\\frac{1}{i}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(z_0).</math>\n\nThe equality of the derivative of ''f'' taken along the two axis is\n\n:<math>i\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(z_0)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(z_0),</math>\n\nwhich are the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations (2) at the point&nbsp;''z''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nConversely, if ''f''&nbsp;: '''C'''&nbsp;\u2192 '''C''' is a function which is differentiable when regarded as a function on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, then ''f'' is complex differentiable if and only if the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations hold. In other words, if u and v are real-differentiable functions of two real variables, obviously ''u'' + ''iv'' is a (complex-valued) real-differentiable function, but ''u'' + ''iv'' is complex-differentiable if and only if the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations hold.\n\nIndeed, following {{harvtxt|Rudin|1966}}, suppose ''f'' is a complex function defined in an open set \u03a9&nbsp;\u2282 '''C'''.  Then, writing {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y''}} for every ''z''&nbsp;\u2208 \u03a9, one can also regard \u03a9 as an open subset of '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, and ''f'' as a function of two real variables ''x'' and ''y'', which maps \u03a9&nbsp;\u2282 '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''C'''.  We consider the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations at ''z''&nbsp;= ''z''<sub>0</sub>. So assume ''f'' is differentiable at ''z''<sub>0</sub>, as a function of two real variables from \u03a9 to '''C'''.  This is equivalent to the existence of the following linear approximation\n\n:<math> f(z_0 + \\Delta z) - f(z_0) = f_x \\,\\Delta x + f_y \\,\\Delta y + \\eta(\\Delta z) \\,\\Delta z \\,</math>\n\nwhere ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy'' and ''\u03b7''(\u0394''z'') \u2192 0 as \u0394''z'' \u2192 0.  Since <math> \\Delta z + \\Delta \\bar{z}= 2 \\, \\Delta x </math> and <math> \\Delta z - \\Delta \\bar{z}=2i \\, \\Delta y </math>, the above can be re-written as\n\n:<math> \\Delta f(z_0) = \\frac{f_x - if_y}{2} \\, \\Delta z + \\frac{f_x + if_y}{2} \\, \\Delta \\bar{z} + \\eta(\\Delta z) \\, \\Delta z\\, </math>\n\nDefining the two [[Wirtinger derivatives]] as\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Bigl( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\Bigr), \\;\\;\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\bar{z}}= \\frac{1}{2} \\Bigl( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\Bigr),</math>\n<br />\nin the limit  <math>\\Delta z \\rightarrow 0,\\Delta \\bar{z} \\rightarrow 0</math> the above equality can be written as\n<br /><br />\n: <math>\\left.\\frac{df}{dz}\\right|_{z=z_0} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right |_{z=z_0} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\bar{z}}\\right |_{z=z_0} \\cdot \\frac{d\\bar{z}}{dz} + \\eta(\\Delta z), \\;\\;\\;\\;(\\Delta z \\neq 0). </math>\n\nNow consider the potential values of <math> d\\bar{z}/dz </math> when the limit is taken the origin. For ''z'' along the real line, <math> \\bar{z} = z </math> so that <math> d\\bar{z}/dz = 1</math>. Similarly for purely imaginary ''z'' we have <math> d\\bar{z}/dz = -1 </math> so that the value of <math> d\\bar{z}/dz</math> is not well defined at the origin. It's easy to verify that <math> d\\bar{z}/dz</math> is not well defined at any complex ''z'', hence ''f'' is complex differentiable at ''z''<sub>0</sub>  if and only if <math> (\\partial f/\\partial\\bar{z}) = 0 </math> at <math>z=z_0</math>.  But this is exactly the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations, thus ''f'' is differentiable at ''z''<sub>0</sub> if and only if the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations hold at&nbsp;''z''<sub>0</sub>.\n\n=== Independence of the complex conjugate ===\n\nThe above proof suggests another interpretation of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations.  The [[complex conjugate]] of ''z'', denoted <math>\\bar{z}</math>, is defined by\n\n:<math>\\overline{x + iy} := x - iy</math>\n\nfor real ''x'' and ''y''. The Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations can then be written as a single equation\n\n:(3){{quad}}<math>\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\bar{z}} = 0</math>\n\nby using the [[Wirtinger derivatives|Wirtinger derivative with respect to the conjugate variable]]. In this form, the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations can be interpreted as the statement that ''f'' is independent of the variable <math>\\bar{z}</math>. As such, we can view analytic functions as true functions of ''one'' complex variable as opposed to complex functions of ''two'' real variables.\n\n=== Physical interpretation ===\n[[File:Contours of holomorphic function.png|right|thumb|[[Contour plot]] of a pair ''u'' and ''v'' satisfying the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations.  Streamlines (''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;const, red) are perpendicular to equipotentials (''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;const, blue).  The point (0,0) is a stationary point of the potential flow, with six streamlines meeting, and six equipotentials also meeting and bisecting the angles formed by the streamlines.]]\nA standard physical interpretation of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations going back to Riemann's work on function theory (see {{harvnb|Klein|1893}}) is that ''u'' represents a [[velocity potential]] of an incompressible [[potential flow|steady fluid flow]] in the plane, and ''v'' is its [[stream function]].  Suppose that the pair of (twice continuously differentiable) functions <math>u,v</math> satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations.  We will take ''u'' to be a velocity potential, meaning that we imagine a flow of fluid in the plane such that the [[velocity vector]] of the fluid at each point of the plane is equal to the [[gradient]] of ''u'', defined by\n:<math>\\nabla u = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\mathbf i + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\mathbf j</math>\n\nBy differentiating the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations a second time, one shows that ''u'' solves [[Laplace's equation]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} = 0.</math>\nThat is, ''u'' is a [[harmonic function]].  This means that the [[divergence]] of the gradient is zero, and so the fluid is incompressible.\n\nThe function ''v'' also satisfies the Laplace equation, by a similar analysis.  Also, the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations imply that the [[dot product]] <math>\\nabla u\\cdot\\nabla v = 0</math>.  This implies that the gradient of ''u'' must point along the <math>v=\\text{const}</math> curves; so these are the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] of the flow.  The <math>u=\\text{const}</math> curves are the [[equipotential curve]]s of the flow.\n\nA holomorphic function can therefore be visualized by plotting the two families of [[level curve]]s <math>u=\\text{const}</math> and <math>v=\\text{const}</math>.  Near points where the gradient of ''u'' (or, equivalently, ''v'') is not zero, these families form an [[orthogonal]] family of curves.  At the points where <math>\\nabla u=0</math>, the stationary points of the flow, the equipotential curves of <math>u=\\text{const}</math> intersect.  The streamlines also intersect at the same point, bisecting the angles formed by the equipotential curves.\n\n=== Harmonic vector field ===\nAnother interpretation of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations can be found in {{harvtxt|P\u00f3lya|Szeg\u0151|1978}}.  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' satisfy the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations in an open subset of '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, and consider the [[vector field]]\n\n:<math>\\bar{f} = \\begin{bmatrix}u\\\\ -v\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nregarded as a (real) two-component vector.  Then the second Cauchy\u2013Riemann equation (1b) asserts that <math>\\bar{f}</math> is [[irrotational vector field|irrotational]] (its [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] is 0):\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial (-v)}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0.</math>\n\nThe first Cauchy\u2013Riemann equation (1a) asserts that the vector field is [[solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] (or [[divergence]]-free):\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (-v)}{\\partial y}=0.</math>\n\nOwing respectively to [[Green's theorem]] and the [[divergence theorem]], such a field is necessarily a [[conservative vector field|conservative]] one, and it is free from sources or sinks, having net flux equal to zero through any open domain without holes.  (These two observations combine as real and imaginary parts in [[Cauchy's integral theorem]].) In [[fluid dynamics]], such a vector field is a [[potential flow]] {{harv|Chanson|2007}}.  In [[magnetostatics]], such vector fields model static [[magnetic field]]s on a region of the plane containing no current.  In [[electrostatics]], they model static electric fields in a region of the plane containing no electric charge.\n\nThis interpretation can equivalently be restated in the language of [[differential form]]s.  The pair ''u'',''v'' satisfy the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations if and only if the [[one-form]] <math>v\\,dx + u\\, dy</math> is both [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed]] and [[codifferential|coclosed]] (a [[Hodge theory|harmonic differential form]]).\n\n=== Preservation of complex structure ===\nAnother formulation of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations involves the [[linear complex structure|complex structure]] in the plane, given by\n:<math>J=\\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThis is a complex structure in the sense that the square of ''J'' is the negative of the 2&times;2 identity matrix: <math>J^2=-I</math>.  As above, if ''u''(''x'',''y''),''v''(''x'',''y'') are two functions in the plane, put\n\n:<math>f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}u(x,y)\\\\v(x,y)\\end{bmatrix}.</math> \n\nThe [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' is the matrix of partial derivatives\n\n:<math>Df(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\[12pt] \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThen the pair of functions ''u'', ''v'' satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations if and only if the 2&times;2 matrix ''Df'' commutes with ''J'' {{harv|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1969|loc=Proposition IX.2.2}}\n\nThis interpretation is useful in [[symplectic geometry]], where it is the starting point for the study of [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s.\n\n=== Other representations ===\nOther representations of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations occasionally arise in other [[coordinate system]]s.  If (1a) and (1b) hold for a differentiable pair of functions ''u'' and ''v'', then so do\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial s},\\quad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n} = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial s}</math>\n\nfor any coordinate system {{nowrap|(''n''(''x'', ''y''), ''s''(''x'', ''y''))}} such that the pair (\u2207''n'', \u2207''s'') is [[orthonormal]] and [[orientation (mathematics)|positively oriented]].  As a consequence, in particular,  in the system of coordinates given by the polar representation {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''r''&thinsp;''e''<sup>i\u03b8</sup>}}, the equations then take the form\n\n:<math>{ \\partial u \\over \\partial r } = {1 \\over r}{ \\partial v \\over \\partial \\theta},\\quad{ \\partial v \\over \\partial r } = -{1 \\over r}{ \\partial u \\over \\partial \\theta}.</math>\n\nCombining these into one equation for ''f'' gives\n\n:<math>{\\partial f \\over \\partial r} = {1 \\over i r}{\\partial f \\over \\partial \\theta}.</math>\n\n\nThe inhomogeneous Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations consist of the two equations for a pair of unknown functions ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') of two real variables\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\alpha(x,y) \\\\[4pt]\n& \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\beta(x,y)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor some given functions \u03b1(''x'',''y'') and \u03b2(''x'',''y'') defined in an open subset of '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.  These equations are usually combined into a single equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\bar{z}} = \\varphi(z,\\bar{z})</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' = ''u'' + i''v'' and ''\u03c6'' = (''\u03b1'' + i''\u03b2'')/2.\n\nIf ''\u03c6'' is [[continuously differentiable|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>]], then the inhomogeneous equation is explicitly solvable in any bounded domain ''D'', provided ''\u03c6'' is continuous on the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''D''.  Indeed, by the [[Cauchy integral formula]],\n\n:<math>f(\\zeta,\\bar{\\zeta}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\iint_D \\varphi(z,\\bar{z}) \\, \\frac{dz\\wedge d\\bar{z}}{z-\\zeta}</math>\n\nfor all \u03b6 \u2208 ''D''.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n=== Goursat's theorem and its generalizations ===\n{{see also|Cauchy\u2013Goursat theorem}}\n\nSuppose that {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''u''&thinsp;+&thinsp;i''v''}} is a complex-valued function which is [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative|differentiable]] as a function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}.  Then '''[[\u00c9douard Goursat|Goursat]]'s theorem''' asserts that ''f'' is analytic in an open complex domain \u03a9 if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equation in the domain {{harv|Rudin|1966|loc=Theorem 11.2}}. In particular, continuous differentiability of ''f'' need not be assumed {{harv|Dieudonn\u00e9|1969|loc=\u00a79.10, Ex. 1}}.\n\nThe hypotheses of Goursat's theorem can be weakened significantly.  If {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''u''&thinsp;+&thinsp;i''v''}} is continuous in an open set \u03a9 and the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f'' with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' exist in \u03a9, and satisfy the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations throughout \u03a9, then ''f'' is holomorphic (and thus analytic).  This result is the [[Looman\u2013Menchoff theorem]].\n\nThe hypothesis that ''f'' obey the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations throughout the domain \u03a9 is essential.  It is possible to construct a continuous function satisfying the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations at a point, but which is not analytic at the point (e.g., ''f''(''z'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''z''<sup>5</sup>&thinsp;/&thinsp;{{!}}z{{!}}<sup>4</sup>)}}.  Similarly, some additional assumption is needed besides the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations (such as continuity), as the following example illustrates {{harv|Looman|1923|p=107}}\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\begin{cases}\n\\exp(-z^{-4})&\\text{if }z\\not=0\\\\\n0&\\text{if }z=0\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations everywhere, but fails to be continuous at ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nNevertheless, if a function satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations in an open set in a [[weak derivative|weak sense]], then the function is analytic.  More precisely {{harv|Gray|Morris|1978|loc=Theorem 9}}:\n* If ''f''(''z'') is locally integrable in an open domain \u03a9&nbsp;\u2282&nbsp;'''C''', and satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations weakly, then ''f'' agrees [[almost everywhere]] with an analytic function in \u03a9.\nThis is in fact a special case of a more general result on the regularity of solutions of [[hypoelliptic operator|hypoelliptic]] partial differential equations.\n===Several variables===\nThere are Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations, appropriately generalized, in the theory of [[several complex variables]]. They form a significant [[overdetermined system]] of PDEs. This is done using a straightforward generalization of the [[Wirtinger derivative]], where the function in question is required to have the (partial) Wirtinger derivative with respect to each complex variable vanish.\n\n===Complex differential forms===\nAs often formulated, the ''[[d-bar operator]]'' \n\n:<math>\\bar{\\partial}</math>\n\nannihilates holomorphic functions. This generalizes most directly the formulation\n\n:<math>{\\partial f \\over \\partial \\bar z} = 0,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>{\\partial f \\over \\partial \\bar z} = {1 \\over 2}\\left({\\partial f \\over \\partial x} + i{\\partial f \\over \\partial y}\\right).</math>\n\n=== B\u00e4cklund transform ===\nViewed as [[conjugate harmonic functions]], the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations are a simple example of a [[B\u00e4cklund transform]]. More complicated, generally non-linear B\u00e4cklund transforms, such as in the [[sine-Gordon equation]], are of great interest in the theory of [[soliton]]s and [[integrable system]]s.\n\n=== Definition in Clifford algebra ===\n\nIn [[Clifford algebra]] the complex number <math>z = x+iy </math> is represented as <math>z \\equiv x + I y</math> where <math>I \\equiv \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2</math>. The fundamental derivative operator in Clifford algebra of [[Complex numbers]] is defined as <math>\\nabla \\equiv \\sigma_1 \\partial_x + \\sigma_2\\partial_y</math>.

For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, this system is equivalent to the standard Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations of complex variables, and the solutions are holomorphic functions.

In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging [[Restoration Movement]] in the US at the time. This movement sought a reform based upon the [[Sola scriptura|Bible alone]] as a sufficient guide and rejected all [[creed]]s. However, this liberality eventually led to dissent as John Thomas developed his personal beliefs and began to question mainstream orthodox Christian beliefs.  While the Restoration Movement accepted Thomas's right to have his own beliefs, when he started preaching that they were essential to [[salvation]], it led to a fierce series of debates with a notable [[leadership|leader]] of the movement, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]].  John Thomas believed that scripture, as God's word, did not support a multiplicity of differing beliefs, and challenged the leaders to continue with the process of restoring 1st-century Christian beliefs and correct interpretation through a process of debate.  The history of this process appears in the book ''Dr. Thomas, His Life and Work'' (1873) by a Christadelphian, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]].<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html |title=Dr Thomas: His Life and Work |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period of formulating his ideas John Thomas was [[baptism|baptised]] twice,<ref> the Bible states there is one baptism,  why was Thomas baptized twice, is unknown. \nJohn Thomas was baptised by Walter Scott of the Disciples of Christ in 1832 and again in 1847 (probably by John Tomline Walsh, according to Peter Hemingray ''John Thomas\u2014His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p.145) after publishing ''A Confession and Abjuration'' in which he renounced previously held beliefs as false.</ref> the second time after renouncing the beliefs he previously held.

Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with books and journals, such as Thomas's ''Herald of the Kingdom''.\n[[Image:John_Thomas.png|left|thumb|150px|Brother John Thomas]]\nIn his desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone. Among other churches, he had links with [[Adventism|Adventist]] movement and with [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] (who later set up the [[Church of the Blessed Hope|Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith]] in the 1860s). In terms of his rejection of the trinity, Thomas' views had certain similarities with Unitarianism which had developed in a formal way in Europe in the 16th century (although he formally described both Unitarianism and Socinianism as \"works of the devil\" for their failure to develop his doctrine of God-manifestation).<ref>Thomas, J.

Through that process a number of people became convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position.

In 1864 he began to publish ''The Ambassador of the Coming Age'' magazine. John Thomas, out of concern that someone else might start a publication and call it ''The Christadelphian'', urged Robert Roberts to change the name of his magazine to ''[[The Christadelphian]]''<ref>Bryan R.

Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864\u20131885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p.399.</ref>\n\nInitially the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the [[English Midlands]] and in parts{{which|date=October 2013}} of North America. In the early days after the death of John Thomas the group could have moved in a number of directions. Doctrinal issues arose, debates took place and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose. These attempts were felt necessary by many{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error. As a result of these debates, several groups separated from the main body of Christadelphians, most notably the Suffolk Street fellowship and the Unamended fellowship.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]] the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the [[Kindertransport]], helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution and founding a hostel [[Elpis Lodge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kinderball piano score |publisher=Imperial War Museum |url=http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127013116/http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |archivedate=27 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Morrell | first=Leslie | title=The Christadelphian Response to the Holocaust | url=http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-02-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227081848/http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf | archivedate=2008-02-27 | df= }}</ref> In Germany the small Christadelphian community founded by [[Albert Maier]] went underground from 1940\u20131945, and a leading brother, [[Albert Merz]], was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.<ref>April 1941 in Berlin.Bogner, Gustav.

This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organized [[wiktionary:autonomous|autonomously]], typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Most ecclesias have a constitution,<ref>Example: [http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/constitution.htm Constitution of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia, Midland Institute] c.1932-onwards</ref> which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalized list of 'The Commandments of Christ'.<ref>This list as published by [[The Christadelphian Magazine]] contains 53 paraphrases of Bible verses which were originally read weekly as part of the service at Temperance Hall ecclesia. Other versions, of unconfirmed origin, exist with the list expanded to 100 including some verses justifying division.</ref> With no central authority, individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to [[excommunication]]) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 32, 35\u201336</ref>\n\nThe relative uniformity of organization and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history by Robert Roberts, called ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.<ref name=\"online\">Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883).

Male members are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational governance typically follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.\n\nInter-ecclesial organizations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools<ref>For example: Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Cooranbong)|Heritage College, Cooranbong]] and Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Sydney)|Heritage College Sydney]], Kemps Creek.</ref> and elderly care homes, the [[Christadelphian Isolation League]] (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of [[:Category:Christadelphian magazines|Christadelphian magazines]].\n\n=== Adherents ===\nNo official membership figures are published, but the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' gives an estimated figure of 50,000 Christadelphians.<ref name=\"exrydu\">[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Christad 'Christadelphians'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728003246/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Christad |date=July 28, 2011 }}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''</ref> They are spread across approximately 120 countries;<ref name = \"xbcrcq\">''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006</ref> there are established churches (often referred to as ''ecclesias'') in many of those countries,<ref>''Ecclesias Around the World'' from [http://www.christadelphia.org/ecclesia.htm Christadelphia World Wide]</ref> along with isolated members.

This puts the total figure at around 67,000.\n\n=== Fellowships ===\nThe Christadelphian body consists of a number of ''fellowships'' \u2013 groups of ecclesias which associate with one another, often to the exclusion of ecclesias outside their group. They are to some degree localised. The Unamended Fellowship, for example, exists only in North America. Christadelphian fellowships have often been named after ecclesias or magazines who took a lead in developing a particular stance.\n\nThe majority of Christadelphians today (around 60,000<ref>Estimate from CALS directory and national statistics in the Adherents section of this article.</ref>) belong to what is commonly known as the ''Central fellowship''. <ref name=\"Birmingham 1933, p. 376\"> The first use of the term \"Birmingham (Central) fellowship\" in ''The Christadelphian'' magazine was in volume 70, 1933, p. 376.</ref> The term \"Central\" came into use around 1933 to distinguish those majority ecclesias worldwide who were in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) Ecclesia, from those minority ecclesias of the \"Suffolk Street fellowship\" who had been collectively withdrawn from in 1885 over disagreements surrounding the inspiration of the Bible. This had begun when Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged Christadelphian belief, stating that some parts of the Holy Scriptures were with error and therefore uninspired. Although he later left the community, this led to a division in the main body where his doctrinal influence remained. Robert Ashcroft's sympathisers in Birmingham, England formed a separate Ecclesia in local Suffolk Street and ecclesias which supported their position became known as the \"Suffolk Street fellowship\". Those in local Birmingham, who maintained that the Holy Scriptures were divinely inspired in all their parts and were without error except as may be due to errors of transcription or translation, formed a separate Ecclesia in nearby Temperance Hall and ecclesias throughout the world which supported their position became known as the \"Temperance Hall Fellowship\". Meanwhile in Australia, division had ensued surrounding the subject of the \"Clean Flesh\" of Jesus Christ. The minority who believed Christ's nature was immaculate and therefore his flesh did not have the potential to sin formed the \"Shield Fellowship\". These soon became closely associated with the \"Suffolk Street Fellowship\" as their sympathisers, and also those known as the Dowieite community who had been previously disfellowshipped from the main body over disagreement surrounding the Biblical devil and evil spirits. The majority who believed Christ was born with the same flesh as his Brethren and thus had the ability to sin in his flesh but chose not to continued as members of the \"Temperance Hall Fellowship\". By 1939 the \"Temperance Hall\" members in Birmingham had relocated and were increasingly known as the \"Birmingham Central Christadelphians\", but before long the word \"Birmingham\" was dropped and the term \"Central Fellowship\" began to be used with some regularity among the next generations of Christadelphians in the UK. <ref>(342 times between 1939 and 2000) in ''[[The Christadelphian]]'' magazine</ref>  After the First and Second World Wars it was felt that a gradual relaxation of traditional fellowship practice needed to take place and the discussions of 1957-1958 resulted in a worldwide reunion between the majority Christadelphians of the \"Temperance Hall Fellowship\" and the minority \"Suffolk Street Fellowship\", closely followed in Australia by the minority \"Shield Fellowship\" and the Dowieite community. Birmingham Central Hall Christadelphians, where the formal meetings and unification papers were signed officially decreed the reunion as official, and the \"Central Fellowship\" was born. Reunion was also made official to the rest of the worldwide Christadelphians on the basis of the understanding of the atonement of Christ, expressed in a document called the Cooper-Carter Addendum (this was soon added to the BASF).  \n\nThe ''[[Unamended Christadelphians|Unamended fellowship]]'', consisting of around 1,850 members, is found in the East Coast and Midwest USA and Ontario, Canada.<ref>Verified figure, Ecclesial Directory 2006. Parts of grouping currently involved in unity talks with Central.</ref> This group separated in 1898 as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgment at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgment will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptized believers.<ref>The Sydney Ecclesia, Australia had already \"disfellowshipped\" 10 members for denying this in 1883. The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, ecclesial news p.90 and editorial comment p.382</ref> The majority in Britain, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment became known as the \"Unamended fellowship\" and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy.<ref>For example: [http://www.genusa.com/Truth/UnamendedErrors.html Website] claiming views held by Amended community were original Christadelphian beliefs Versus [http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html Website] claiming views held by Unamended community were original Christadelphian beliefs.</ref> Prominent in the formation of the Unamended fellowship was [[Thomas Williams (Christadelphian)|Thomas Williams]], editor of the Christadelphian Advocate magazine. The majority of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America joined the Suffolk Street fellowship before its eventual incorporation into Central fellowship. There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America \u2013 most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended and Unamended ecclesias have opened fellowship to one another despite the failure of wider attempts at re-union under the North American Statement of Understanding (NASU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasu.ca |title=North American Statement of Understanding |publisher=Nasu.ca |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> The \"Central Fellowship\" in North America is still often referred to today as the ''[[Amended Christadelphians|Amended fellowship]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Berean Christadelphians|Berean Fellowship]]'' was formed in 1923 as a result of varying views on military service in Britain, and on the atonement in North America. The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952. A number continue as a separate community, numbering around 200 in Texas, 100 in Kenya and 30 in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bereanecclesialnews.com/|title=The Berean Ecclesial News|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the Berean fellowship.<ref>Phillips, Jim, ''The Berean Christadelphians: Why the Bereans?''

Ecclesias forming the Old Paths Fellowship arose in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada numbering around 500 members in total. Due to a proportionally large number of members in the UK joining the Central Fellowship in and around 2014, their numbers have reduced to around 250 members in total (Around 100 members in the UK, and around 150 in Australasia). \n\nOther Fellowships which openly identify themselves as Christadelphians will have various numbers ranging from as few as 10 to over 200 members. Examples are the ''Watchman Fellowship'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphian-watchman-fellowship.org |title=Christadelphian Watchman Fellowship |publisher=Christadelphian-watchman-fellowship.org</ref> the ''Companion Fellowship''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://companionchristadelphians.com/ |title=Companion Christadelphians |publisher=Companion Christadelphians |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> and the ''Pioneer Fellowship''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pioneerchristadelphians.org |title=Pioneer Christadelphians | publisher=Pioneer Christadelphians |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFellowship groups which are considered by the larger communities to be part of the \"wider Christadelphian Brotherhood\" are also very much in existence, some for as few as 30 years, others for the best part of a century. Although being Christadelphian in origin and sharing many Christadelphian teachings, these Fellowship groups have renounced the popularly held name due to its public association with what they believe to be false teachings and/or practice within the Christadelphian community. These groups consider constituents of the One Body to be those within their own separate communities and therefore fellowship on that basis. Some examples are: The \"Nazarene Fellowship\" [http://www.nazarenefellowship.com/]; The \"Ecclesia of Christ\" Fellowship; The \"Remnant of Christ's Ecclesia\" Fellowship [http://www.remnantofchristsecclesia.com]; The \"Apostolic Fellowship of Christ\" Fellowship [http://www.theapostolicfellowshipofchrist.com/]; \"The Apostolic Ecclesias\" Fellowship [http://www.bible-truth.co.uk/]. While quality of fellowship on biblical grounds are said to be emphasised rather than quantity, numbers of members may range from as few as two or three individuals in a fellowship, to a fellowship consisting of 50 or more spread over a number of Ecclesias. For example, the Apostolic Ecclesias [http://www.bible-truth.co.uk/] can be located in the UK (Dartford & Maidenhead, England; Cupar, Scotland); Southern Kenya (Mwangwei); and Western Kenya (Bungoma & Nalondo). Whereas the \"Household of Christ\" Fellowship, for example, can only be found in  Nottingham, UK. While some of these groups may be considered exclusive in their approach, most openly continue their public witness in the locations they are found [https://www.facebook.com/BibleTruthTalks/], even tailoring their advertising towards the popular Christadelphians in an endeavour to restore them to what they believe to be a correct understanding of Bible teaching and Biblical fellowship [https://www.facebook.com/ForTheEarnestChristadelphian/?pnref=lhc].\n\nThe [[Church of the Blessed Hope|Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith (CGAF)]] also has common origins with Christadelphians and shares Christadelphian beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cotbh.org/what-do-we-believe-teach/|title=What Do We Believe & Teach? \u2013 Church of the Blessed Hope|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> Numbering around 400 (primarily Ohio and Florida, USA),<ref>From CGAF directory.</ref> they are welcomed into fellowship by some \"Central\" Christadelphians and are currently involved in unity talks.\n\nAccording to [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]], functionally the definition of a \"fellowship\" within Christadelphian history has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread.<ref>See Wilson op.cit.</ref> This functional definition still holds true in North America, where the Unamended fellowship and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith are not received by most North American [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended]] ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many articles and books on the doctrine and practice of fellowship now reject the notion itself of separate \"fellowships\" among those who recognise the same baptism, viewing such separations as schismatic.<ref>[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/oates-pearce-1957-booklet-fellowship-and-withdrawal.doc Oates & Pearce ''Fellowship and Withdrawal'' (doc)] 1957<p>{{*}}[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/whittaker_fellowship_1973.doc H.A.

Within the Central fellowship individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community. Some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the 'Breaking of Bread' service. Others tolerate a degree of divergence from commonly held Christadelphian views.\n\nMinority Fellowship groups also recognised by the larger Fellowships to be part of the wider Christadelphian Brotherhood will likewise conform to the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith with particular amendments in their Doctrines to be Rejected, which results in their separation from one another. Some have revised previous statements of faith to include clarity on controversies that have arisen over the last 170 years. While some communities of Christadelphian origin have viewed previous statements of faith as set in stone, others have felt it necessary to revise them in order to meet contemporary issues which challenge the Scriptures and may weaken what they believe to be the True Faith. Some communities have completely revised the statements of faith in language to be easily understood, supported by the references to the relevant quotations. An example can be found here: [http://docs-eu.livesiteadmin.com/6a44e37e-e0e0-4935-a8f7-4aaa7ab001df/aeconfession-of-faith.pdf]\n\nFor each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their \"home ecclesia\" is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia.\n\n== Beliefs ==\nDue to the way the Christadelphian body is organised there is no central authority to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs and it depends upon what statement of faith is adhered to and how liberal the ecclesia is, but there are core doctrines most Christadelphians would accept.  In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found. For instance in the Central fellowship, the BASF, the standard statement of faith has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.\n\n=== The Bible ===\nChristadelphians state that their beliefs<ref>See, e.g., the ''[http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith]''</ref> are based wholly on the [[Bible]],<ref name=\"hyndman\"/> and they do not see other works as inspired by [[God]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Bull  | first =Mike| title =The Bible\u2014The Word of God | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_bible.htm | isbn =81-87409-52-5 }}</ref> They regard the Bible as inspired by God and, therefore, believe that in its original form, it is error free and errors in later copies are due to errors of transcription or translation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm |title=The Christadelphian Statement of Faith |publisher=Christadelphia.org |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> Based on this, Christadelphians teach what they believe as true Bible teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz |title=True Bible Teaching Home |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.com/teaching/12-the-bible-our-guide.html |title=True Bible Teaching Teaching |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>\n\n=== God ===\nChristadelphians believe that God is the creator of all things and the father of true believers,<ref>{{cite book | last =Drabbenstott | first =Mark| title =God Our Father | publisher =Printland Publishers | year=2000 | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_father.htm | isbn =81-87409-64-9}}</ref> that he is a separate being from his son, [[Jesus]] Christ,<ref name=\"trinity1\">{{cite book | last =Flint | first =James |author2=Deb Flint | title =One God or a Trinity? | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm | isbn =81-87409-61-4}}</ref><ref name=\"jesus\">{{cite book|title=Jesus: God the Son or Son of God? |publisher=CMPA |location=Birmingham, UK |url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/jesussonofgod.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217023904/http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/jesussonofgod.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}</ref> and that the [[Holy Spirit#Christadelphians|Holy Spirit]] is the power of God used in creation and for [[Salvation#Salvation|salvation]].<ref name=\"spirit\">{{cite book | last =Tennant| first =Harry | title =The Holy Spirit\u2014Bible Understanding of God's Power | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/holysprt.htm }}</ref> They also believe that the phrase ''Holy Spirit'' sometimes refers to God's character/mind, depending on the context in which the phrase appears,<ref name=\"trinity2\">{{cite book|last=Broughton |first=James H. |authorlink= |author2=Peter J Southgate |title=The Trinity: True or False? |publisher=The Dawn Book Supply |location=UK |pages= |url=http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm |doi= |id= |isbn= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118003323/http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm |archivedate=18 November 2011 }}</ref> but reject the view that people need strength, guidance and power from the Holy Spirit to live the Christian life,<ref>{{cite book | last =Whittaker | first =Edward | last2 =Carr| first2 =Reg | title ='Spirit' in the New Testament| publisher =The Testimony | location = | url = }}, p. 117,132,145</ref> believing instead that the spirit a believer needs within themselves is the mind/character of God, which is developed in a believer by their reading of the Bible (which, they believe, contains words God gave by his Spirit) and trying to live by what it says during the events of their lives which God uses to help shape their character.<ref>{{cite book | last =Pearce| first =Graham | title =The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Gifts| publisher =Logos | location = | url =http://www.antipas.org/books/holy_spirit_pearce/hsp_toc.html }}, p. 27-29.

Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a \"good confession\" (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements \u2013 \"first principles\" \u2013 of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian [[Sunday Schools]] and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings. Many ecclesias organise holidays for young people, the most popular form in the UK being [[camping]] holidays and Youth Weekends such as Swanwick and others locally organised by different ecclesias.\n\nChristadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Ashton\n | first = Michael\n | title = Women Priests?

They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday Schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.\n\nThere are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated [[evangelism|preaching]], youth and Sunday School work, [[conscientious objection]] issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support.

Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose.

In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the [[Psalter|Scottish Psalter]] and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[John Newton]].  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.<ref>'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>\n\nThe earliest hymn book published was the \"Sacred Melodist\" which was published by [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] in Geneva, Illinois in 1860.<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Rachel |last=Hocking |title=A Study of Christadelphian Hymnody: singing with the spirit and with the understanding |date=2000 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |publisher=The University ofNew South Wales, Sydney}}</ref> The next was the hymn book published for the use of ''Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'' (an early name for Christadelphians)<ref name = \"anrvrv\">Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 235</ref> by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.<ref>Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864\u20131885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p. 326</ref> In 1865 [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]] published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called ''The Golden Harp'' (which was subtitled \"Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'\").<ref>Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 195</ref> This was replaced only five years later by the first \"Christadelphian Hymn Book\" (1869), compiled by J.

In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.\n\nSome ecclesias use the ''Praise the Lord'' songbook.<ref>''Praise the Lord'' (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000)</ref> It was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available.  Another publication, the \"Worship\" book<ref>{{cite web |title=Worship |work=Worship Book Committee, NCC, 2008, 2010 |url=http://www.theworshipbook.com |publisher=Theworshipbook.com |accessdate= }}</ref> is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, etc) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands<ref>An example is the Christadelphian folk rock band [[Fisher's Tale]] (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship)</ref> and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.\n\nIn other countries, hymn books have been produced in local languages,<ref>e.g. ''Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus'' (Netherlands, circa 1980)</ref> sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture.  It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.<ref>'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Bibliography of Christadelphians]]\n* Fred Pearce, ''Who are the Christadelphians?

This contrasts with [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]] (also known as terrestrial television), in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by [[radio wave]]s and received by a [[television antenna]] attached to the television; or [[satellite television]], in which the television signal is transmitted by a [[communications satellite]] orbiting the Earth and received by a [[satellite dish]] on the roof.   [[FM radio]] programming, [[high-speed Internet]], [[Telephony|telephone service]]s, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.   [[Analog television]] was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to [[digital cable]] operation.\n\nA \"cable channel\" (sometimes known as a \"cable network\") is a television network available via cable television. When available through [[satellite television]], including direct broadcast satellite providers such as [[DirecTV]], [[Dish Network]] and [[Sky plc|Sky]], as well as via IPTV providers such as [[Verizon FIOS]] and [[AT&T U-verse]] is referred to as a \"satellite channel\". Alternative terms include \"non-broadcast channel\" or \"programming service\", the latter being mainly used in legal contexts. Examples of cable/satellite channels/cable networks available in many countries are [[HBO]], [[Cinemax]], [[MTV]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[AXN]], [[E!]], [[Fox Life]], [[Discovery Channel]], [[Canal+]], [[Eurosport]], [[Fox Sports]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[CNN International]], [[ESPN]] and [[GMA Pinoy TV|GMA International]].\n\nThe abbreviation '''CATV''' is often used for cable television. It originally stood for ''Community Access Television'' or ''Community Antenna Television'', from cable television's origins in 1948. In areas where over-the-air TV reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable ''[[broadcasting]]'' for radio are even older as radio programming was [[Linjesender|distributed by cable]] in some European cities as far back as 1924.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:H\u00dcP von KBW.JPG|thumb|A cable television distribution box ''(left)'' in the basement of a building in Germany, with a splitter ''(right)'' which supplies the signal to separate cables which go to different rooms]]\nTo receive cable television at a given location, cable distribution lines must be available on the local utility poles or underground utility lines. [[Coaxial cable]] brings the signal to the customer's building through a ''[[service drop]]'', an overhead or underground cable. If the subscriber's building does not have a cable service drop, the cable company will install one. The standard cable used in the U.S. is [[RG-6]], which has a 75 ohm impedance, and connects with a type [[F connector]]. The cable company's portion of the wiring usually ends at a distribution box on the building exterior, and built-in cable wiring in the walls usually distributes the signal to jacks in different rooms to which televisions are connected. Multiple cables to different rooms are split off the incoming cable with a small device called a [[Power dividers and directional couplers|splitter]]. There are two standards for cable television; older [[analog cable]], and newer [[digital cable]] which can carry data signals used by [[digital television]] receivers such as [[high-definition television|HDTV]] equipment. All cable companies in the United States have switched to or are in the course of switching to digital cable television since it was first introduced in the late 1990s.\n\nMost cable companies require a [[set-top box]] to view their cable channels, even on newer televisions with digital cable [[QAM (television)|QAM]] tuners, because most digital cable channels are now encrypted, or \"scrambled\", to reduce [[Cable television piracy|cable service theft]].  A cable from the jack in the wall is attached to the input of the box, and an output cable from the box is attached to the television, usually the RF-IN or composite input on older TVs. Since the set-top box only decodes the single channel that is being watched, each television in the house requires a separate box. Some unencrypted channels, usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks, can be displayed without a receiver box.<ref>{{cite web|title=ClearQAM \u2013 What It Is And Why It Matters|url=http://avc.com/2012/02/clearqam-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/|accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref> The cable company will provide set top boxes based on the level of service a customer purchases, from basic set top boxes with a [[standard definition]] picture connected through the standard coaxial connection on the TV, to high-definition wireless [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] receivers connected via [[HDMI]] or [[component video|component]]. Older [[analog television]] sets are \"cable ready\" and can receive the old [[analog cable]] without a set-top box.  To receive digital cable channels on an [[analog television]] set, even unencrypted ones, requires a different type of box, a [[digital television adapter]] supplied by the cable company. A new distribution method that takes advantage of the low cost high quality DVB distribution to residential areas, uses [[TV gateway]]s to convert the [[DVB-C]], [[DVB-C2]] stream to IP for distribution of TV over IP network in the home.\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[File:HFC Network Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Diagram of a modern [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] cable television system. At the regional ''[[cable television headend|headend]]'', the TV channels are sent multiplexed on a light beam which travels through [[optical fiber]] trunklines, which fan out from ''distribution hubs'' to ''optical nodes'' in local communities. Here the light signal from the fiber is translated to a [[radio frequency]] electrical signal, which is distributed through [[coaxial cable]] to individual subscriber homes.]]\n\nIn the most common system, multiple television channels (as many as 500, although this varies depending on the provider's available channel capacity) are distributed to subscriber residences through a [[coaxial cable]], which comes from a trunkline supported on [[utility pole]]s originating at the cable company's local distribution facility, called the \"[[cable television headend|headend]]\". Many channels can be transmitted through one coaxial cable by a technique called [[frequency division multiplexing]]. At the headend, each television channel is translated to a different [[frequency]]. By giving each channel a different frequency \"slot\" on the cable, the separate television signals do not interfere with each other.  At an [[Cable box (outside)|outdoor cable box]] on the subscriber's residence the company's service drop cable is connected to cables distributing the signal to different rooms in the building.  At each television, the subscriber's television or a set-top box provided by the cable company translates the desired channel back to its original frequency ([[baseband]]), and it is displayed onscreen. Due to widespread [[cable television piracy|cable theft]] in earlier analog systems, the signals are typically [[Encryption|encrypted]] on modern digital cable systems, and the set-top box must be activated by an [[activation code]] sent by the cable company before it will function, which is only sent after the subscriber signs up. If the subscriber fails to pay their bill, the cable company can send a signal to deactivate the subscriber's box, preventing reception.\n\nThere are also usually \"[[upstream (networking)|upstream]]\" channels on the cable to send data from the customer box to the cable headend, for advanced features such as requesting [[pay-per-view]] shows or movies, [[cable internet access]], and [[cable telephony|cable telephone service]]. The \"[[downstream (networking)|downstream]]\" channels occupy a band of [[frequency|frequencies]] from approximately 50&nbsp;MHz to 1&nbsp;GHz, while the \"[[upstream (networking)|upstream]]\" channels occupy frequencies of 5 to 42&nbsp;MHz. Subscribers pay with a monthly fee. Subscribers can choose from several levels of service, with \"premium\" packages including more channels but costing a higher rate. At the local headend, the feed signals from the individual television channels are received by [[parabolic dish|dish antennas]] from [[communication satellite]]s. Additional local channels, such as local [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] stations, [[educational television|educational channel]]s from local colleges, and [[community access]] channels devoted to local governments ([[public, educational, and government access|PEG]] channels) are usually included on the cable service. [[television advertisement|Commercial]] advertisements for local business are also [[Local insertion#Cable television|inserted in the programming]] at the headend (the individual channels, which are distributed nationally, also have their own nationally oriented commercials).\n\n===Hybrid fiber-coaxial===\n{{Main article|Hybrid fibre-coaxial}}\n\nModern cable systems are large, with a single network and headend often serving an entire [[metropolitan area]]. Most systems use [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) distribution; this means the trunklines that carry the signal from the headend to local neighborhoods are [[optical fiber]] to provide greater bandwidth and also extra capacity for future expansion. At the headend, the [[radio frequency]] electrical signal carrying all the channels is modulated on a light beam and sent through the fiber. The fiber trunkline goes to several ''distribution hubs'', from which multiple fibers fan out to carry the signal to boxes called ''optical nodes'' in local communities. At the optical node, the light beam from the fiber is translated back to an electrical signal and carried by [[coaxial cable]] distribution lines on utility poles, from which cables branch out to a series of signal amplifiers and line extenders. These devices carry the signal to customers via passive RF devices called taps.\n\n==History in North America==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{more|Cable television in the United States}}\nCable television began in the United States as a commercial business in 1950, although there were small-scale systems by [[hobbyist]]s in the 1940s.\n\nThe early systems simply received weak ([[broadcast]]) channels, amplified them, and sent them over unshielded wires to the subscribers, limited to a community or to adjacent communities. The receiving antenna would be higher than any individual subscriber could afford, thus bringing in stronger signals; in hilly or mountainous terrain it would be placed at a high elevation.\n\nAt the outset, cable systems only served smaller communities without television stations of their own, and which could not easily receive signals from stations in cities because of distance or hilly terrain. In Canada, however, communities with their own signals were fertile cable markets, as viewers wanted to receive American signals. Rarely, as in the college town of [[Alfred, New York]], U.S. cable systems retransmitted Canadian channels.\n\nAlthough early ([[VHF]]) television receivers could receive 12 channels (2-13), the maximum number of channels that could be broadcast in one city was 7: channels 2, 4, either 5 or 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13, as receivers at the time were unable to receive strong (local) signals on adjacent channels without distortion. (There were frequency gaps between 4 and 5, and between 6 and 7, which allowed both to be used in the same city).\n\nAs equipment improved, all twelve channels could be utilized, except where a local VHF television station broadcast.  Local broadcast channels were not usable for signals deemed to be priority, but technology allowed low-priority signals to be placed on such channels by synchronizing their [[blanking interval]]s.  Similarly, a local VHF station could not be carried on its broadcast channel as the signals would arrive at the TV set slightly separated in time, causing \"[[ghosting (television)|ghosting]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe bandwidth of the amplifiers also was limited, meaning frequencies over 250&nbsp;MHz were difficult to transmit to distant portions of the coaxial network, and UHF channels could not be used at all.  To expand beyond 12 channels, non-standard \"midband\" channels had to be used, located between the FM band and Channel 7, or \"superband\" beyond Channel 13 up to about 300&nbsp;MHz; these channels initially were only accessible using separate tuner boxes that sent the chosen channel into the TV set on Channel 2, 3 or 4.{{Citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\nBefore being added to the cable box itself, these midband channels were used for early incarnations of [[pay TV]], e.g. The [[Z Channel]] (Los Angeles) and [[HBO]] but transmitted in the clear i.e. not scrambled as standard TV sets of the period could not pick up the signal nor could the average consumer `de-tune' the normal stations to be able to receive it.\n\nOnce tuners that could receive select mid-band and super-band channels began to be incorporated into standard television sets, broadcasters were forced to either install scrambling circuitry or move these signals further out of the range of reception for early cable-ready TVs and VCRs. However, once all 181 allocated cable channels{{which|date=November 2017}} had been incorporated, premium broadcasters were left with no choice but to scramble.\n\nUnfortunately for pay-TV operators, the descrambling circuitry was often published in electronics hobby magazines such as ''[[Popular Science]]'' and ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' allowing anybody with anything more than a rudimentary knowledge of broadcast electronics to be able to build their own and receive the programming without cost.\n\nLater, the cable operators began to carry [[FM radio]] stations, and encouraged subscribers to connect their FM stereo sets to cable. Before [[multichannel television sound|stereo and bilingual TV sound]] became common, Pay-TV channel sound was added to the FM stereo cable line-ups.  About this time, operators expanded beyond the 12-channel dial to use the \"midband\" and \"superband\" VHF channels adjacent to the \"high band\" 7-13 of [[North American television frequencies]].  Some operators as in [[Cornwall, Ontario]], used a dual distribution network with Channels 2-13 on each of the two cables.\n\nDuring the 1980s, United States regulations not unlike [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) created the beginning of cable-originated [[live television]] programming. As cable penetration increased, numerous cable-only TV stations were launched, many with their own news bureaus that could provide more immediate and more localized content than that provided by the nearest network newscast.\n\nSuch stations may use similar on-air branding as that used by the nearby broadcast network affiliate, but the fact that these stations do not broadcast over the air and are not regulated by the FCC, their call signs are meaningless. These stations evolved partially into today's over-the-air digital subchannels, where a main broadcast TV station e.g. NBS 37* would \u2013 in the case of no local CNB or ABS station being available \u2013 rebroadcast the programming from a nearby affiliate but fill in with its own news and other community programming to suit its own locale. Many live [[local program]]s with local interests were subsequently created all over the United States in most major [[media market|television market]]s in the early 1980s.\n\nThis evolved into today's many cable-only broadcasts of diverse programming, including cable-only produced [[television film|television movies]] and [[miniseries]].  Cable [[specialty channel]]s, starting with channels oriented to show movies and large sporting or performance events, diversified further, and \"[[narrowcasting]]\" became common.  By the late 1980s, cable-only signals outnumbered broadcast signals on cable systems, some of which by this time had expanded beyond 35 channels. By the mid-1980s in Canada, cable operators were allowed by the regulators to enter into distribution contracts with cable networks on their own.\n\nBy the 1990s, tiers became common, with customers able to subscribe to different tiers to obtain different selections of additional channels above the basic selection. By subscribing to additional tiers, customers could get specialty channels, movie channels, and foreign channels. Large cable companies used addressable descramblers to limit access to [[Pay television|premium channels]] for customers not subscribing to higher tiers, however the above magazines often published workarounds for that technology as well.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the pressure to accommodate the growing array of offerings resulted in digital transmission that made more efficient use of the VHF signal capacity; fibre optics was common to carry signals into areas near the home, where coax could carry higher frequencies over the short remaining distance. Although for a time in the 1980s and 1990s, television receivers and VCRs were equipped to receive the mid-band and super-band channels. Due to the fact that the descrambling circuitry was for a time present in these tuners, depriving the cable operator of much of their revenue, such [[cable-ready]] tuners are rarely used now - requiring a return to the [[set-top box]]es used from the 1970s onward.\n\nThe conversion to digital broadcasting has put all signals - broadcast and cable - into digital form, rendering analog cable television service mostly obsolete, functional in an ever-dwindling supply of select markets. Analog television sets are still{{when|date=November 2017}} accommodated, but their tuners are mostly obsolete, oftentimes dependent entirely on the set-top box.\n\n==Deployments by continent==\n{{main article|Cable television by region}}\nCable television is mostly available in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]], and less so in [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. Cable television has had little success in [[Africa]], as it is not cost-effective to lay cables in sparsely populated areas. So-called \"wireless cable\" or [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service|microwave]]-based systems are used instead.\n\n==Other cable-based services==\nCoaxial cables are capable of bi-directional carriage of signals as well as the transmission of large amounts of [[data]]. Cable television signals use only a portion of the bandwidth available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as [[cable internet]], [[cable telephony]] and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectrum. [[Broadband internet access]] is achieved over coaxial cable by using [[cable modem]]s to convert the [[television network|network]] data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog telephone modem to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 31.2k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.\n\nIn [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]], many cable operators have already introduced [[cable telephone]] service, which operates just like existing fixed line operators. This service involves installing a special telephone interface at the customer's premises that converts the analog signals from the customer's in-home wiring into a digital signal, which is then sent on the [[local loop]] (replacing the analog [[last mile]], or [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS)) to the company's switching center, where it is connected to the public switched telephone network ([[PSTN]]). The biggest obstacle to cable telephone service is the need for nearly 100% reliable service for emergency calls. One of the standards available for digital cable telephony, [[PacketCable]], seems to be the most promising and able to work with the [[Quality of Service|quality of service]] (QOS) demands of traditional analog [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) service. The biggest advantage to digital cable telephone service is similar to the advantage of digital cable, namely that data can be compressed, resulting in much less bandwidth used than a dedicated analog circuit-switched service. Other advantages include better voice quality and integration to a [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) network providing cheap or unlimited nationwide and international calling. In many cases, digital cable telephone service is separate from [[cable modem]] service being offered by many cable companies and does not rely on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) traffic or the Internet.\n\nTraditional cable television providers and traditional telecommunication companies increasingly compete in providing voice, video and data services to residences. The combination of television, telephone and Internet access is commonly called \"[[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]\", regardless of whether CATV or [[Telephone company|telcos]] offer it.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[AllVid]]\n* [[CableCARD]]\n* [[DOCSIS]]\n* [[DVB-C]]\n* [[European cable television frequencies]]\n* [[Multichannel video programming distributor]]\n* [[North American television frequencies]]\n* [[Private cable operator]]\n* [[QAM (television)]]\n* [[Satellite television]]\n* [[Switched video]]\n* [[Tru2way]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.rediffusion.info The history of Rediffusion by Gerald K Clode]\n* Eisenmann, Thomas R., [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/1591.html \"Cable TV: From Community Antennas to Wired Cities\"], ''[[Harvard Business School]] Weekly Newsletter'', July 10, 2000\n* Moss, Mitchell L.; Payne, Frances, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120410044646/http://www.mitchellmoss.com/articles/promise.html \"Can Cable Keep Its Promise?\"], ''New York Affairs'', Volume 6, Number 4.

A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name=\"bakerinstitute.org\" /> Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading.

When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a [[Volcanic crater|crater]], the feature is actually a type of [[sinkhole]], as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at [[B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga]] volcano in Iceland.<ref>Gudmundsson, M.T. et al. (2014) Graduale caldera collapse at B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano Iceland, regulated by lateral magma outflow, Science, 15.</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word comes from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{wiktes|caldera}}'', and [[Latin]] ''{{wiktla|caldaria}}'', meaning \"cooking pot\".  In some texts the English term ''cauldron'' is also used. The term ''caldera'' was introduced into the geological vocabulary by the German geologist [[Leopold von Buch]] when he published his memoirs of his 1815 visit to the [[Canary Islands]],{{refn|group=note|name=note 1|Leopold von Buch's book ''Physical Description of the Canary Isles'' was published in 1825}} where he first saw the Las Ca\u00f1adas caldera on [[Tenerife]], with Monta\u00f1a [[Teide]] dominating the landscape, and then the [[Caldera de Taburiente]] on [[La Palma]].\n\n==Caldera formation==\n[[File:Origin of volcanic caldera via analogue model.gif|thumb|left|Animation of analogue experiment showing origin of volcanic caldera in box filled with flour.]]\n[[File:Toba zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat]] image of [[Lake Toba]], on the island of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] (100 km/62 mi long and 30 km/19 mi wide, one of the world's largest calderas). A [[resurgent dome]] formed the island of [[Samosir]].]]\n\nA collapse is triggered by the emptying of the [[magma chamber]] beneath the volcano, sometimes as the result of a large explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]  (see [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|Tambora]]  in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on the flanks of a volcano (see [[Piton de la Fournaise]] in 2007) or in a connected fissure system (see [[B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga]] in 2014\u20132015). If enough [[magma]] is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]], the \"ring fault\", develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault [[intrusion]]s which are also known as [[Ring dike|ring dykes]]. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.\n\n===Mineralization===\nSome calderas are known to host rich [[ore deposit]]s. One of the world's best-preserved [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralized]] calderas is the [[Sturgeon Lake Caldera]] in [[northwestern Ontario]], Canada, which formed during the [[Neoarchean]] [[Era (geology)|era]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/prc/workshops/S08workshop.html |title=UMD: Precambrian Research Center |publisher=University of Minnesota, Duluth |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref> about 2,700 million years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanoes/calderas.html |title=Caldera Volcanoes |author= Ron Morton |publisher=University of Minnesota, Duluth |date=|accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n===Explosive caldera eruptions===\n{{Details|Explosive eruption}}\nIf the [[magma]] is rich in [[silica]], the caldera is often filled in with [[ignimbrite]], [[tuff]], [[rhyolite]], and other [[igneous rock]]s. Silica-rich magma has a high [[viscosity]], and therefore does not flow easily like [[basalt]]. As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the rapid off-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to decompress rapidly, thus triggering explosive destruction of the magma and spreading [[volcanic ash]] over wide areas. Further [[lava]] flows may be erupted.\n\nIf volcanic activity continues, the center of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a ''[[resurgent dome]]'' such as is seen at [[Gal\u00e1n|Cerro Gal\u00e1n]], [[Lake Toba]], [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]], etc., by subsequent intrusion of magma. A ''silicic'' or ''[[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] caldera'' may erupt hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event. Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as [[Krakatoa]] in 1883 or [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may have even greater effects.\n\nWhen Yellowstone Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> of material (as measured in dense rock equivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of [[North America]] in up to two metres of debris. By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in 1980, it released ~1.2&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (DRE) of ejecta. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]].\n\n====Toba====\n{{Main|Lake Toba|Toba catastrophe theory}}\n\nAbout 74,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about {{convert|2800|km3}} [[dense-rock equivalent]] of ejecta. This was the largest known eruption during the ongoing [[Quaternary]] period (the last 2.6&nbsp;million years) and the largest known explosive eruption during the last 25&nbsp;million years. In the late 1990s, [[anthropologist]] Stanley Ambrose<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/ambrose | title=Stanley Ambrose page | publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> proposed that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about 2,000\u201320,000 individuals, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]]. More recently, [[Lynn Jorde]] and [[Henry Harpending]] proposed that the human species was reduced to approximately 5,000-10,000 people.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000</ref> There is no direct evidence, however, that either theory is correct, and there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Gathorne-Hardy | first1=F.

The magma feeding these volcanoes is [[basalt]], which is silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less [[Viscosity|viscous]] than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano, and the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence calderas and can form more gradually than explosive calderas.

The craters of the moon have been well preserved through time and were once thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but actually were formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in the first few hundred million years after the Moon formed. Around 500&nbsp;million years afterward, the Moon's mantle was able to be extensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive basaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact craters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir at the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same morphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to form.<ref name = \"Wilson\"/> Although caldera-like structures are rare on the Moon, they are not completely absent.

The surfaces are dominated by lava flows, and all have one or more collapse calderas.<ref name = \"Wilson\"/> Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System, [[Olympus Mons]], which is more than three times the height of Mount Everest, with a diameter of 520&nbsp;km (323 miles).

This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are large [[shield volcano]]es that range in size from 150\u2013400&nbsp;km in diameter and 2\u20134&nbsp;km high.

Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004]], the first [[microprocessor]], was developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]]. They later became used commonly within the [[petroleum industry]] (oil and gas).\n\nModern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, [[ISO/IEC 7810|credit-card-sized]] models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of [[integrated circuit]]s reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.\n\nComputer [[operating system]]s as far back as [[Ancient UNIX|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator [[Computer program|programs]] such as [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.\n\nIn addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which include [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. {{As of|2016}}, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.\n\nIn 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this diminished to less than 0.05%.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The World\u2019s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila L\u00f3pez (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60\u201365; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html \"free access to the study\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414233810/http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html/ |date=2016-04-14 }}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents]]\n\n===Input===\n[[Electronics|Electronic]] calculators contain a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] with [[Push-button|buttons]] for [[Numerical digit|digit]]s and [[arithmetic]]al operations; some even contain \"00\" and \"000\" buttons to make larger or smaller [[number]]s easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with [[key combination]]s.\n\n===Display output===\nCalculators usually have [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD) as output in place of historical [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD); details are provided in the section ''[[#Technical improvements|Technical improvements]]''.\n\nLarge-sized [[Number|figures]] are often used to improve readability; while using [[decimal separator]] (usually a point rather than a [[comma]]) instead of or in addition to [[vulgar fraction]]s. Various symbols for [[Command (computing)|function commands]] may also be shown on the display. [[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractions]] such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal [[approximation]]s, for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some fractions (such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}}, which is {{math|0.14285714285714}}; to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in [[decimal]] form; as a result, many [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or [[mixed number]]s.\n\n===Memory===\nCalculators also have the ability to store numbers into [[computer memory]]. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. The variables can also be used for constructing [[formula]]s. Some models have the ability to extend [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity to store more numbers; the extended [[memory address]] is termed an [[array data structure|array]] index.\n\n===Power source===\nPower sources of calculators are: [[electric battery|batteries]], [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cells]] or [[mains electricity]] (for old models), turning on with a [[switch]] or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering [[solar cell]] exposure, or closing their [[lid]]). [[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.\n\n===Key layout===\nThe following keys are common to most pocket calculators.  While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.\n\n{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Usual basic pocket calculator layout\n| MC || MR || M\u2212 || M+\n|-\n| C || \u00b1 || % || \u221a\n|-\n| 7 || 8 || 9 || \u00f7\n|-\n| 4 || 5 || 6 || \u00d7\n|-\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || \u2212\n|-\n| 0 || . || = || +\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| MC or CM || '''M'''emory '''C'''lear\n|-\n| MR, RM, or MRC || '''M'''emory '''R'''ecall\n|-\n| M\u2212 || '''M'''emory '''Subtraction'''\n|-\n| M+ || '''M'''emory '''Addition'''\n|-\n| C or AC || '''A'''ll '''C'''lear\n|-\n| CE || '''C'''lear (last) '''E'''ntry; sometimes called CE/C: a first press clears the last entry (CE), a second press clears all (C)\n|-\n| \u00b1 or CHS || Toggle positive/negative number aka '''CH'''ange '''S'''ign\n|-\n| % || [[Percentage|Percent]]\n|-\n| \u00f7 || [[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n|-\n| \u00d7 || [[Multiplication]]\n|-\n| \u2212 || [[Subtraction]]\n|-\n| + || [[Addition]]\n|-\n| . || [[Decimal separator|Decimal point]]\n|-\n| \u221a || [[Square root]]\n|-\n| = || Result\n|}\n|}\n\n==Internal workings==\nIn general, a basic [[Electronics|electronic]] calculator consists of the following components:<ref>John Lewis, ''The Pocket Calculator Book''.

[[Liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFDs), and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays use [[Seven-segment display|seven segments]] to represent each [[Numerical digit|digit]] in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use [[dot matrix]] displays.\n** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.\n* Processor [[Chipset|chip]] ([[microprocessor]] or [[central processing unit]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Processor chip's contents\n!Unit \n!Function \n|- \n|Scanning ([[Polling (computer science)|Polling]]) unit \n|When a calculator is powered on, it scans the [[keypad]] waiting to pick up an [[Signal|electrical signal]] when a key is pressed.\n|- \n|[[Encoder]] unit \n|Converts the [[number]]s and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] into [[binary code]]. \n|- \n|X [[Processor register|register]] and Y register \n|They are number stores where numbers are stored temporarily while doing calculations.

It is used as an indicator of the processor's speed, and is measured in ''clock cycles per second'' or the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]]. For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred [[hertz]] to the [[kilohertz]] range.\n[[File:Tischrechner Walther ETR2034S resized.jpg|thumb|upright|An office calculating machine with a paper printer]]\n\n===Example===\nA basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:\n\nTo perform the calculation {{nowrap|25 + 9}}, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: {{key press|2}}&nbsp;{{key press|5}}&nbsp;{{key press|+}}&nbsp;{{key press|9}}&nbsp;{{key press|{{=}}}}.\n\n:* When {{key press|2}}&nbsp;{{key press|5}} is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;\n:* Next, when the {{key press|+}} key is pressed, the \"[[addition]]\" instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or [[status register]];\n:* The second number {{Key press|9}} is encoded and sent to the X register. This \"pushes\" (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;\n:* When the {{key press|{{=}}}} key is pressed, a \"message\" (signal) from the flag or [[status register]] tells the permanent or [[non-volatile memory]] that the operation to be done is \"[[addition]]\";\n:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;\n:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the [[binary decoder]] unit into a decimal number (usually [[binary-coded decimal]]), and then shown on the display panel.\n\nOther functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.\n\n====Numeric representation====\n{{Main|Binary-coded decimal}}\n\nMost pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD rather than a [[floating-point representation]].  BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235832/http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\nWhere calculators have added functions (such as square root, or [[trigonometric functions]]), software [[algorithm]]s are required to produce high precision results.

The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as [[programmable calculator]]s have [[Computer programming|programming]] functions, sometimes with support for [[programming language]]s (such as [[RPL (programming language)|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]]).\n\nFor instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[read-only memory]] (ROM), and compute [[trigonometric function]]s with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. [[Serial communication|Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[Parallel communication|bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes [[chipset|chip]] complexity, but takes many more [[clock signal|clock cycles]]. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], [[Motorola 68000|MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors to the electronic calculator===\n{{Main|Mechanical calculator}}\n{{See also|Human computer}}\n\nThe first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles, and [[counting board]]s, and the [[abacus]], known to have been used by [[Sumer]]ians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] before 2000&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}</ref> Except for the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (an \"out of the time\" [[Astronomy|astronomical]] device), development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the [[Sector (instrument)|geometric-military compass]] (by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]), [[logarithm]]s and [[Napier bones]] (by [[John Napier|Napier]]), and the [[slide rule]] (by [[Edmund Gunter]]).\n\n[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators.jpg|thumb|17th century mechanical calculators]]\nIn 1642, the [[Renaissance]] saw the invention of the [[mechanical calculator]] (by [[Wilhelm Schickard]]<ref>See for example, http://calculatorhistory.net</ref> and several decades later [[Blaise Pascal]]<ref>Pascal's invention of the [[calculating machine]]. Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....<br>\nIn a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.

This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.\n\n===Development of electronic calculators===\nThe first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.\n\nThe [[Casio]] Computer Company, in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.\n[[File:LED DISP.JPG|thumb|Early calculator [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) display from the 1970s ([[USSR]])]]\n\nIn October 1961, the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.<ref>\"Simple and Silent\", ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244</ref><ref>\"'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat\" [trans: \"the first portable electronic computer\"], ''B\u00fcromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207</ref> This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|\"Nixie\"]] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly {{convert|33|lb|kg}} due to its large tube system.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Guy|last2=Flamm|first2=Bruce|title=The History of Pocket Electronic Calculators|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|website=vintagecalculators.com|publisher=[[Vintage Calculators Web Museum]]|access-date=8 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703140814/http://vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|archivedate=3 July 2014|df=}}</ref> Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names \"Plus\" and \"Sumlock\", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.\n\nThe tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and introduced [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed {{convert|25|kg|lb}} and cost 500,000 yen (${{To USD|500000|JPN}}), and [[Industria Macchine Elettroniche]] of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).\n\n[[File:Olivetti Programma 101 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|The Italian [[Programma 101]], the first commercial programmable desktop computer, produced by [[Olivetti]] in 1964]]\n\nThere followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Mathatronics]], [[Olivetti]], [[SCM Corporation|SCM]] (Smith-Corona-Marchant), [[Sony]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]]. The early calculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba \"Toscal\" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.\n\nThe [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop '''electronic calculating machine''' programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.\n\n[[File:Elka-22 (I197211).png|thumb|left|The Bulgarian [[ELKA 22]] from 1965]]\nAnother calculator introduced in 1965 was [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria's]] [[ELKA#ELKA 6521|ELKA 6521]],<ref name=\"elka\">[http://clockwiser.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/elka-hist/ The Bulgarian ELKA electronic calculators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023023224/http://clockwiser.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/elka-hist/ |date=2013-10-23 }}, ''Clockwiser''.

A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.\n\n{{anchor|Cal Tech}}The first handheld calculator was a prototype called \"Cal Tech\", whose development was led by [[Jack Kilby]] at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1967.

There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuit]]s (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in [[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|large scale integration]] (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hayakawa Electric]] (later renamed [[Sharp Corporation]]) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed [[Rockwell International]]), [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].\n\n====Pocket calculators====\n{{Redirect|Pocket calculator|the song|Computer World}}\n\nBy 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 \"Mini Calculator\", the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp QT-8B]] \"micro Compet\". The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the \"Cal-Tech\" project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the \"Cal-Tech\" project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.\n\nSharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for US $395.\n\nHowever, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first \"calculator on a chip\", the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],<ref>\"Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line\", ''Electronics'', February 1, 1971, p19</ref> followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.\n\nIn 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro |title=Microprocessor History |publisher=Spingal.plus.com |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142104/http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro/ |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref> and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.\n\nThe first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A \"HANDY\", which was marketed early in 1971.<ref>\"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning\", Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.</ref> Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a \"calculator on a chip\"), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries.

Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like \"8 plus 5\" is, using RPN, performed by pressing {{key top|8}}, {{key top|Enter\u2191}}, {{key top|5}}, and {{key top|+}}; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: {{key top|8}}, {{key top|+}}, {{key top|5}}, {{key top|{{=}}}}. It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.\n\nThe first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the \"B3-18\" was completed by the end of 1975.\n\nIn 1973, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) introduced the [[TI SR-10|SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the [[TI SR-11|SR-11]] featured an added key for entering [[Pi]] (\u03c0). It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.\n\nIn 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]] arose which focused on specialized markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |title=The Loan Arranger II |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719134735/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}</ref> (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values.

These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''[[continuous memory]]'', i.e., programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory]] (RAM, for memory) and [[read-only memory]] (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).\n\nThe first Soviet programmable desktop calculator [[ISKRA 123]], powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] ''[[B3-21]]'', was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051719/http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |archive-date=2017-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.\n\nThis series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to \"[[synthetic programming]]\" of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine ''[[Nauka i Zhizn]]'' (''\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c'', ''Science and Life''), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named \"[[yeggogology]]\" (\"\u0435\u0433\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f\"). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word \"YEGGOG\" (\"\u0415\u0413\u0413\u041e\u0413\") which, unsurprisingly, is translated to \"Error\".\n\nA similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].\n\n====Technical improvements====\n[[File:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power]]\nThrough the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A \"HANDY\"'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (a.k.a. ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form using the ''Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM'' with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.\n\nA more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's ''Calculator On Substrate'' (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.\n\n[[File:Braun 4856 solar card calculator, 2.jpg|thumb|Credit-card-sized, solar-powered calculator by [[Braun (company)|Braun]] (1987)]]\nIn the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, ''twisted nematic'' (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.\n\nThere were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first \"calculator on a chip\" [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.\n\nThe power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp \"EL-801\" in 1972, the [[transistor]]s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.\n\nWith this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cell]]s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:CasioFX20-inside.jpg|The interior of a Casio fx-20 scientific calculator from the mid-1970s, using a VFD.

This calculator uses a battery pack as a power source.\nFile:Sharp el-323 ic 1ae.jpg|The processor chip (integrated circuit package) inside a 1981 Sharp pocket calculator, marked SC6762 1\u2022H.

The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.\n\nBy 1976, the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Mid-1980s to present===\n[[File:Elektronika MK-52.JPG|thumb|The [[Elektronika MK-52]] was a programmable RPN-style calculator that accepted extension modules; it was manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1985 to 1992]]\nThe first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the [[HP-28C]], released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio fx-7000G]] released in 1985.\n\nThe two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.\n\nThe [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the \"HP 12c platinum edition\" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.\n\n[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the \u201cI\u201d, \u201cPV\u201d, \u201cFV\u201d to easier labeling terms such as \"Int\", \"Term\", \"Pmt\", and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman,<ref>{{cite web |author=Mark Bollman |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |title=Mark->'s Calculator Collection |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135244/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}</ref> a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the \"Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators\" which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.\n\nPersonal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDAs) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.\n\n==Use in education==\nIn most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or [[elementary arithmetic]] skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations ''in the head'', with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[Approximation|estimation]] methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.<ref>{{Cite journal|authors=Thomas J. Bing, Edward F.

Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines.\n\nSince the registration is done with the process of returning change, according to [[Bill Bryson]]<ref name=\"Bryson\">{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Bryson |title=Made in America: An Informal History of the English Language in the United States |pages= 114\u2013115 |isbn=978-0380713813 |publisher=William Morrow Paperbacks |year=1994}}</ref> [[odd pricing]] came about because by charging odd amounts like 49 and 99 cents (or 45 and 95 cents when [[nickels]] are more used than [[pennies]]), the cashier very probably had to open the till for the penny change and thus announce the sale.\n\n[[File:Cash register, built 1904 in Ohio.jpg|thumb|left|[[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]] expressly built for a merchant in [[Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto nad Metuj\u00ed]], Austro-Hungary, 1904]]\nShortly after the patent, Ritty became overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]] Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the [[General journal|journal]] for internal [[bookkeeping]] purposes, and the [[receipt]] for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection.

These POS terminals will often also identify the cashier on the receipt, and carry additional information or offers.\n\nCurrently, many cash registers are individual computers. They may be running traditionally in-house software or general purpose software such as [[DOS]]. Many of the newer ones have touch screens. They may be connected to computerized [[point of sale]] networks using any type of protocol. Such systems may be accessed remotely for the purpose of obtaining records or troubleshooting. Many businesses also use [[tablet computer]]s as cash registers, utilizing the sale system as downloadable app-software.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/21/ipads-and-other-tablets-transforming-cash-register/51erCu8o01D2m4AMmTIUJN/story.html|date=April 22, 2013|work= The New York Times|title=Tablets transforming the cash register|first=Nick |last= Wingfield}}</ref>\n\n===Cash drawer===\n[[File:Old Cdn general store register.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Old Canadian general store shopping register model, City of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] Museum, [[British Columbia]], Canada]]Cash registers include a key labeled \"No Sale\", abbreviated \"NS\" on many modern electronic cash registers. Its function is to open the drawer, printing a receipt stating \"No Sale\" and recording in the register log that the register was opened. Some cash registers require a numeric password or physical key to be used when attempting to open the till.\n\nA cash register's drawer can only be opened by an instruction from the cash register except when using special [[key (lock)|keys]], generally held by the owner and some employees (e.g. manager). This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks of an employee [[Theft|taking money from the drawer]] without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but still has to be given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than [[inventory]]).\n\nA cash drawer is usually a compartment underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer typically contains a removable till. The till is usually a plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately in order to make counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits. Some modern cash drawers are individual units separate from the rest of the cash register.\n\nA cash drawer is usually of strong construction and may be integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides in and out of its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer.\nCash drawers that are integral to a stand-alone register often have a manual release catch underneath to open the drawer in the event of a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the \"locked\" position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.\n\nDue to the increasing number of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers are designed to store notes upright & facing forward, instead of the traditional flat & facing upright position. This enables faster access to each note and allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Sometimes the cashier will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are flip top in design, where they flip open instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcs-technology.com/cash_drawers.html |title=Cash Drawers |publisher=PCS Technology Ltd |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Manual input===\nRegisters will typically feature a numerical pad, [[QWERTY]] or custom keyboard, touch screen interface, or a combination of these input methods for the cashier to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale. For older registers as well as at restaurants and other establishments that do not sell barcoded items, the manual input may be the only method of interacting with the register. While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.\n\n===Scanner===\nModern cash registers may be connected to a handheld or stationary [[barcode reader]] so that a customer's purchases can be more rapidly scanned than would be possible by keying numbers into the register by hand. The use of scanners should also help prevent errors that result from manually entering the product's barcode or pricing. At grocers, the register's scanner may be combined with a scale for measuring product that is sold by weight.\n\n===Receipt printer===\nCashiers are often required to provide a receipt to the customer after a purchase has been made. Registers typically use [[thermal printing|thermal printers]] to print receipts, although older [[Dot matrix printing|dot matrix printers]] are still in use at some retailers. Alternatively, retailers can forgo issuing paper receipts in some jurisdictions by instead asking the customer for an email to which their receipt can be sent. The receipts of larger retailers tend to include unique barcodes or other information identifying the transaction so that the receipt can be scanned to facilitate returns or other customer services.\n\n===Security deactivation===\nIn stores that use [[electronic article surveillance]], a pad or other surface will be attached to the register that deactivates security devices embedded in or attached to the items being purchased. This will prevent a customer's purchase from setting off security alarms at the store's exit.\n\n==Self-service cash register==\n[[File:HomeDepotPinOakHoustonselfcheckout.jpg|thumb|Self-checkout machine at [[Home Depot]] store, Pin Oak, [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]\n{{Main|Self checkout}}\nSome corporations and [[supermarket]]s have introduced self-checkout machines, where the customer is trusted to scan the [[barcode]]s (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www-03.ibm.com/products/retail/products/self/sco/index.html |title= IBM Self Checkout Systems |publisher= [[IBM]]}}</ref> The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag does not match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines' weaknesses (for example, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by [[debit card]]/[[credit card]], or cash via coin slot and [[Bill validator|bank note scanner]]. Store employees are also needed to authorize \"age-restricted\" purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or by means of a \"store login\" which the operator has to enter.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Credit card terminal]]\n*[[EFTPOS]]\n*[[Point of sale]]\n*[[Point of sale display]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refs|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cash Register}}\n[[Category:Retailing]]\n[[Category:1884 introductions]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Cash]]", "sha1": "pgsltgxom6lb77osmmq8mcibcbwj435"}}, {"title": "Chronometer", "ns": "0", "id": "7595", "revision": {"id": "832971958", "parentid": "832971900", "timestamp": "2018-03-28T23:51:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ibadibam", "id": "1138432"}, "comment": "/* See also */ +[[Chronograph]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|chronometer|chronoscope}}\n'''Chronometer''' or '''chronoscope''' may refer to:\n* [[Chronometer of Loulie]], a precursor to the metronome\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Chronometer watch]]\n* [[Observatory chronometer]], a device certified by an observatory to be extremely accurate\n* [[Marine chronometer]], a timekeeper used for marine navigation\n* [[Railroad chronometer]], a specialized timepiece once used for safe operation of trains\n* Chronoscope or [[time viewer]], a fictional, oracle-like device occasionally employed in science fiction\n* ''[[Longines Chronoscope]]'', an American television program (1951\u20131955)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chronometry]], the science of timekeeping\n* [[Hydrochronometer]], a water clock\n* [[Chronograph]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "dj6wjzxw470ujpvkes602rc7gulcr7w"}}, {"title": "Processor design", "ns": "0", "id": "7597", "revision": {"id": "863768398", "parentid": "839545805", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T21:53:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Alexander Davronov", "id": "33011235"}, "comment": "/* Details */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Expert needed|Electronics|date=March 2012}}\n'''Processor design''' is the [[design engineer]]ing task of creating a [[processor (computing)|processor]], a component of [[computer hardware]]. It is a subfield of [[computer engineering]] (design, development and implementation) and [[electronics engineering]] (fabrication). The design process involves choosing an [[instruction set]] and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] or [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]]) and results in a [[microarchitecture]], which might be described in e.g. [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]]. For [[microprocessor]] design, this description is then manufactured employing some of the various [[semiconductor device fabrication]] processes, resulting in a [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] which is bonded onto a [[chip carrier]]. This chip carrier is then soldered onto, or inserted into a [[CPU socket|socket]] on, a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB).\n\nThe mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using [[Processor register|registers]], change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control program flow.\n\n== Details ==\n{{Prose|section|date=May 2011}}\n\n=== Basics ===\nCPU design is divided into design of the following components:\n\n# [[datapath]]s (such as [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]])\n# [[control unit]]: logic which controls the datapaths\n# [[Memory (computing)|Memory]] components such as [[register file]]s, [[cache memory|cache]]s\n# [[Clock signal|Clock]] circuitry such as clock drivers, [[Phase-locked loop|PLLs]], [[clock distribution network]]s\n# Pad transceiver circuitry\n# [[Logic gate]] cell [[Library (electronics)|library]] which is used to implement the logic\n\nCPUs designed for high-performance markets might require custom (optimized or application specific (see below)) designs for each of these items to achieve frequency, [[power consumption|power-dissipation]], and chip-area goals whereas CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as [[intellectual property]]. Control logic implementation techniques ([[logic synthesis]] using CAD tools) can be used to implement datapaths, register files, and clocks. Common logic styles used in CPU design include unstructured random logic, [[finite-state machine]]s, [[microprogramming]] (common from 1965 to 1985), and [[Programmable logic array]]s (common in the 1980s, no longer common).\n\n=== Implementation logic ===\nDevice types used to implement the logic include:\n* [[Transistor-transistor logic]] [[Small Scale Integration]] logic chips - no longer used for CPUs\n* [[Programmable Array Logic]] and [[Programmable logic device]]s - no longer used for CPUs\n* [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) [[gate array]]s - no longer common\n\n*[[CMOS]] [[gate array]]s - no longer used for CPUs\n\n*[[CMOS]] [[Integrated circuit|mass-produced IC]]s - the vast majority of CPUs by volume\n*[[CMOS]] [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s - only for a minority of special applications due to expense\n*[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) - common for [[soft microprocessor]]s, and more or less required for [[reconfigurable computing]]\n\nA CPU design project generally has these major tasks:\n* Programmer-visible [[instruction set architecture]], which can be implemented by a variety of [[microarchitecture]]s\n* Architectural study and performance modeling in [[ANSI C]]/[[C++]] or [[SystemC]]{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n* [[High-level synthesis]] (HLS) or [[register transfer level]] (RTL, e.g. logic) implementation\n* RTL verification\n* [[Circuit design]] of speed critical components (caches, registers, ALUs)\n* [[Logic synthesis]] or logic-gate-level design\n* [[Static timing analysis|Timing analysis]] to confirm that all logic and circuits will run at the specified operating frequency\n* Physical design including [[Floorplan (microelectronics)#Floorplanning|floorplanning]], [[place and route]] of logic gates\n* Checking that RTL, gate-level, transistor-level and physical-level representations are equivalent\n* Checks for [[signal integrity]], [[design rule checking|chip manufacturability]]\n\nRe-designing a CPU core to a smaller die-area helps to shrink everything (a \"[[photomask]] shrink\"), resulting in the same number of transistors on a smaller die. It improves performance (smaller transistors switch faster), reduces power (smaller wires have less [[parasitic capacitance]]) and reduces cost (more CPUs fit on the same wafer of silicon). Releasing a CPU on the same size die, but with a smaller CPU core, keeps the cost about the same but allows higher levels of integration within one [[very-large-scale integration]] chip (additional cache, multiple CPUs or other components), improving performance and reducing overall system cost.\n\nAs with most complex electronic designs, the [[functional verification|logic verification]] effort (proving that the design does\nnot have bugs) now dominates the project schedule of a CPU.\n\nKey CPU architectural innovations include [[index register]], [[CPU cache|cache]], [[virtual memory]], [[instruction pipelining]], [[superscalar]], [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]], [[virtual machine]], [[emulator]]s, [[microprogram]], and [[Stack (data structure)|stack]].\n\n=== Micro-architectural concepts ===\n{{Main|Microarchitecture}}\n\n=== Research topics ===\n<!-- [[virtual memory]] moved to [[Computer architecture]] -->\n{{Main|History of general-purpose CPUs#1990 to today: looking forward}}\n\nA variety of [[History of general-purpose CPUs#1990 to today: looking forward|new CPU design ideas]] have been proposed,\nincluding [[reconfigurable logic]], [[clockless CPU]]s, [[computational RAM]], and [[optical computing]].\n\n===Performance analysis and benchmarking===\n{{Main| Computer performance}}\n[[benchmark (computing)|Benchmarking]] is a way of testing CPU speed. Examples include SPECint and [[SPECfp]], developed by [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]], and [[ConsumerMark]] developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium [[EEMBC]].\n\nSome of the commonly used metrics include:\n* [[Instructions per second]] - Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normally [[Intel]] [[IA32]] architecture) to be able to run a large base of pre-existing pre-compiled software.  Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks,  some of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency (see [[Megahertz Myth]]).\n* [[FLOPS]] - The number of floating point operations per second is often important in selecting computers for scientific computations.\n* [[Performance per watt]] - System designers building [[parallel computing|parallel computers]], such as [[Google search technology#Current hardware|Google]], pick CPUs based on their speed per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM|title=EEMBC ConsumerMark|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050327005323/http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM |archivedate=March 27, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/power-could-cost-more-than-servers-google-warns/|title=Power could cost more than servers, Google warns|author=Stephen Shankland|date=December 9, 2005}}</ref>\n* Some system designers building parallel computers pick CPUs based on the speed per dollar.\n* System designers building [[real-time computing]] systems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has low [[interrupt latency]] and when it has deterministic response. ([[Digital signal processor|DSP]])\n* Computer programmers who program directly in assembly language want a CPU to support a full featured [[instruction set]].\n* Low power - For systems with limited power sources (e.g. solar, batteries, human power).\n* Small size or low weight - for portable embedded systems, systems for spacecraft.\n* Environmental impact - Minimizing environmental impact of computers during manufacturing and recycling as well during use.  Reducing waste, reducing hazardous materials.  (see [[Green computing]]).  <!-- ... Are there other measures of \"goodness\", \"figures of merit\", that I'm missing here? -->\n\nThere may be tradeoffs in optimizing some of these metrics.  In particular, many design techniques that make a CPU run faster make the \"performance per watt\", \"performance per dollar\", and \"deterministic response\" much worse, and vice versa.\n\n==Markets==\nThere are several different markets in which CPUs are used. Since each of these markets differ in their requirements for CPUs, the devices designed for one market are in most cases inappropriate for the other markets.\n\n===General purpose computing===\nThe vast majority of revenues generated from CPU sales is for general purpose computing{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, that is, desktop, laptop, and server computers commonly used in businesses and homes. In this market, the Intel [[IA-32]] and the 64-bit version [[x86-64]] architecture dominate the market, with its rivals [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]] maintaining much smaller customer bases. Yearly, hundreds of millions of IA-32 architecture CPUs are used by this market.  A growing percentage of these processors are for mobile implementations such as netbooks and laptops.<ref>Kerr, Justin.

Published 2010-10-26.</ref>\n\nSince these devices are used to run countless different types of programs, these CPU designs are not specifically targeted at one type of application or one function. The demands of being able to run a wide range of programs efficiently has made these CPU designs among the more advanced technically, along with some disadvantages of being relatively costly, and having high power consumption.\n\n====High-end processor economics====\nIn 1984, most high-performance CPUs required four to five years to develop.<ref>\n\"New system manages hundreds of transactions per second\" article\nby Robert Horst and Sandra Metz, of Tandem Computers Inc.,\n\"Electronics\" magazine, 1984 April 19:\n\"While most high-performance CPUs require four to five years to develop,\nThe [[NonStop]] TXP processor took just 2+1/2 years --\nsix months to develop a complete written specification,\none year to construct a working prototype,\nand another year to reach volume production.\"\n</ref>\n\n===Scientific computing===\n{{Main|Supercomputer}}\nScientific computing is a much smaller niche market (in revenue and units shipped).  It is used in government research labs and universities. Before 1990, CPU design was often done for this market, but mass market CPUs organized into large clusters have proven to be more affordable. The main remaining area of active hardware design and research for scientific computing is for high-speed data transmission systems to connect mass market CPUs.\n\n=== Embedded design ===\n{{Main|Embedded system}}\nAs measured by units shipped, most CPUs are embedded in other machinery, such as telephones, clocks, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure. Embedded processors sell in the volume of many billions of units per year, however, mostly at much lower price points than that of the general purpose processors.\n\nThese single-function devices differ from the more familiar general-purpose CPUs in several ways:\n* Low cost is of high importance.\n* It is important to maintain a low power dissipation as embedded devices often have a limited battery life and it is often impractical to include cooling fans.<ref>S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]\", IJCAET, 6(4), 440\u2013459, 2014.</ref>\n* To give lower system cost, peripherals are integrated with the processor on the same silicon chip.\n* Keeping peripherals on-chip also reduces power consumption as external GPIO ports typically require buffering so that they can source or sink the relatively high current loads that are required to maintain a strong signal outside of the chip.\n** Many embedded applications have a limited amount of physical space for circuitry; keeping peripherals on-chip will reduce the space required for the circuit board.\n** The program and data memories are often integrated on the same chip. When the only allowed program memory is [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the device is known as a [[microcontroller]].\n* For many embedded applications, interrupt latency will be more critical than in some general-purpose processors.\n\n====Embedded processor economics====\nThe embedded CPU family with the largest number of total units shipped is the [[8051]], averaging nearly a billion units per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.wallawalla.edu/~curt.nelson/engr355/lecture/8051_overview.pdf |title=8051 Overview |author=Curtis A.

The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. [[Ratite]]s, all of which are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ''ratis'', \"raft\", referring to the flatness of the sternum). The difficulty with this scheme [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] was that some flightless birds, without strong keels, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds possessing one. Examples include the [[kakapo]], a flightless [[parrot]], and the [[dodo]], a columbiform (the [[pigeon]] family). None of these birds is a ratite. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Carinatae was given several [[phylogenetic]] definitions. The first was as a node-based [[clade]] uniting ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' with modern birds.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cracraft |first=Joel |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=The origin and early diversification of birds |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=383\u2013399 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> However, in many analyses, this definition would be synonymous with the more widely used name [[Ornithurae]]. An alternate definition was provided in 2001, naming Carinatae an [[apomorphy]]-based clade defined by the presence of a keeled sternum.<ref name=gauhthier2001>Gauthier, J., & De Queiroz, K. (2001).

The head of the Church and the [[Apostolic see|See]] of [[Alexandria]] is the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria on the Holy See of Saint Mark]], who also carries the title of Coptic Pope. The See of Alexandria is titular, and today the Coptic Pope presides from [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in the [[Abbassia]] District in [[Cairo]]. The church follows the [[Alexandrian Rite]] for its liturgy, prayer and devotional patrimony. With 18\u201322 million members worldwide, whereof about 15 to 18 million are in Egypt (see Demographics section below), it is the country's largest Christian church.\n\nAccording to its tradition, the Coptic Church was established by [[St. Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]], an [[Apostles|apostle]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]], during the middle of the 1st century (c. 42 AD).<ref name=\"Church History p28\">[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that Saint Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 A.D. {{cite book|author=Otto Friedrich August Meinardus|title=Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmey73GtfuUC|year=2002|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-424-757-6|page=28}}</ref> Due to disputes concerning the [[Hypostatic Union|nature of Christ]], it split from the rest of the Christendom after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD&nbsp;451, resulting in a rivalry with the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa|Byzantine Orthodox Church]]. In the 4-7th centuries the Coptic Church gradually expanded due to the [[Christianization]] of the [[Aksumite Kingdom|Aksumite empire]] and of two of the three [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdoms, [[Nobatia]] and [[Alodia]], while the third Nubian kingdom, [[Makuria]], recognized the Coptic patriarch after initially being aligned to the Byzantine Orthodox Church.\n\nAfter 639 A.D. Egypt was ruled by its [[Islam]]ic conquerors from [[Arabia]], and the treatment of the Coptic Christians ranged from tolerance to open persecution. In the 12th century, the church relocated its seat from Alexandria to Cairo. The same century also saw the Copts became a religious minority. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Nubian Christianity was supplanted by Islam.\n\nIn 1959, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted [[autocephaly]] or independence. This was extended to the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] in 1998 following the successful [[Eritrean War of Independence]] from [[Ethiopia]]. \n\nSince the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Arab Spring in 2011]], the Copts have been suffering increased religion-based discrimination and violence.<ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/09/middleeast/egypt-coptic-christians/index.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Oriental Orthodox sidebar}}\n{{Copts}}\n\n===Apostolic foundation===\n\nThe Egyptian Church is traditionally believed to be founded by St Mark at around AD&nbsp;42, and regards itself as the subject of many [[prophecies]] in the [[Old Testament]]. [[Isaiah]] the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says \"In that day there will be an altar to the {{Lord}} in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the {{Lord}} at its border.\"<ref name=\"Church History p28\"/>\n\nThe first Christians in Egypt were common people who spoke Egyptian [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref name=\"ECM\">[http://home.att.net/~nathan.wilson/missionbios.html Early church missionary]</ref> There were also Alexandrian [[Jewish]] people such as [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], whom [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke the Evangelist]] addresses in the introductory chapter of his [[Gospel of Luke|gospel]]. When the church was founded by [[Saint Mark]] during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Nero]], a great multitude of native Egyptians (as opposed to [[Greeks]] or Jews) embraced the Christian faith.<ref name=\"ECM\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01300b.htm|title=The Church of Alexandria|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nChristianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of [[Saint Mark]]'s arrival in Alexandria, as is clear from the [[New Testament]] writings found in [[Oxyrhynchus|Bahnasa]], in Middle Egypt, which date around the year AD&nbsp;200, and a fragment of the [[Gospel of John]], written in Coptic, which was found in [[Upper Egypt]] and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local languages, namely Coptic.\n\n===Coptic Language in the Church===\nThe Coptic language is a universal language used in Coptic churches in every country. It is derived from ancient Egyptian and uses Greek letters. Many of the hymns in the liturgy are in Coptic and have been passed down for several thousand years. The language is used to preserve Egypt's original language, which was banned by the Arab invaders, who ordered Arabic to be used instead.<ref>http://www.copts-united.com/Article.php?I=3283&A=365617</ref> Some examples of these hymns are Epooro, Ekesmar'oot, Tai Shori, and many more.\n\n===Contributions to Christianity===\n\n==== Catechetical School of Alexandria====\nThe [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] is the oldest catechetical school in the world. St. [[Jerome]] records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Saint Mark himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter1.html |title=The School of Alexandria \u2013 Part I \u2013 An Introduction to the School of Alexandria |publisher=Copticchurch.net |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref> Around AD&nbsp;190 under the leadership of the scholar [[Pantanaeus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and the native Egyptian [[Origen]], who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies.\n\nMany scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before [[Braille]], wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.\n\nThe Theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893. The new school currently has campuses in Ireland, [[Cairo]], [[New Jersey]], and Los Angeles, where Coptic priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among other subjects Christian theology, history, the Coptic language and art \u2013 including chanting, music, [[iconography]], and tapestry.\n\n====Cradle of monasticism and its missionary work====\n{{Main|Coptic monasticism}}\nMany Egyptian Christians went to the desert during the 3rd century, and remained there to pray and work and dedicate their lives to seclusion and worship of God. This was the beginning of the [[Monasticism|monastic movement]], which was organized by [[Saint Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great]], [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul of Thebes]], the world's first [[anchorite]], [[Macarius the Great|Saint Macarius the Great]] and [[Pachomius|Saint Pachomius the Cenobite]] in the 4th century.\n\n[[Christian monasticism]] was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the Coptic Orthodox Church character of submission, simplicity and humility, thanks to the teachings and writings of the [[Desert Fathers|Great Fathers of Egypt's Deserts]]. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. A great number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations to this day.\n\nAll Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example: [[Saint Basil|Saint Basil the Great]] Archbishop of Caesaria of Cappadocia, founder and organizer of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around AD&nbsp;357 and his rule is followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches; Saint Jerome who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt, while en route to [[Jerusalem]], around AD&nbsp;400 and left details of his experiences in his letters; [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, but in a stricter form. Countless pilgrims have visited the \"Desert Fathers\" to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives.\n\n===Role and participation in the Ecumenical Councils===\n\n====Council of Nicaea====\n{{main|First Council of Nicaea}}\n\nIn the 4th century, an Alexandrian [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as [[Arianism]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea|Ecumenical Council of Nicea]] AD&nbsp;325 was convened by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] after the Pope [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander I of Alexandria]] request to hold a Council to respond to heresies,<ref>https://st-takla.org/Coptic-History/CopticHistory_02-History-of-the-Coptic-Church-Councils-n-Christian-Heresies/Encyclopedia-Coptica-History__005-Magma3-Nekia-325.html</ref> under the presidency of Saint [[Hosius of Cordova]] to resolve the dispute and eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the [[Nicene Creed]].<ref name=\"Carroll 1987 11\">{{harvnb|Carroll|1987|p=11}}</ref> The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was based largely on the teaching put forth by a man who eventually would become Pope Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the chief opponent of Arius.\n\n====Council of Constantinople====\n{{main|First Council of Constantinople}}\n\nIn the year AD&nbsp;381, Pope [[Timothy I of Alexandria]] presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]], to judge Macedonius, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed the [[Nicene Creed]] with this confirmation of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]]:\n\n<blockquote>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father through the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen.</blockquote>\n\n====Council of Ephesus====\n{{main|Council of Ephesus}}\n[[File:CopticAltar.jpg|thumb|left|Coptic Icon in the Coptic Altar of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nAnother theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of [[Nestorius]], the Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title \"Mother of God\" ''([[Theotokos]])'' to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], declaring her instead to be \"Mother of Christ\" ''[[Christotokos]]''.\n\nWhen reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark, Pope Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]] acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent. When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]], supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as \"The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.\" This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: \"The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.\" In these [[anathema]]s, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, \"Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' is Anathema!\" Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the [[First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus]] (431), over which Cyril presided.\n\nThe Council confirmed the teachings of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]] and confirmed the title of Mary as \"[[Mother of God]]\". It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Cyril had said that there is \"One Nature [and One Hypostasis] for God the Word Incarnate\" (''Mia Physis tou Theou Logou Sesark\u014dmen\u0113''). Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows:\n\n<blockquote>We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God ''(Theotokos)'' for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen. [not dissimilar to the \"[[Axion Estin]]\" Chant still used in Orthodoxy]</blockquote>\n\n====Council of Chalcedon====\n{{main|Council of Chalcedon}}\n\n[[File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]]]\nWhen in AD&nbsp;451, Emperor [[Marcian]] attempted to heal divisions in the Church, the response of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus]] \u2013 the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled \u2013 was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the Church. It was at [[Chalcedon]] that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness. In 449, Pope Dioscorus headed the 2nd Council of Ephesus, called the \"[[Robber Council]]\" by Chalcedonian historians. It held to the [[Miaphysite]] formula which upheld the Christology of \"One Incarnate Nature of God the Word\" ([[Byzantine Greek|Greek]]: \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 (''mia physis Theou Logou sesark\u014dmen\u0113'')),<ref>{{cite book|title=Apollinaris von Laodicea und seine Schule: Texte und Untersuchungen|author=Apollinaris of Laodicea|author-link=Apollinaris of Laodicea|editor-first=Hans|editor-last=Lietzmann|editor-link=Hans Lietzmann|year=1904|page=251|chapter=\u03a0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bf\u03b2\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/apollinarisvonl01apolgoog#page/n269/mode/2up|language=German, Greek|publisher=[[Mohr Siebeck Verlag]]}}</ref> and upheld the heretic [[Eutyches]] claiming he was [[orthodoxy|orthodox]].\n\nThe [[Council of Chalcedon]] summoned Dioscorus three times to appear at the council, after which he was deposed. The Council of Chalcedon further deposed him for his support of Eutyches, but not necessarily for Eutychian [[Monophysitism]]. Dioscorus appealed to the conciliar fathers to allow for a more [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] interpretation of Christology at the council, but was denied. Following his being deposed, the Coptic Church and its faithful felt unfairly underrepresented at the council and oppressed politically by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. After the Byzantines appointed [[Proterius of Alexandria]] as Patriarch to represent the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa|Chalcedonian Church]], the Coptic Church appointed their own Patriarch [[Timothy Aelurus]] and broke from the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian communion]].\n\nThe [[Council of Chalcedon]], from the perspective of the Alexandrine Christology, has deviated from the approved Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, \"Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary,\" thus the foundation of the definition according to the [[Non-Chalcedonianism|Non-Chalcedonian]] adherents, according to the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria is valid. There is a change in the Non-Chalcedonian definition here, as the Nicene creed clearly uses the terms \"of\", rather than \"in.\"\n\nIn terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is \"One Nature\u2014the Logos Incarnate,\" ''of'' the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians' understanding is that Christ is ''recognized in'' two natures, full humanity and full divinity. [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] contends that such a formulation is no different from what the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] teach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/mfignatius/others/byzantine01.html |title=Split of the Byzantine and Oriental Churches |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ko4JzKTH?url=http://www.geocities.com/mfignatius/others/byzantine01.html |archivedate=26 October 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> This is the doctrinal perception that makes the apparent difference which separated the Oriental Orthodox from the Eastern Orthodox.\n\nThe Council's findings were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the [[Byzantine Empire]], including Egyptians, [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriacs]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]], and others.\n\nFrom that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the [[List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria|Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark]], and the [[Melkite]] or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020603083958/http://www.greekorthodox-alexandria.org/ Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria].</ref>\n\nAlmost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria).<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}} See drop-down essay on \"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\"</ref> Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in [[Full communion|communion]] with the other leading imperial churches of [[History of the Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]]. The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria regards itself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. There was an opinion in the Church that viewed that perhaps the Council understood the Church of Alexandria correctly, but wanted to curtail the existing power of the Alexandrine Hierarch, especially after the events that happened several years before at Constantinople from [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]] towards Patriarch [[John Chrysostom]] and the unfortunate turnouts of the Second Council of Ephesus in AD&nbsp;449, where Eutichus misled Pope Dioscorus and the Council in confessing the Orthodox Faith in writing and then renouncing it after the Council, which in turn, had upset Rome, especially that the Tome which was sent was not read during the Council sessions.\n\nTo make things even worse, the Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was, according to the Alexandria School of Theology, particularly in regards to the definition of Christology, considered influenced by Nestorian heretical teachings. So, due to the above-mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, there would be an impasse and a scapegoat, i.e. Pope Dioscorus. The Tome of Leo has been widely criticized (surprisingly by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox scholars) in the past 50 years as a much less than perfect orthodox theological doctrine.\n\nIt is also to be noted that by anathemizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] in AD&nbsp;449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons.\n\nCopts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.<ref>Romanides, John S. [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm Leo of Rome's Support of Theodoret].</ref>\n\nBefore the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians \"[[Monophysitism|Monophysites]]\", though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards Monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as \"[[Dyophysitism|Dyophysite]]\".\n\nA term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]], which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\", which was reiterated by [[Cyril of Alexandria|Saint Cyril of Alexandria]].\n\nCopts, thus, believe in two natures \"human\" and \"divine\" that are united in one hypostasis \"without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration\". These two natures \"did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea).\n\n===From Chalcedon to the Arab conquest of Egypt===\nPrior to Chalcedon, the Imperial Church's main division stemmed from [[Nestorianism]], eventually leading the [[Church of the East]] to declare its independence in 424. After the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Coptic Church and its hierarchy felt suspicious of what they believed were [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] elements within the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Church]]. As a result, the anti-Chalcedon partisan, [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timotheos Aelurus]], consigned himself to depose the [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Chalcedonian Pope of Alexandria]], [[Proterius of Alexandria]], and to set himself up as the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] in opposition to the entire Chalcedonian Church of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Copts suffered under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The [[Melkite]] Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred those Egyptians they considered heretics. Many were tortured and martyred in attempts to force their acceptance of the Chalcedonian terms, but the Egyptians remained loyal to the Cyrillian [[Miaphysitism]]. One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of the period is [[Saint Samuel the Confessor]].\n\n===Muslim conquest of Egypt===\n[[File:Bischop of Faras.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Makuria]]n wall painting depicting a Nubian bishop and [[Virgin Mary]] (11th century)]]\nThe [[Muslim invasion of Egypt]] took place in AD&nbsp;639. Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, gradual conversions to [[Islam]] over the centuries had changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century.<ref>Kamil, Jill (1997).

Sometime during the 2nd Millennium AD, the leadership of the Church, including the Pope, moved from Alexandria to Cairo.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution===\nThe position of Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]]. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 the [[jizya]] tax was abolished. Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.<ref name=\"StGeorge\">{{cite web|url=http://suscopts.org/stgeorgedaytona/coptic_church.html |title=Saint George Coptic Church |publisher=Suscopts.org |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Coptic_monks.jpg|thumb|Coptic monks, between 1898 and 1914]]\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853, Pope Cyril IV established the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was only the second national press in the country. The Pope established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time, he left his Church under the guidance of the Coptic Patriarch.<ref name=\"StGeorge\"/>\n\nThe Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893. It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria and Cairo, and in various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt. It has campuses in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women study many subjects, including theology, church history, missionary studies, and the Coptic language.<ref name=\"StGeorge\"/>\n\n==Present day==\n{{Religion in Egypt}}\n[[File:Monastry3.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Coptic cathedral in [[Aswan]].]]\n\nOn 17 March 2012, the [[Coptic Orthodox Pope]], [[Pope Shenouda III]] died, leaving many Copts mourning and worrying as tensions rose with [[Muslims]]. Pope Shenouda III constantly met with Muslim leaders in order to create peace. Many were worried about Muslims controlling [[Egypt]] as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] won 70% of the parliamentary elections.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/world/middleeast/coptic-pope-shenouda-iiis-death-adds-to-fears-in-egypt.html | work=The New York Times | first=Kareem | last=Fahim | title=Coptic Pope Shenouda III's Death Adds to Fears in Egypt | date=20 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/04/egypt-election-results-muslim-brotherhood_n_1127897.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Muslim Brotherhood Sweeps Up Over One-Third Of Votes In Egyptian Elections | date=4 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2012, Bishop Tawadros was chosen as the 118th Pope. In a ritual filled with prayer, chants and incense at [[Abbassia|Abbasiya]] cathedral in Cairo, the 60-year-old bishop's name was picked by a blindfolded child from a glass bowl in which the names of two other candidates had also been placed. The enthronement was scheduled on 18 November 2012.\n\nIn 1959, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted its first own Patriarch by [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]]. Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] to form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gained its autocephelacy from the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]].\n\nThese three churches remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church do acknowledge the Honorary Supremacy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]], since the [[Church of Alexandria]] is technically their Mother Church. Upon their selection, both Patriarchs (Ethiopian & Eritrean) must receive the approval and communion from the Holy Synod of the [[Church of Alexandria|Apostolic See of Alexandria]] before their enthronement.\n\nSince the 1980s theologians from the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox and Eastern (Chalcedonian) Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing (see [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Agreed_Official_Statements_on_Christology_with_the_Catholic_and_Eastern_Orthodox_Churches Agreed Official Statements on Christology with the Eastern Orthodox Churches]).\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed<ref>[http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Pastoral_Agreement_between_the_Coptic_Orthodox_and_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchates_of_Alexandria_%282001%29 Official Statements on Christology].</ref> to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other. Previously, if a Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox wanted to get married, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, for it to be recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.\n\nAccording to Christian Tradition and Canon Law, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria only ordains men to the priesthood and episcopate, and if they wish to be married, they must be married before they are ordained. In this respect they follow the same practices as all other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], as well as all of [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]].\n\nTraditionally, the [[Coptic language]] was used in church services, and the scriptures were written in the [[Coptic alphabet]]. However, due to the Arabisation of Egypt, service in churches started to witness increased use of Arabic, while preaching is done entirely in Arabic. Native languages are used, in conjunction with Coptic, during services outside Egypt.\n\nThe liturgical calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church is the [[Coptic calendar]] (also called the Alexandrian Calendar). This calendar is based on the [[Egyptian calendar]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Coptic Orthodox Christians celebrate [[Christmas]] on 29 Koiak, which corresponds to 7 January in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and 25 December in the [[Julian Calendar]]. Coptic Christmas was adopted as an official national holiday in [[Egypt]] in 2002.\n\nIn [[Tahrir Square]], [[Cairo]], on Wednesday 2 February 2011, Coptic Christians joined hands to provide a protective cordon around their Muslim neighbors during [[salat]] (prayers) in the midst of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].<ref>[http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/03/5981906-christians-protect-muslims-during-prayer-in-cairos-dangerous-tahrir-square Christians protect Muslims during prayer in Cairo's dangerous Tahrir square], [[Nevine Zaki]], 3 February 2011, accessed 9 February 2011</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Coptic pope armenian catholicos and syrian patriarch.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] revived [[Ignatius Aphrem II]] Patriarch of Antioch and All East of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] [[Aram I]] Catholicose of Cilicia of the [[Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church]] in Lebanon.]]\nThere are about 20 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in the world.

It is still expanding in the continent of Africa.\n\n==Daughter churches==\n\n===Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church===\nEthiopia received Christianity next to Jerusalem, through Jesus's own apostle, only a year after Jesus was crucified (Acts 8: 26\u201339). Christianity became a national religion of Ethiopia, under the dominion of the Church of Alexandria, in the 4th century. The first bishop of Ethiopia, [[Frumentius|Saint Frumentius]], was consecrated as [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Bishop of Axum]] by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Pope Athanasius of Alexandria]] in AD&nbsp;328. From then on, until 1959, the [[Pope of Alexandria]], as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian (a Copt) to be the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Church. On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] reached an agreement concerning the relationship between the two churches. In 1950, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted autocephaly by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Five Ethiopian bishops were immediately consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, and were empowered to elect a new Patriarch for their church. This promotion was completed when Joseph II consecrated the first Ethiopian-born Archbishop, [[Abuna Basilios]], as head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951. In 1959, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] crowned [[Abuna Basilios]] as the first [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Patriarch of Ethiopia]].\n\nPatriarch Basilios died in 1971, and was succeeded on the same year by [[Abuna Theophilos]]. With the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] in 1974, the new Marxist government arrested Abuna Theophilos and secretly executed him in 1979. The Ethiopian government then ordered the Ethiopian Church to elect [[Abuna Takla Haymanot]] as Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abuna Takla Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Abuna Theophilos, and that the Ethiopian government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other.\n\nAfter the death of Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1988, [[Abune Merkorios]] who had close ties to the [[Derg]] (Communist) government was elected Patriarch of Ethiopia. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, Abune Merkorios abdicated under public and governmental pressure and went to exile in the United States. The newly elected Patriarch, [[Abune Paulos]] was officially recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1992 as the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] were resumed on 13 July 2007. Abune Paulos died in August 2012.\n\n===Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church===\nFollowing the independence of [[Eritrea]] from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Pope Shenouda ordained [[Abune Phillipos]] as first Archbishop of Eritrea. The [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] obtained autocephaly on 7 May 1998, and Abune Phillipos was subsequently consecrated as first Patriarch of Eritrea. The two churches remain in full communion with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], although the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, along with the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] does not recognize the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, [[Abune Antonios]].\n\n==Coptic Orthodox churches around the world==\n[[File:StMarkCopticOrthodoxChurchBellaireTX0.JPG|thumb|St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in [[Bellaire, Texas]]]]\n[[File:St Mark's Coptic Church Interior, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|St Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in [[London]], [[England]].]]\nThere are several [[:Category:Coptic Orthodox churches|Coptic Orthodox churches]] and institutions outside [[Egypt]], including churches and institutions in:\n\n*'''Africa''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Africa]]\n*'''Asia''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Asia]]\n*'''Australia and Oceania''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Australia]]\n*'''Europe''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Europe]]\n**'''Britain and Ireland''':see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Britain and Ireland]]\n**'''France''': see [[French Coptic Orthodox Church]] (autonomous)\n*'''North America''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in North America]]\n**'''United States''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States]]\n**'''Canada''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Canada]]\n**'''Mexico''': see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Mexico]]\n*'''South America''' see [[Coptic Orthodox Church in South America]]\n\n==Official titles of the Patriarch of Alexandria==\n\n===Episcopal titles===\n[[File:Chuck Kennedy - The Official White House Photostream - P060409CK-0199 (pd).jpg|thumb|[[Pope Shenouda III]], the 117th [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]] on the Holy Apostolic See of [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] (1971\u20132012).]]\n{{Main|Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria}}\n\n*The leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is known as ''[[List of Coptic Popes|Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle]]''.\n*His full title is Patriarch and Lord Archbishop of the Great City of Alexandria on the Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle that is, in [[Egypt]], [[Cyrenaica#Christianization|Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and all Africa.\n*The Successor of [[St. Mark]] the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]], Holy Apostle and Martyr, on the Holy Apostolic Throne of the Great City of [[Alexandria]].\n*[[List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]], being the [[Bishop|Diocesan Bishop]] of the Great and Ancient [[Metropolis]] of [[Alexandria]], that is in [[Alexandria]] and the metropolitan province of Greater [[Cairo]].\n*Elder [[Metropolitan Archbishop]] of the Egyptian Province.\n*[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of [[Egypt]], [[Cyrenaica#Christianization|Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]] and [[Sudan]].\n*Father of Fathers.\n*[[Shepherd]] of Shepherds.\n*[[Hierarch]] of all Hierarchs.\n\n===Honorary titles===\n*The Dean of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Great Catechetical School of Theology of Alexandria]].\n*The Ecumenical (Universal) Judge (Arbitrator) of the Holy Apostolic and Catholic (Universal) Church.\n*The 13th among the Holy [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]].\n*The Pillar and Defender of the [[Holy]], [[Catholic]] (Universal), [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] Church and of the [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Doctrine.\n\n===Historical evolution of the ecclesiastical title===\nThe patriarch of [[Alexandria]] was originally known merely as bishop of Alexandria. However, this title continued to evolve as the Church grew under Theophilus and his nephew and successor [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] ({{sm|a.d.}} 376\u2013444), and especially in the 5th century when the Church developed its hierarchy.\n\nThe bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first bishop in Roman Egypt consecrated by [[Saint Mark]], was honored by the other bishops as first among equals ''primus inter pares''. Under the sixth canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], Cyril was raised to prelate or chief bishop at the head of the episcopates of Egypt, [[Roman Libya|Libya]], and the [[Cyrenaica|Pentapolis]] without the existence of intermediate archbishops as existed in other ecclesiastic provinces.<ref name=Cannuyer1>Cannuyer, 2001, p. 40.</ref> He had the privilege of choosing and consecrating bishops.<ref name=\"Cannuyer1\" />\n\nThe title of \"pope\" has been attributed to the Patriarch of Alexandria since the episcopate of [[Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the 13th Patriarch of [[Alexandria]]. All the clergy of [[Alexandria]] and [[Lower Egypt]] honored him with the title ''papas'', which means \"father\" as the archbishop and metropolitan having authority over all bishops, within the Egyptian province, who are under his jurisdiction. [[Alexandria]], while the ecclesiastical and provincial capital, also had the distinction as being the place where [[Saint Mark]] was martyred.\n\nThe title \"[[Patriarch]]\" originally referred to a clan leader or head of a familial lineage. Ecclesiastically it means a bishop of high rank and was originally used as a title for the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. For the Coptic patriarch, this title was \"[[Patriarch]] of [[Alexandria]] and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist,\" that is \"of Egypt\". The title of \"Patriarch\" was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], convened in AD&nbsp;431, and ratified at [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in AD&nbsp;451.\n\nIt is to be noted that only the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] has the double title of \"Pope\" and \"Patriarch\" among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] ecumenical church heads.\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:StMarkcoptic.jpg|thumb|[[Coptic art|Coptic icon]] of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark the Evangelist]], the apostolic founder of the Church of Alexandria]]{{Main|The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria}}The Coptic Orthodox patriarchate of Alexandria is governed by its [[The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria|Holy Synod]], which is headed by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]].

According to TFI beliefs, this refers to keys that were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were revealed again through Karen Zerby as additional power for praying and obtaining miracles. TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for extra effect during prayer. The Keys, like most TFI beliefs, were digested in comic-book magazines to help teach them to children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.xfamily.org/docs/fam/mlk/mlk_190.pdf |format=PDF |title=Using The Keys Part 1 |website=archive.xfamily.org |accessdate=2016-07-24}}</ref> These beliefs are still generally held and practiced, even after the \"reboot\" documents of 2010.\n\n====Loving Jesus====\nThis is a term TFI members use to describe their intimate, sexual relationship with [[Jesus]].

But they take bridal theology further, encouraging members to imagine Jesus is joining them during [[sexual intercourse]] and [[masturbation]]. Male members are cautioned to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus. Many TFI publications, and spirit messages claimed to be from Jesus himself, elaborate this intimate, sexual relation they believe Jesus desires and needs.

Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and [[sexual behavior|reproductive behaviour]]. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently.<ref>[http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html Code of Hammurabi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921205329/http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html |date=21 September 2007 }} at commonlaw.com  {{cite |url=http://www.commonlaw.com/home/legal-history-and-philosophy/code-of-hammurabi |date=22 May 2017 |title=Code of Hammarubi at Commonlaw }}</ref> A few provisions address issues related to military service.\n\nThe code was discovered by modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]] in 1901, and its ''[[editio princeps]]'' translation published in 1902 by [[Jean-Vincent Scheil]].

However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.<ref>For this alternative interpretation see Jean Bott\u00e9ro, \"The 'Code' of Hammurabi\" in ''Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods'' (University of Chicago, 1992), pp. 156\u2013184.</ref>\n\nWhile the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim.

Traditionally, the cola ingredient is [[Coca-Cola]] (\"Coke\"), and the alcohol is a Cuban [[light rum]] such as [[Bacardi]].  However, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.\n\nThe cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.\n\n==History==\nThe drink was created in [[Cuba]] in the early 1900s, but its exact origins are not known with certainty.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|pp=248\u2013249}}{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=199\u2013200}} It became popular shortly after 1900, when bottled [[Coca-Cola]] was first imported into Cuba from the United States.{{sfn|Mariani|2015}}{{sfn|Brown|Miller|2009|pp=148\u2013150}} Its origin is associated with the heavy U.S. presence in Cuba following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. The drink's traditional name, \"Cuba Libre\" (Free Cuba), was the slogan of the Cuban independence movement.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=248}}{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=200}} The Cuba Libre is sometimes said to have been created during the Spanish\u2013American War.{{sfn|Kurlansky|2017}} However, this predates the first distribution of Coca-Cola to Cuba in 1900. A drink called a \"Cuba Libre\" was indeed known in 1898, but this was a mix of water and brown sugar.{{sfn|Mariani|2015}}\n\nFausto Rodriguez, a [[Bacardi]] advertising executive, claimed to have been present when the drink was first poured, and produced a notarized [[affidavit]] to that effect in 1965. According to Rodriguez, this took place in August 1900, when he was a 14-year-old messenger working for a member of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in [[Havana]]. One day at a local bar, Rodriguez's employer ordered Bacardi rum mixed with Coca-Cola. This intrigued a nearby group of American soldiers, who ordered a round for themselves, giving birth to a popular new drink.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|pp=248\u2013249}} Bacardi published Rodriguez's affidavit in a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine ad in 1966. However, Rodriguez's status as a Bacardi executive has led some commentators to doubt the veracity of his story.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Gjelten|2008|p=98}} Another story states that the drink was first created in 1902 at Havana's Restaurant La Florida to celebrate the anniversary of Cuban independence.{{sfn|Brown|Miller|2009|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe drink became a staple in Cuba, catching on due to the pervasiveness of its ingredients.{{sfn|Gjelten|2008|p=98}}  Havana was already known for its iced drinks in the 19th century, as it was one of the few warm-weather cities that had abundant stores of ice shipped down from colder regions.{{sfn|Kurlansky|2017}} Bacardi and other Cuban rums also boomed after independence brought in large numbers of foreign tourists and investors, as well as new opportunities for exporting alcohol. Light rums such as Bacardi became favored for cocktails, as they were considered to mix better than harsher [[dark rum]]s.{{sfn|Gjelten|2008|p=98}} Coca-Cola had been a common [[Drink mixer|mixer]] in the United States ever since it was first bottled in 1886, and it became a ubiquitous drink in many countries after it was first exported in 1900.{{sfn|Brown|Miller|2009|pp=148\u2013150}}{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=249}}\n\nRum and Coke quickly spread from Cuba to the United States. In the early 20th century the cocktail, like Coca-Cola itself, was most popular in the [[Southern United States]]. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] from 1922\u20131933, Coca-Cola became a favored mixer for disguising the taste of low-quality rums, as well as other liquors.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=200}} In 1921 [[H. L. Mencken]] jokingly wrote of a South Carolina variant called the \"jump stiddy\", which consisted of Coca-Cola mixed with [[denatured alcohol]] drained from automobile radiators.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=249}} After Prohibition, rum and Coke became prevalent in the Northern and Western U.S. as well, and in high-brow as well as low-brow circles.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=200}}\n\nRum and Coke achieved a new level of popularity during [[World War II]]. Starting in 1940, the United States established a series of outposts among the [[British West Indies]] to defend against the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]].{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=201\u2013202}} The American presence created cross-cultural demand, with American servicemen and the locals developing tastes for each other's products. In particular, American military personnel took to Caribbean rum due to its inexpensiveness, while Coca-Cola became especially prevalent in the islands thanks to the company shipping it out with the military.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=202\u2013203}} Within the United States, imported rum became increasingly popular, as government quotas for industrial alcohol reduced the output of American distillers of domestic liquors.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=249}} In 1943, [[Lord Invader]]'s [[Calypso music|Calypso]] song \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" drew further attention to the drink in [[Trinidad]]. The song was an adaptation of [[Lionel Belasco]]'s 1904 composition \"L'Ann\u00e9e Pass\u00e9e\" with new lyrics about American soldiers in Trinidad cavorting with local girls and drinking rum and Coke. Comedian [[Morey Amsterdam]] plagiarized \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" and licensed it to the [[Andrews Sisters]] as his own work. The Andrews Sisters' version was a major hit in 1945 and further boosted the popularity of rum and Coke, especially in the military. Lord Invader and the owners of Belasco's composition successfully sued Amsterdam for the song's rights.{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=250\u2013251}}{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=203\u2013205}}\n\nDuring the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, Bacardi fled to [[Puerto Rico]].{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|p=99}} The following year, the U.S. placed an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]] which prohibited the importation of Cuban products, while Cuba likewise banned the importation of American products. With Cuban-made rum unavailable in the U.S. and Coca-Cola unavailable in Cuba, it became impossible to make a rum and Coke with its traditional ingredients in either country.<ref name=Wondrich>{{cite news |last=Wondrich |first=David |date=February 3, 2013 |title=How To Make a Cuba Libre (That Is, Rum and Coke)|url=http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3769/cuba-libre-drink-recipe/|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |access-date=July 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity and reception==\n[[File:Cuba Libre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two Cuba Libres with [[lemon]] garnish]]\nThe rum and Coke is very popular; Bacardi estimates that it is the world's second most popular alcoholic drink.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite news |last= Wilson |first= Jason |date= April 26, 2011|title= Spirits: Long live the Cuba Libre |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/spirits-long-live-the-cuba-libre/2011/04/12/AFwGu9qE_story.html?utm_term=.d51e24a35185|url-access=subscription|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date= July 27, 2018}}</ref> Its popularity derives from the ubiquity and low cost of the main ingredients, and the fact that it is very easy to make. As it can be made with any quantity or style of rum, it is simple to prepare and difficult to ruin.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nDrink critics often have a low opinion of the cocktail. Writer Wayne Curtis called it \"a drink of inspired blandness\",{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=200}} while Jason Wilson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it \"a lazy person's drink\".<ref name=Wilson/> Troy Patterson of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called it \"the classic mediocre Caribbean-American [[highball]]\", which \"became a classic despite not being especially good\".<ref name=Patterson/>\n\n[[Charles A. Coulombe]] considers the Cuba Libre a historically important drink, writing that it is \"a potent symbol of a changing world order \u2013 the marriage of rum, lubricant of the old colonial empires, and Coca-Cola, icon of modern American global capitalism\". Additionally, both rum and Coca-Cola are made from Caribbean ingredients, and became global commodities through European and American commerce.  According to Coulombe, the drink \"seems to reflect perfectly the historical elements of the modern world\".{{sfn|Coulombe|2005|pp=98\u201399}}\n\n==Recipe and variations==\n[[File:Bundyrum24x6cans.JPG|thumb|Pre-mixed [[Bundaberg Rum]] & Cola, 2006]]\n\nRecipes vary somewhat in measures and additional ingredients, but the main ingredients are always rum and cola.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=201}} The [[International Bartenders Association]] recipe calls for 5 [[centiliter]]s of light rum, 12 cl of cola, and 1 cl of fresh lime juice on ice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iba-world.com/cocktails/cuba-libre/|title=Cuba Libre |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=iba-world.com |publisher=International Bartenders Association|access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref> However, any amount and proportion of rum and cola may be used. Additionally, while light rum is traditional, [[dark rum]]s and other varieties are also common.{{sfn|Curtis|2009|pp=200\u2013201}} Different colas are also often used; in fact in Cuba, Coca-Cola has not been imported since the U.S. embargo of 1960, so the domestic [[TuKola]] is used in Cuba Libres.<ref name=Imbibe/><ref name=Wondrich/>\n\nLime is traditionally included, though it is often left out, especially when the order is for just \"rum and Coke\".{{sfn|Curtis|2009|p=201}}<ref name=Imbibe>{{cite web |url=http://imbibemagazine.com/history-lesson-cuba-libre-cocktail/|title=History Lesson: The Cuba Libre Cocktail |last=Clarke |first=Paul |date=November 26, 2016 |website=[[Imbibe]] |access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref> Some early recipes called for lime juice to be mixed in, though others included lime only as a garnish.

Cosmic censorship is not merely a problem of formal interest; some form of it is assumed whenever [[black hole]] event horizons are mentioned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe hypothesis was first formulated by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969, and it is not stated in a completely formal way. In a sense it is more of a research program proposal: part of the research is to find a proper formal statement that is physically reasonable and that can be proved to be true or false (and that is sufficiently general to be interesting).<ref>[http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/nyt_bet_story.html A Bet on a Cosmic Scale, And a Concession, Sort Of (New York Times, February 12, 1997)]</ref>  Because the statement is not a strictly formal one, there is sufficient latitude for (at least) two independent formulations, a weak form, and a strong form.\n\n== Weak and strong cosmic censorship hypothesis ==\n\nThe weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis are two conjectures concerned with the global geometry of spacetimes.\n\nThe '''weak cosmic censorship hypothesis''' asserts there can be no singularity visible from [[future null infinity]]. In other words, singularities need to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a [[black hole]]. Mathematically, the conjecture states that, for generic initial data, the maximal Cauchy development possesses a complete future null infinity.\n\nThe '''strong cosmic censorship hypothesis''' asserts that, generically, general relativity is a deterministic theory, in the same sense that classical mechanics is a deterministic theory. In other words, the classical fate of all observers should be predictable from the initial data. Mathematically, the conjecture states that the maximal Cauchy development of generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data is locally inextendible as a regular [[Lorentzian manifold]].\n\nThe two conjectures are mathematically independent, as there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is valid but strong cosmic censorship is violated and, conversely, there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is violated but strong cosmic censorship is valid.\n\n==Example==\nThe [[Kerr metric]], corresponding to a black hole of mass <math>M</math> and angular momentum <math>J</math>, can be used to derive the [[effective potential]] for particle [[orbits]] restricted to the equator (as defined by rotation).  This potential looks like:<ref name=\"hartle_gravity\">James B Hartle, ''Gravity'' in chapter 15: Rotating Black Holes. (2003. {{ISBN|0-8053-8662-9}})</ref>\n:<math> V_{\\rm{eff}}(r,e,l)=-\\frac{M}{r}+\\frac{l^2-a^2(e^2-1)}{2r^2}-\\frac{M(l-a e)^2}{r^3},~~~\na\\equiv \\frac{J}{M} </math>\nwhere <math>r</math> is the coordinate radius, <math>e</math> and <math>l</math> are the test-particle's conserved energy and angular momentum respectively (constructed from the [[Killing vectors]]).\n\nTo preserve ''cosmic censorship'', the black hole is restricted to the case of <math>a < 1</math>.  For there to exist an [[event horizon]] around the singularity, the requirement <math>a < 1</math> must be satisfied.<ref name=\"hartle_gravity\" />  This amounts to the [[angular momentum]] of the black hole being constrained to below a critical value, outside of which the horizon would disappear.  \n\nThe following thought experiment is reproduced from Hartle's ''Gravity'':\n\n{{anchor|Violating cosmic censorship}}Imagine specifically trying to violate the censorship conjecture.  This could be done by somehow imparting an angular momentum upon the black hole, making it exceed the critical value (assume it starts infinitesimally below it).  This could be done by sending a particle of angular momentum <math>l = 2Me</math>.  Because this particle has angular momentum, it can only be captured by the black hole if the maximum potential of the black hole is less than <math>(e^2-1)/2</math>.\n\nSolving the above effective potential equation for the maximum under the given conditions results in a maximum potential of exactly <math>(e^2-1)/2</math>.  Testing other values shows that no particle with enough angular momentum to violate the censorship conjecture would be able to enter the black hole, '''because''' they have too much angular momentum to fall in.\n\n==Problems with the concept==\nThere are a number of difficulties in formalizing the hypothesis:\n\n* There are technical difficulties with properly formalizing the notion of a singularity.\n* It is not difficult to construct spacetimes which have naked singularities, but which are not \"physically reasonable\"; the canonical example of such a spacetime is perhaps the \"superextremal\" <math>M<|Q|</math> [[Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m]] solution, which contains a singularity at <math>r=0</math> that is not surrounded by a horizon. A formal statement needs some set of hypotheses which exclude these situations.\n* [[Caustic (mathematics)|Caustic]]s may occur in simple models of [[gravitational collapse]], and can appear to lead to singularities. These have more to do with the simplified models of bulk matter used, and in any case have nothing to do with general relativity, and need to be excluded.\n* Computer models of gravitational collapse have shown that naked singularities can arise, but these models rely on very special circumstances (such as spherical symmetry). These special circumstances need to be excluded by some hypothesis.\n\nIn 1991, [[John Preskill]] and [[Kip Thorne]] [[scientific wager|bet against]] [[Stephen Hawking]] that the hypothesis was false.  Hawking conceded the bet in 1997, due to the discovery of the special situations just mentioned, which he characterized as \"technicalities\". Hawking later reformulated the bet to exclude those technicalities. The revised bet is still open, the prize being \"clothing to cover the winner's nakedness\".[http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/new_naked_bet.html]\n(see also [[Thorne\u2013Hawking\u2013Preskill bet]].)\n\n== Counter-example ==\n\nAn exact solution to the scalar-Einstein equations <math>R_{ab}=2\\phi_a\\phi_b</math> which forms a counterexample to many formulations of the \ncosmic censorship hypothesis was found by Mark D.

All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and [[Church of the East]]) had always identified themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, and some [[Methodism|Methodists]] also believe that their churches are \"Catholic\" in the sense that they too are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. However, each church defines the scope of the \"Catholic Church\" differently. For instance, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox churches, and Church of the East, each maintain that their own [[Christian denomination|denomination]] is identical with the original universal church, from which all other denominations broke away.\n\nDistinguishing beliefs of [[Catholicity]], the beliefs of most Christians who call themselves \"Catholic\", include the [[episcopal polity]], that [[bishop]]s are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion,<ref>F.L. Cross, ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1977:175.</ref> as well as the [[Nicene Creed]] of AD 381.  In particular, along with unity, [[sanctity]], and [[apostolicity]], catholicity is considered one of [[Four Marks of the Church]],<ref>Christliche Religion, Oskar Simmel Rudolf St\u00e4hlin, 1960, 150</ref> found the line of the Nicene Creed: \"I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.\"\n\nDuring the medieval and modern times, additional distinctions arose regarding the use of the terms ''Western Catholic'' and ''Eastern Catholic''. Before the [[East\u2013West Schism]], those terms had just the basic geographical meanings, since only one undivided Catholicity existed, uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. After the split of 1054 terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and conflicting terminological systems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Google books |id=0UIKAQAAMAAJ |title=Inventing Latin Heretics: Byzantines and the Filioque in the Ninth Century }} pp.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Greek adjective ''katholikos'', the origin of the term \"catholic\" means \"universal\". Directly from the Greek, or via [[Late Latin]] ''catholicus'', the term ''catholic'' entered many other languages, becoming the base for the creation of various theological terms such as ''catholicism'' and ''[[catholicity]]'' ([[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', ''catholicitas'').\n\nThe term \"catholicism\" is the [[English language|English]] form of [[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', an abstract noun based on the adjective \"catholic\".

Srawley wrote:\n<blockquote>This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' (\u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). The original sense of the word is 'universal'. Thus Justin Martyr (''Dial''. 82) speaks of the 'universal or [[general resurrection]]', using the words \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the aggregate of all the Christian congregations' (Swete, ''Apostles Creed'', p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century]] it began to receive the secondary sense of '[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]' as opposed to '[[heresy|heretical]]'. Thus it is used in an early [[Biblical Canon|Canon of Scripture]], the [[Muratorian fragment]] (''circa'' 170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church'. So too [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world', but also 'because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men'. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.<ref>[J.H. Srawley, The Epistles of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, vol. II,] pp. 41-42</ref><ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html another edition], p.97</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy ''Catholic Church'' Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that \"he only seemed to suffer\" (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.<ref>\"As certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be Christians\". Ignatius said these heretics did not believe in the reality of Christ's flesh, which did suffer and was raised up again: \"They confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again\" (Smyrnaeans, 7) and called them \"beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with\" (Smyrnaeans, 4).</ref>\n\n===Other second-century uses===\nThe term is also used in the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' (155) and in the [[Muratorian fragment]] (about 177).\n\n===Cyril of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb]]\nAs mentioned in the above quotation from J.H. Srawley, [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315\u2013386), who is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]], distinguished what he called the \"Catholic Church\" from other groups who could also refer to themselves as an \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (assembly or church):\n<blockquote>Since the word [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]] is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, ''And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly'' (Acts 19:14), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a ''Church of evil doers'', I mean the meetings of the heretics, the [[Marcionism|Marcionists]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichees]], and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, \"And in one Holy Catholic Church\"; that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in which you were regenerated.

The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age.

In those days, terms \"eastern Catholic\" and \"western Catholic\" had their basic geographical meanings, generally corresponding to existing linguistic distinctions between Greek East and Latin West. In spite of various and quite frequent theological and ecclesiastical disagreements between major Christian sees, common [[Catholicity]] was preserved until the great disputes that arose between 9th and 11th century. After the [[East\u2013West Schism]], the notion of common [[Catholicity]] was broken and each side started to develop its own terminological practice.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAll major theological and ecclesiastical disputes in the Christian East or West have been commonly accompanied by attempts of arguing sides to deny each other the right to use the word \"Catholic\" as term of self-designation. After the acceptance of [[Filioque]] clause into the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Rome, Orthodox Christians in the East started to refer to adherents of Filioquism in the West just as \"Latins\" considering them no longer to be \"Catholics\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe dominant view in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that all Western Christians who accepted Filioque interpolation and unorthodox Pneumatology ceased to be Catholics, was held and promoted by famous Eastern Orthodox canonist [[Theodore Balsamon]] who was [[patriarch of Antioch]]. He wrote in 1190:\n\n{{quote|For many years the once illustrious congregation of the Western Church, that is to say, the Church of Rome, has been divided in spiritual communion from the other four Patriarchates, and has separated itself by adopting customs and dogmas alien to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox ... So no Latin should be sanctified by the hands of the priests through divine and spotless Mysteries unless he first declares that he will abstain from Latin dogmas and customs, and that he will conform to the practice of the Orthodox.<ref>{{Google books |id=KugGDAAAQBAJ |title=Heresy and the Making of European Culture: Medieval and Modern Perspectives }} p. 42</ref>}}\n\nOn the other side of the widening rift, Eastern Orthodox were considered by western theologians to be ''Schismatics''. Relations between East and West were further estranged by the tragic events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 and [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)#Sack of Constantinople|Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204. Those bloody events were followed  by several failed attempts to reach reconciliation (see: [[Second Council of Lyon]], [[Council of Florence]], [[Union of Brest]], [[Union of Uzhhorod]]). During the late medieval and early modern period, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems that exist today in all of their complexity.\n\nDuring the Early Modern period, a special term \"Acatholic\" was widely used in the West to mark all those who were considered to hold heretical theological views and irregular ecclesiastical practices. In the time of [[Counter-Reformation]] the term ''Acatholic'' was used by zealous members of the [[Catholic Church]] to designate [[Protestants]] as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term was considered to be so insulting that the Council of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Serbian Orthodox Church]], held in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temeswar]] in 1790, decided to send an official plea to emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], begging him to ban the use of the term \"Acatholic\".<ref>{{Google books |id=aSlYAAAAcAAJ |title=\u0420\u0430\u0434\u045a\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0431\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438\u043c\u0430 }} p. 210</ref>\n\n=== Lutheran Churches ===\nThe [[Augsburg Confession]] found within the [[Book of Concord]], a compendium of belief of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite web|title=Luther\u2019s Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|publisher=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|accessdate=22 February 2017|quote= When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

In 2000 she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Crystal Catherine Eastman in 1915.jpg|left|thumb]]\nCrystal Eastman was born in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]], on June 25, 1881, the third of four children.  Her oldest brother, Morgan, was born in 1878 and died in 1884 at age seven. The second brother, Anstice Ford Eastman, who became a general surgeon, was born in 1878 and died in 1937. Max was the youngest, born in 1882.  In 1883 their parents, Samuel Elijah Eastman and Annis Bertha Ford, moved the family to [[Canandaigua, New York]].  In 1889, their mother became one of the first women ordained as a [[Protestant]] minister in America when she became a minister of the [[Congregational Church]].<ref>Ida Harper Husted, \u201cA Woman Minister Who Presides Over a Large Eastern Church.\u201d ''The San Francisco Chronicle,'' 27 January 1901.</ref> Her father was also a Congregational minister, and the two served as pastors at the church of [[Thomas K. Beecher]] near [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]]. This part of [[New York (state)|New York]] was in the so-called \"[[Burned-over_district|Burnt Over District]].\" During the [[Second Great Awakening]] earlier in the 19th century, its frontier had been a center of evangelizing and much religious excitement, which resulted in the founding of the [[Shakers]] and [[Mormonism]]. During the [[wiktionary:antebellum|antebellum]] period, some were inspired by religious ideals to support such progressive social causes as [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\nCrystal and her brother [[Max Eastman]] were influenced by this progressive tradition. Their  parents were friendly with the writer [[Mark Twain]]. From this association young Crystal also became acquainted with him.\n\n\nShe was the sister of the [[socialism|socialist]] activist [[Max Eastman]], with whom she was quite close throughout her life.<ref name=nwhm>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Crystal Eastman\n |publisher   = National Women's History Museum\n |url         = http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/crystal-eastman/\n |accessdate  = 18 October 2011\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120123051653/http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/crystal-eastman/\n |archivedate = 23 January 2012\n |df          = \n}}</ref> The two lived together for several years on 11th Street in [[Greenwich Village]] among other radical activists.<ref>Robert E.

She was at one time called the \"most dangerous woman in America,\" due to her [[free-love]] idealism and outspoken nature.\n\n==Emancipation==\n\nDuring a brief marriage to Wallace J. Benedict which ended in divorce, Eastman moved to [[Milwaukee]] and managed the unsuccessful 1912 [[Wisconsin]] [[suffrage]] campaign.<ref name=nwhm />\n\nWhen she returned east in 1913, she joined [[Alice Paul]], [[Lucy Burns]], and others in founding the militant [[Congressional Union]], which became the [[National Woman's Party]]. After the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] gave women the right to vote in 1920, Eastman and Paul wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first introduced in 1923. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, she warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it, but she felt that it was still a struggle worth fighting. She also delivered the speech, \"Now We Can Begin\" following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, outlining the work that needed to be done in the political and economic spheres to achieve gender equality.\n\n==Peace efforts==\n\n[[File:Eastman-Crystal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crystal Eastman was a noted anti-militarist, who helped found the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].]]\nDuring [[World War I]], Eastman was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]], soon joined by [[Jane Addams]], [[Lillian D.

Renamed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in 1921, it remains the oldest extant women's peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], which lobbied against America's entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in 1916, sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing, and campaigned against [[conscription]], imperial adventures and [[military intervention]].<ref>https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i</ref>\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I, Eastman organized with [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] and [[Norman Thomas]] the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] to protect [[conscientious objectors]], or in her words: \"To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over.\" The NCLB grew into the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], with Baldwin at the head and Eastman functioning as attorney-in-charge. Eastman is credited as a founding member of the ACLU, but her role as founder of the NCLB may have been largely ignored by posterity due to her personal differences with Baldwin.<ref name=vassar />\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist [[Walter Fuller (editor)|Walter Fuller]], who had come to the United States to direct his sisters\u2019 singing of folksongs.<ref>G. Peter Winnington, ''Walter Fuller: The Man Who Had Ideas.'' Letterworth Press, 2014. pp.188\u201390</ref>  They had two children, [[Jeffrey Fuller|Jeffrey]] and Annis.  They worked together as activists until the end of the war; then he worked as the managing editor of ''The Freeman'' until 1922, when he returned to [[England]]. He died in 1927, nine months before Crystal, ending his career editing ''[[Radio Times]]'' for the [[BBC]].\n\nAfter Max Eastman's periodical ''[[The Masses]]'' was forced to close by government censorship in 1917, he and Crystal co-founded a radical journal of politics, art, and literature, ''[[The Liberator (United States magazine)|The Liberator]]'', early in 1918.<ref name=nwhm />  She and Max co-edited it until they put it in the hands of faithful friends in 1922.<ref>G. Peter Winnington, ''Walter Fuller: The Man Who Had Ideas,'' p.307</ref>\n\n===Post-War===\nAfter the war, Eastman organized the [[First Feminist Congress]] in 1919.\n\nShe traveled by ship to [[London]] to be with her husband at times. In New York, her activities led to her being blacklisted during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919-1920. She struggled to find paying work.\n\nDuring the 1920s her only paid work was as a columnist for feminist journals, notably ''[[Equal Rights (journal)|Equal Rights]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''.  Eastman claimed that \"life was a big battle for the complete feminist,\" but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.\n\n===Death===\nCrystal Eastman died on July 8, 1928, of [[nephritis]].<ref name=vassar /> Her friends were entrusted with her two children, then orphans, to rear them until adulthood.\n\n==Legacy==\nEastman has been called one of the United States' most neglected leaders, because, although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for fifty years. [[Freda Kirchwey]], then editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', wrote at the time of her death: \"When she spoke to people\u2014whether it was to a small committee or a swarming crowd\u2014hearts beat faster.

His life's work or the best of his works is The Nature of Order on which he spent about 30 years, and the very first version of The Nature of Order was done in 1981, one year before this famous debate with Peter Eisenman in Harvard.\n\nAlexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]],'' a perennial seller some four decades after publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1459281087&sr=8-1&keywords=a+pattern+language|title=A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|first3=search|last3=results|first4=search|last4=results|first5=Ingrid|last5=Fiksdahl-King|first6=Shlomo|last6=Angel|date=7 June 1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Amazon}}</ref> Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2NSI4vSu_IC&pg=PA42&dq=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0htfQ-O3KAhVE32MKHYy5BfkQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=inauthor:%22Christopher+Alexander%22+%22users+of+a+building+know+more%22&f=false|title=The Oregon Experiment|first1=Christopher|last1=Alexander|first2=Professor in the Department of Architecture Christopher|last2=Alexander|first3=Murray|last3=Silverstein|first4=Shlomo|last4=Angel|first5=Sara|last5=Ishikawa|first6=Danny|last6=Abrams|date=7 June 1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUGiAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj97JbG9-3KAhUS5GMKHWBkDIUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22christopher+alexander%22+%22users+know%22&f=false|title=How to Study Public Life|first1=Jan|last1=Gehl|first2=Birgitte|last2=Svarre|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Island Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1991-1/the-oregon-experiment-revisited|title=The Oregon Experiment after Twenty Years - RAIN|author=|date=|website=www.rainmagazine.com}}</ref> he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa, [[Murray Silverstein]], Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a \"[[pattern language]]\" to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.\n\n==Personal life==\nAs a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2008|title=ARCH+ Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Architektur und St\u00e4dtebau|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in [[Chichester]] and [[Oxford]], England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He moved to [[Berkeley, California]] in 1963 to accept an appointment as Professor of Architecture, a position he would hold for almost 40 years. In 2002, after his retirement, Alexander moved to [[Arundel]], England, where he continues to write, teach and build. Alexander is married to Margaret Moore Alexander, and he has two daughters, Sophie and Lily, by his former wife Pamela.\n\n==Education==\nAlexander attended [[Oundle School]], England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies.\n\n==Honors==\nAlexander was elected to the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]], Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/2014/reflections-on-puarl-01062014/christopher-alexander-aia-medal|title=AIA First Medal for Research|author=AIA Journal|date=August 1972}}</ref>; elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;<ref>*[http://acsa-arch.org/programs-events/awards/archives/DP ACSA Archives, Distinguished Professor Award winners.]</ref> invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded the Seaside Prize, 1994; elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1996;<ref name=AAAS/> one of the two inaugural recipients of the Athena Award, given by the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU), 2006;. awarded (''in absentia'') the [[Vincent Scully Prize]] by the [[National Building Museum]], 2009; awarded the lifetime achievement award by the [[Urban Design Group]], 2011; winner of the [[Global Award for Sustainable Architecture]], 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patternlanguage.com/bios/vitae.htm|title=Curriculum Vitae|author=|date=|website=www.patternlanguage.com}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Author===\n\n''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:\n\n{{quote|There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.}}\n\n''[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]'' (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].\n\nThe work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.\n\nThe book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.\n\nA notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.\n\nThe book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete. It uses [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities.\n\nThis book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.\n\nThe idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.\n\n''A New Theory of Urban Design'' (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in [[urbanism]] among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in [[San Francisco]], it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only ''local'' rules, in relation to neighbours. A vastly undervalued part of the Alexander canon, ''A New Theory'' is important in understanding the generative processes which give rise to the [[shanty town]]s latterly championed by [[Stewart Brand]],<ref>See Chapter 2 of his ''Whole Earth Discipline'', 2009.</ref> [[Robert Neuwirth]],<ref>''Shadow Cities: a billion squatters, a new urban world'', 2004.</ref> and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]].<ref name=\"Hanson-Youn\u00e9s\">See Brian Hanson & Samir Youn\u00e9s, \"Reuniting Urban Form and Urban Process: The Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force\", ''Journal of Urban Design'', v.6, no.2 (June 2001), pp.185-209; Charles, Prince of Wales, speech at the \"Traditional Urbanism in Contemporary Practice\" conference at The Prince's Foundation, London, 20 November 2003.</ref> There have been critical reconstructions of Alexander's design studio based on the theories put forward in ''A New Theory of Urban Design''.<ref name=\"Warped\">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7550339/Warped_educational_strategies_in_simulation_of_practice|title=Gareth Griffiths, \"Warped educational strategies in simulation of practice\", in ''Nordic Journal of Architectural Research'', 1/2013.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]]'' (2003\u201304), which includes The ''Phenomenon of Life'', ''The Process of Creating Life'', ''A Vision of a Living World'' and ''The Luminous Ground'', is Alexander's most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in which we view the world in general. The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by more dynamic sequences, which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). Sequences, like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).\n\nThe online publication ''Katarxis 3'' (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and [[Peter Eisenman]] from 1982.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm |title=Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture: The 1982 Debate Between Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlexander's latest book, ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems'' (2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies (System B). As Alexander describes it, System A is focused on enhancing the life/spirit of spaces within given constraints (land, budget, client needs, etc.) (drawings are sketches - decisions on placing buildings, materials used, finish and such are made in the field as construction proceeds, with adjustments as needed to meet overall budget); System B ignores, and tends to diminish or destroy that quality (architect responsible for drawings which the builder uses to build structures at the lowest possible cost). In the last few chapters he describes \"centers\" as a way of thinking about the connections among spaces, and about what brings more wholeness and life to a space.\n\n===Works of architecture===\nAmong Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near [[Tokyo]] (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth''); the West Dean Visitors Centre <ref>''[http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/westdean.htm England, The West Dean Visitors Centre]'' - Project History</ref> in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the [[Sala House]] and the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California made of lightweight concrete); the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses''); and several private houses (described and illustrated in ''The Nature of Order''). Alexander's built work is characterized by a special quality (which he used to call \"the quality without a name\", but named \"wholeness\" in ''Nature of Order'') that relates to human beings and induces feelings of belonging to the place and structure. This quality is found in the most loved traditional and historic buildings and urban spaces, and is precisely what Alexander has tried to capture with his sophisticated mathematical design theories. Paradoxically, achieving this connective human quality has also moved his buildings away from the abstract imageability valued in contemporary architecture, and this is one reason why his buildings are under-appreciated at present.<ref name=\"nikos\" />\n\nHis former student and colleague [[Michael Mehaffy]] wrote an introductory essay on Alexander's built work in the online publication ''Katarxis 3'', which includes a gallery of Alexander's major built projects through September 2004.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Gallery.htm |title=Gallery |work=Kataraxis |volume=3 |access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Teaching===\nIn addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at [[UC Berkeley]] (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales's Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990\u20131994) and [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]].<ref>[https://www.architectural-review.com/rethink/viewpoints/lessons-from-prince-charles/8636206.article Architectural Review, September 2012]></ref> He also initiated the process which led to the international [[Building Beauty]] post-graduate school for architecture, which launched in Sorrento, Italy for the 2017-18 academic year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buildingbeauty.org/|title=Building Beauty \u2013 First Level Master in Architecture|author=|date=|website=buildingbeauty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buildinggreen.com/newsbrief/architecture-hands-search-beauty|title=Architecture as a Hands-on Search for Beauty|author=|date=27 December 2017|website=buildinggreen.com}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n\n===Architecture===\n\nAlexander's work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are [[Sarah Susanka]],<ref>Sarah Susanka: ''Not So Big House'', Taunton Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1561583766}}</ref> [[Andres Duany]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katarxis3.com/Duany.htm|title=Andres Duany, Architect and Urban Theorist|author=|date=|website=www.katarxis3.com}}</ref> and [[Witold Rybczynski]].<ref name=\"nbm.org\">http://www.nbm.org/support-us/awards_honors/scully-prize/christopher-alexander.html</ref> [[Robert Campbell (journalist)|Robert Campbell]], the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the ''Boston Globe'', stated that Alexander \"has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that's true of a whole generation of people.\"<ref name=\"nbm.org\"/>\n\nArchitecture critic [[Peter Buchanan (architect)|Peter Buchanan]], in an essay for ''[[The Architectural Review]]''{{'}}s 2012 campaign ''The Big Rethink'', argues that Alexander's work as reflected in ''A Pattern Language'' is \"thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be.\" He continues:\n{{quote|Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction\u2014although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them.

He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of ''The Nature of Order''. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in spirit to Google's PageRank.<ref>{{Cite journal| arxiv=1502.03554 | title=Wholeness as a Hierarchical Graph to Capture the Nature of Space | journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science | volume=29 | issue=9 | pages=1632 | first=Bin | last=Jiang | date=27 March 2015| doi=10.1080/13658816.2015.1038542 }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe fourth volume of ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter, [[human perception]] of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and [[belief]]s, and recent scientific advances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natureoforder.com/summarybk4.htm|title=SUMMARY OF BOOK FOUR OF THE NATURE OF ORDER|author=|date=|website=www.natureoforder.com}}</ref> Despite his leanings toward [[Deism]], and his naturalistic and anthropological approach to religion, Alexander maintains that he is a practicing member of the [[Catholic Church]], believing it to embody a great deal of accumulated human truth within its rituals<!-- There is no mention of 'accumulated human truth' or 'rituals' in the linked article. -->.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden|title=Making the Garden - Christopher Alexander|author=|date=|website=firstthings.com}}</ref>\n\n===Design science===\nThe life's work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book ''Notes on the Synthesis of Forms'', he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure in ''[[The Nature of Order]]''. The design principles are differentiation and adaptation.\n\n===Complex networks===\nIn his classic \u2018A City is Not a Tree\u2019, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book \u2018Notes on the synthesis of forms\u2019 on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004: [[Community structure]].\n\n==Published works==\nAlexander's published works include:\n\n* ''Community and Privacy'', with [[Serge Chermayeff]] (1963)\n* ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'' (1964)\n* [http://www.rudi.net/books/200 ''A City is Not a Tree''] (1965)\n* ''The Atoms of Environmental Structure'' (1967)\n* ''A Pattern Language which Generates Multi-service Centers'', with Ishikawa and Silverstein (1968)\n* ''Houses Generated by Patterns'' (1969)\n* [http://www.livingneighborhoods.org/library/grassroots.htm ''The Grass Roots Housing Process''] (1973)\n*  The ''Center for Environmental Structure Series'', made up of\n** ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'' (1975)\n** ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', with Ishikawa and Silverstein (1977)\n** ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' (1979)\n** ''The Linz Cafe'' (1981)\n** ''The Production of Houses'', with Davis, Martinez, and Corner (1985)\n** ''A New Theory of Urban Design'', with Neis, Anninou, and King (1987)\n** ''Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art: The Color and Geometry of Very Early Turkish Carpets'' (1993)\n** ''The Mary Rose Museum'', with Black and Tsutsui (1995)\n* ''[[The Nature of Order]] Book 1: The Phenomenon of Life'' (2002)\n* ''[[The Nature of Order]] Book 2: The Process of Creating Life'' (2002)\n* ''[[The Nature of Order]] Book 3: A Vision of a Living World'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Nature of Order]] Book 4: The Luminous Ground'' (2004)\n* ''The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle between Two World-Systems, ''with HansJoachim Neis and Maggie More Alexander (2012)\n\nUnpublished:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transitionculture.org/2010/12/23/exclusive-to-transition-culture-an-interview-with-christopher-alexander/|title=Exclusive to Transition Culture!

In the United Kingdom it has been collected as an omnibus edition titled ''Corum'', ''Swords of Corum'' and most recently ''Corum: The Prince in the Scarlet Robe'' (vol. 30 of [[Orion Books|Orion's]] [[Fantasy Masterworks]] series).  In the United States the first trilogy has been published as ''Corum: The Coming of Chaos''.\n\n====Plot====\nCorum is a Vadhagh, one of a race of long-lived beings with limited magical abilities dedicated to peaceful pursuits such as art and poetry.  A group of \"Mabden\" (men) led by the savage Earl Glandyth-a-Krae raid the family castle and slaughter everyone with the exception of Corum, who escapes. Arming himself, Corum attacks and kills several of the Mabden before being captured and tortured. After having his left hand cut off and right eye put out, Corum escapes by moving into another plane of existence, becoming invisible to the Mabden. They depart and Corum is found by The Brown Man, a dweller of the forest of Laar able to see Corum while out of phase. The Brown Man takes Corum to a being called Arkyn, who treats his wounds and explains he has a higher purpose.\n\nTravelling to Moidel's Castle, Corum encounters his future lover, the Margravine Rhalina, a mabden woman of the civilized land of Lwym an Esh.  Having found out Corum's location by torturing and killing the Brown Man of Laar, Glandyth-a-Krae marshalled his allies to Moidel's Castle. Glandyth had kept Corum's former hand and eye as souvenirs, and showed them to Corum to provoke a reaction.  Rhalina uses sorcery (a ship summoned from the depths of the ocean and manned by her drowned dead husband and crew) to ward off an attack by Glandyth-a-Krae. Determined to restore himself, Corum and Rhalina travel to the island of Shool, a near immortal and mad sorcerer. During the journey Corum observes a mysterious giant who trawls the ocean with a net. On arrival at the island Shool takes Rhalina hostage, and then provides Corum with two [[magic item|artifact]]s to replace his lost hand and eye: the Hand of Kwll and the Eye of Rhynn. The Eye of Rhynn allows Corum to see into an undead netherworld where the last beings killed by Corum exist until summoned by the Hand of Kwll.\n\nShool then explains that Corum's ill fortune has been caused by the Chaos God [[Arioch]], the Knight of the Swords. When Arioch and his fellow Chaos Lords conquered the Fifteen Planes, the balance between the forces of [[Law and Chaos]] tipped in favor of Chaos, and their minions - such as Glandyth-a-Krae - embarked on a bloody rampage. Shool sends Corum to Arioch's fortress to steal the Heart of Arioch, which the sorcerer intends to use to attain greater power. Corum confronts Arioch, and learns Shool is nothing more than a pawn of the Chaos God. Arioch then ignores Corum, who discovers the location of the Heart. Corum is then attacked by Arioch, but the Hand of Kwll crushes the Heart and banishes the Chaos God forever. Before fading from existence, Arioch warns Corum that he has now earned the enmity of the Sword Rulers. Corum returns to the island to rescue Rhalina, and observes Shool has become a powerless moron, and is devoured by his own creations soon afterwards. Corum learns Arkyn is in fact a Lord of Law, and that this is the first step towards Law regaining control of the Fifteen Planes.\n\nOn another five planes, the forces of Chaos - led by [[Xiombarg]], Queen of the Swords - reign supreme and are on the verge on eradicating the last resistance from the forces of Law. The [[avatar]]s of the Bear and Dog gods plot with Earl Glandyth-a-Krae to murder Corum and return Arioch to the Fifteen Planes. Guided by Arkyn, Corum, Rhalina and companion Jhary-a-Conel cross the planes and encounter the King Without A Country, the last of his people who in turn is seeking the City in the Pyramid. The group locate the City, which is in fact a floating arsenal powered by advanced technology and inhabited by a people originally from Corum's world and his distant kin.\n\nBesieged by the forces of Chaos, the City requires certain rare minerals to continue to power their weapons. Corum and Jhary attempt to locate the minerals and also encounter Xiombarg, who learns of Corum's identity. Corum slows Xiombarg's forces by defeating their leader, Prince Gaynor the Damned. Xiombarg is goaded into attacking the City directly in revenge for Arioch's banishment. Arkyn provides the minerals and confronts Xiombarg, who has manifested in a vulnerable state. As Arkyn banishes Xiombarg, Corum and his allies devastate the forces of Chaos. Glandyth-a-Krae, however, escapes, and seeks revenge.\n\nA spell - determined to have been cast by the forces of Chaos - forces the inhabitants of Corum's plane to war with each other (including the City in the Pyramid). Desperate to stop the slaughter, Corum, Rhalina and Jhary-a-Conel travel to the last five planes, ruled by Mabelode, the King of the Swords. Rhalina is taken hostage by the forces of Chaos and Corum has several encounters with the forces of Chaos, including Earl Glandyth-a-Krae.\n\nCorum also meets two other aspects of the Eternal Champion: [[Elric]] and [[Erekos\u00eb]], with all three seeking the mystical city of [[Tanelorn]] for their own purposes. After a brief adventure in the \"Vanishing Tower\", the other heroes depart and Corum and Jhary arrive at their version of Tanelorn. Corum discovers one of the \"Lost Gods\", the being Kwll, who is imprisoned and cannot be freed until whole. Corum offers Kwll his hand, on the condition that he aid them against Mabelode. Kwll accepts the terms, but reneges on the bargain until persuaded to assist. Corum is also stripped of his artificial eye, which belongs to Rhynn - actually the mysterious giant Corum had previously encountered. Kwll transports Corum and Jhary to the court of Mabelode, with the pair fleeing with Rhalina when Kwll directly challenges the Chaos God.\n\nIn a final battle Corum avenged his family by killing Glandyth-a-Krae and decimating the last of Chaos' mortal forces. Kwll later located Corum and revealed that all the gods - of both Chaos and Law - have been slain in order to free humanity and allow it to shape its own destiny.\n\n===''The Silver Hand'' Trilogy===\nThis trilogy consists of ''The Bull and the Spear'' (1973), ''The Oak and the Ram'' (1973), and ''The Sword and the Stallion'' (1974). It was titled ''The Prince with the Silver Hand'' in the United Kingdom and ''The Chronicles of Corum'' in the United States respectively. The previous trilogy hinted at a [[Celts|Celtic]] or proto-Celtic setting for the stories - the terms ''mabden'' (human beings) and ''shefanhow'' (demons) occurring in these books are both [[Cornish language]] words. The Silver Hand trilogy is more explicit in its Celtic connections, with overt borrowings from Celtic mythology.\n\n====Plot====\nSet eighty years after the defeat of the Sword Rulers, Corum has become despondent and alone since the death of his Mabden bride Rhalina. Plagued by voices at night, Corum believes he has gone insane until old friend [[Jhary-a-Conel]] advises Corum it is in fact a summons from another world. Listening to the voices allows Corum to pass to the other world, which is in fact the distant future. The descendants of Rhalina's folk, the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich (see: [[Crom Cruach]]), who call Corum \"Corum Llew Ereint\" (see: [[Lludd Llaw Eraint]]), face extinction by the Fhoi Myore ([[Fomorians]]). The Fhoi Myore, seven powerful but diseased and barely sentient giants, with the aid of their allies have conquered the land and plunged it into eternal winter. Allying himself with King Mannach, ruler of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, Corum falls in love with his daughter Medhbh (see: [[Medb]]).\n\nCorum also hears the prophecy of a [[Prophet|seeress]], who claims Corum should fear a brother (who will apparently slay him), a harp and above all, beauty. Corum seeks the lost artifacts of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich - a sacred Bull, a spear, an oak, a ram, a sword and a stallion - which will restore the land. Corum gains new allies, [[Gofannon|Goffanon]] (a [[blacksmith]] and diminutive giant, a member of the [[Sidhe]] race) and Goffanon's cousin and true giant Illbrec. They battle the Fhoi Myore, who  themselves have allies: a returned Prince Gaynor, the wizard Calatin and his [[Cloning|clone]] of Corum, the Brothers of the Pine, the undead Ghoolegh and a host of giant [[C\u0175n Annwn|demonic dogs]]. After being instrumental in the death of two of the Fhoi Myore and restoring to his senses the enscorceled [[Amergin Gl\u00faingel|Amergin]], the High King and Chief Druid of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, Corum and his allies fight a final battle in which all their foes are destroyed.\n\nCorum decides not to return his own world, and is attacked by his clone, whom he defeats with the aid of a spell placed on his silver hand by Medhbh. Medhbh, however, attacks and wounds Corum, having been told by the being the [[The Dagda|Dagdah]] that their world must be free of all gods and demi-gods if they are to flourish as a people. Corum is then killed with his own sword by his animated silver hand, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n''The Swords'' trilogy:\n* ''The Knight of the Swords'' (1971)\n* ''The Queen of the Swords'' (1971)\n* ''The King of the Swords'' (1971)\n\n''The Silver Hand'' trilogy:\n* ''The Bull and the Spear'' (1973)\n* ''The Oak and the Ram'' (1973)\n* ''The Sword and the Stallion'' (1974)\n\nAdditional appearances:\n* ''The Vanishing Tower'' (1971)\n* ''The Sailor on the Seas of Fate'' (1976)\n* ''The Quest for Tanelorn'' (1976)\n\n==Awards==\nThe [[August Derleth Award]] won by:\n\n* ''The Knight of the Swords'' - won in 1972\n* ''The King of the Swords'' - won in 1973\n* ''The Sword and the Stallion'' - won in 1975\n\n== In other media ==\n===Comics===\n[[First Comics]] published ''The Chronicles of Corum'', a twelve issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] (Jan. 1986 - Dec. 1988) that adapted the \"Swords Trilogy\", and was followed by the four issue limited series ''Corum: The Bull and the Spear'' (Jan. - July (bi-monthly) 1989), which adapted the first book in the second trilogy.\n\n===Role-Playing Game===\nDarcsyde Productions produced a supplement for use with [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' (2001) [[role-playing game]] adapting the characters and settings from the ''Corum'' series for role-playing.\n\n===eBooks===\n[[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] have announced plans to release the entire Corum stories in both print and ebook form, commencing in 2013.

A modern RISC processor can therefore be much more complex than, say, a modern microcontroller using a CISC-labeled [[instruction set]], especially in the complexity of its electronic circuits, but also in the number of instructions or the complexity of their encoding patterns. The only typical differentiating characteristic is that most RISC designs use uniform instruction length for almost all instructions, and employ strictly separate load/store-instructions.\n\nExamples of instruction set architectures that have been retroactively labeled CISC are [[System/360]] through [[z/Architecture]], the [[PDP-11]] and [[VAX]] architectures, [[Data General Nova]] and many others. Well known microprocessors and microcontrollers that have also been labeled CISC in many academic publications include the [[Motorola 6800]], [[6809]] and [[68000]]-families; the Intel [[8080]], [[iAPX432]] and [[x86]]-family; the Zilog [[Z80]], [[Zilog Z8|Z8]] and [[Z8000]]-families; the National Semiconductor [[32016]] and [[NS320xx]]-line; the MOS Technology [[6502]]-family; the Intel [[8051]]-family; and others.\n\nSome designs have been regarded as borderline cases by some writers. For instance, the Microchip Technology [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] has been labeled RISC in some circles and CISC in others. The [[6502]] and [[6809]] have both been described as \"RISC-like\", although they have complex addressing modes as well as arithmetic instructions that operate on memory, contrary to the RISC-principles.\n\n==Historical design context==\n\n===Incitements and benefits===\nBefore the RISC philosophy became prominent, many [[computer architecture|computer architects]] tried to bridge the so-called [[semantic gap]], i.e., to design instruction sets that directly support high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex [[addressing mode]]s, allowing data structure and array accesses to be combined into single instructions. Instructions are also typically highly encoded in order to further enhance the code density. The compact nature of such instruction sets results in smaller [[Computer program|program]] sizes and fewer (slow) main memory accesses, which at the time (early 1960s and onwards) resulted in a tremendous saving on the cost of computer memory and disc storage, as well as faster execution. It also meant good [[programming productivity]] even in [[assembly language]], as [[high level language]]s such as [[Fortran]] or [[ALGOL|Algol]] were not always available or appropriate. Indeed, microprocessors in this category are sometimes still programmed in assembly language for certain types of critical applications{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\n====New instructions====\nIn the 1970s, analysis of high-level languages indicated some complex machine language implementations and it was determined that new instructions could improve performance. Some instructions were added that were never intended to be used in assembly language but fit well with compiled high-level languages. Compilers were updated to take advantage of these instructions. The benefits of semantically rich instructions with compact encodings can be seen in modern processors as well, particularly in the high-performance segment where caches are a central component (as opposed to most [[embedded system]]s). This is because these fast, but complex and expensive, memories are inherently limited in size, making compact code beneficial. Of course, the fundamental reason they are needed is that main memories (i.e., [[dynamic RAM]] today) remain slow compared to a (high-performance) CPU core.\n\n===Design issues===\nWhile many designs achieved the aim of higher throughput at lower cost and also allowed high-level language constructs to be expressed by fewer instructions, it was observed that this was not ''always'' the case. For instance, low-end versions of complex architectures (i.e. using less hardware) could lead to situations where it was possible to improve performance by ''not'' using a complex instruction (such as a procedure call or enter instruction), but instead using a sequence of simpler instructions.\n\nOne reason for this was that architects ([[microcode]] writers) sometimes \"over-designed\" assembly language instructions, including features which could not be implemented efficiently on the basic hardware available. There could, for instance, be \"side effects\" (above conventional flags), such as the setting of a register or memory location that was perhaps seldom used; if this was done via ordinary (non duplicated) internal buses, or even the external bus, it would demand extra cycles every time, and thus be quite inefficient.\n\nEven in balanced high-performance designs, highly encoded and (relatively) high-level instructions could be complicated to decode and execute efficiently within a limited transistor budget. Such architectures therefore required a great deal of work on the part of the processor designer in cases where a simpler, but (typically) slower, solution based on decode tables and/or microcode sequencing is not appropriate. At a time when transistors and other components were a limited resource, this also left fewer components and less opportunity for other types of performance optimizations.\n\n====The RISC idea====\nThe circuitry that performs the actions defined by the microcode in many (but not all) CISC processors is, in itself, a processor which in many ways is reminiscent in structure to very early CPU designs. In the early 1970s, this gave rise to ideas to return to simpler processor designs in order to make it more feasible to cope without (''then'' relatively large and expensive) ROM tables and/or [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] structures for sequencing and/or decoding. The first (retroactively) RISC-''labeled'' processor ([[IBM 801]]{{snd}} [[IBM]]'s Watson Research Center, mid-1970s) was a tightly pipelined simple machine originally intended to be used as an internal microcode kernel, or engine, in CISC designs, but also became the processor that introduced the RISC idea to a somewhat larger public. Simplicity and regularity also in the visible instruction set would make it easier to implement overlapping processor stages ([[Pipeline (computing)|pipelining]]) at the machine code level (i.e. the level seen by compilers). However, pipelining at that level was already used in some high performance CISC \"supercomputers\" in order to reduce the instruction cycle time (despite the complications of implementing within the limited component count and wiring complexity feasible at the time). Internal microcode execution in CISC processors, on the other hand, could be more or less pipelined depending on the particular design, and therefore more or less akin to the basic structure of RISC processors.\n\n====Superscalar====\nIn a more modern context, the complex variable-length encoding used by some of the typical CISC architectures makes it complicated, but still feasible, to build a [[superscalar]] implementation of a CISC programming model ''directly''; the in-order superscalar original [[Intel P5|Pentium]] and the out-of-order superscalar [[Cyrix 6x86]] are well known examples of this. The frequent memory accesses for operands of a typical CISC machine may limit the instruction level parallelism that can be extracted from the code, although this is strongly mediated by the fast cache structures used in modern designs, as well as by other measures. Due to inherently compact and semantically rich instructions, the average amount of work performed per machine code unit (i.e. per byte or bit) is higher for a CISC than a RISC processor, which may give it a significant advantage in a modern cache based implementation.\n\nTransistors for logic, PLAs, and microcode are no longer scarce resources; only large high-speed cache memories are limited by the maximum number of transistors today. Although complex, the transistor count of CISC decoders do not grow exponentially like the total number of transistors per processor (the majority typically used for caches). Together with better tools and enhanced technologies, this has led to new implementations of highly encoded and variable length designs without load-store limitations (i.e. non-RISC). This governs re-implementations of older architectures such as the ubiquitous x86 (see below) as well as new designs for [[microcontroller]]s for [[embedded system]]s, and similar uses. The superscalar complexity in the case of modern x86 was solved by converting instructions into one or more [[micro-operations]] and dynamically issuing those micro-operations, i.e. indirect and dynamic superscalar execution; the [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5]] are early examples of this. It allows a fairly simple superscalar design to be located after the (fairly complex) decoders (and buffers), giving, so to speak, the best of both worlds in many respects.  This technique is also used in [[IBM z196]] and later [[z/Architecture]] microprocessors.\n\n====CISC and RISC terms====\nThe terms CISC and RISC have become less meaningful with the continued evolution of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations. The first highly (or tightly) pipelined x86 implementations, the 486 designs from [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Cyrix]], and [[IBM]], supported every instruction that their predecessors did, but achieved ''maximum efficiency'' only on a fairly simple x86 subset that was only a little more than a typical RISC instruction set (i.e. without typical RISC ''[[load-store architecture|load-store]]'' limitations). The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] generation was a superscalar version of these principles. However, modern x86 processors also (typically) decode and split instructions into dynamic sequences of internally buffered [[micro-operations]], which not only helps execute a larger subset of instructions in a pipelined (overlapping) fashion, but also facilitates more advanced extraction of parallelism out of the code stream, for even higher performance.\n\nContrary to popular simplifications (present also in some academic texts{{which|date=November 2015}}), not all CISCs are microcoded or have \"complex\" instructions. As CISC became a catch-all term meaning anything that's not a load-store (RISC) architecture, it's not the number of instructions, nor the complexity of the implementation or of the instructions themselves, that define CISC, but the fact that arithmetic instructions also perform memory accesses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Compared to a small 8-bit CISC processor, a RISC floating-point instruction is complex. CISC does not even need to have complex addressing modes; 32 or 64-bit RISC processors may well have more complex addressing modes than small 8-bit CISC processors.\n\nA [[PDP-10]], a [[PDP-8]], an [[Intel 80386]], an [[Intel 4004]], a [[Motorola 68000]], a [[System z]] mainframe, a [[Burroughs B5000]], a [[VAX]], a [[Zilog Z80000]], and a [[MOS Technology 6502]] all vary wildly in the number, sizes, and formats of instructions, the number, types, and sizes of registers, and the available data types. Some have hardware support for operations like scanning for a substring, arbitrary-precision BCD arithmetic, or [[transcendental function]]s, while others have only 8-bit addition and subtraction. But they are all in the CISC category because they have \"load-operate\" instructions that load and/or store memory contents within the same instructions that perform the actual calculations. For instance, the PDP-8, having only 8 fixed-length instructions and no microcode at all, is a CISC because of ''how'' the instructions work, PowerPC, which has over 230 instructions (more than some VAXes), and complex internals like register renaming and a reorder buffer, is a RISC, while [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/arch/cisc/ Minimal CISC] has 8 instructions, but is clearly a CISC because it combines memory access and computation in the same instructions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer science}}\n* [[Computer architecture]]\n* [[Zero instruction set computer|ZISC]]\n* [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]]\n* [[Microcode]]\n* [[Comparison of instruction set architectures]]\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n* Tanenbaum, Andrew S.

Baleen whales have [[vibrissae|short hairs]] on their mouth, unlike the toothed whales. Cetaceans have well-developed senses\u2014their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and baleen whales have a [[somatosensory system|tactile system]] in their vibrissae. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to maintain body heat in cold water. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths.\n\nAlthough cetaceans are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend their lives in the water, having to mate, give birth, [[moulting|molt]] or escape from predators, like [[killer whale]]s, underwater. This has drastically affected their anatomy to be able to do so. They feed largely on fish and [[marine invertebrates]]; but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals and birds, such as [[penguin]]s and seals. Some baleen whales (mainly [[gray whale]]s and right whales) are specialised for feeding on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] creatures. Male cetaceans typically mate with more than one female ([[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]]), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. Cetaceans are not known to have [[pair bond]]s. Male cetacean strategies for [[reproductive success]] vary between herding females, defending potential mates from other males, or [[whale song]] which attracts mates. Calves are typically born in the fall and winter months, and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species [[fasting|fast]] and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time, which is more typical of baleen whales as their main food source (invertebrates) aren't found in their breeding and calving grounds ([[tropics]]). Cetaceans produce a number of [[animal communication|vocalizations]], notably the clicks and whistles of dolphins and the moaning songs of the [[humpback whale]].\n\nThe meat, blubber and oil of cetaceans have traditionally been used by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]]. Cetaceans have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks, other cetaceans aren't as often kept in captivity (with usually unsuccessful attempts). Cetaceans have been relentlessly [[whaling|hunted]] by commercial industries for their products, although this is now forbidden by international law. The [[baiji]] (Chinese river dolphin) has become \"Possibly Extinct\" in the past century, while the [[vaquita]] and [[Yangtze finless porpoise]] are ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. Besides hunting, cetaceans also face threats from [[bycatch|accidental trapping]], [[marine pollution]], and ongoing climate change.\n\n== Baleen whales and toothed whales ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe two parvorders, [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti) and [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), are thought to have diverged around thirty-four million years ago.\n\nBaleen whales have bristles made of [[keratin]] instead of [[teeth]]. The bristles filter [[krill]] and other small [[invertebrate]]s from seawater. [[Grey whale]]s feed on bottom-dwelling mollusks. [[Rorqual]] [[Family (biology)|family]] (balaenopterids) use throat pleats to expand their mouths to take in food and sieve out the water. [[Balaenidae|Balaenids]] ([[right whales]] and [[bowhead whales]]) have massive heads that can make up 40% of their body mass. Most mysticetes prefer the food-rich colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, migrating to the Equator to give birth. During this process, they are capable of fasting for several months, relying on their fat reserves.\n\nThe parvorder of Odontocetes \u2013 the toothed whales \u2013 include sperm whales, beaked whales, killer whales, dolphins and porpoises. Generally the teeth are designed for catching fish, squid or other [[marine invertebrates]], not for chewing them, so prey is swallowed whole. Teeth are shaped like cones (dolphins and sperm whales), spades (porpoises), pegs (belugas), tusks (narwhals) or variable (beaked whale males). Female beaked whales' teeth are hidden in the gums and are not visible, and most male beaked whales have only two short tusks. Narwhals have vestigial teeth other than their tusk, which is present on males and 15% of females and has millions of nerves to sense water temperature, pressure and salinity. A few toothed whales, such as some [[killer whale]]s, feed on mammals, such as [[pinnipeds]] and other whales.\n\nToothed whales have well-developed senses \u2013 their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have advanced [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|sonar capabilities]] using their [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].  Their hearing is so well-adapted for both air and water that some blind specimens can survive. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths. Several species of toothed whales show [[sexual dimorphism]], in which the males differ from the females, usually for purposes of sexual display or aggression.\n\n== Anatomy ==\n[[File:Dolphin Anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dolphin anatomy]]\n\nCetacean bodies are generally similar to that of fish, which can be attributed to their lifestyle and the habitat conditions. Their body is well-adapted to their habitat, although they share essential characteristics with other higher mammals ([[Eutheria]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite news |last1=Groves |last2=Colin |first3=Peter |last3=Grubb |title=Ungulate taxonomy |newspaper=JHU Press |year=2011}} {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThey have a streamlined shape, and their forelimbs are flippers.

For this reason, the usual terrestrial compact bones, which are finely woven [[cancellous bone]], are replaced with lighter and more elastic material. In many places, bone elements are replaced by cartilage and even fat, thereby improving their [[hydrostatic]] qualities. The ear and the muzzle contain a bone shape that is exclusive to cetaceans with a high density, resembling [[porcelain]]. This conducts sound better than other bones, thus aiding [[biosonar]].\n\nThe number of [[vertebrae]] that make up the spine varies by species, ranging from forty to ninety-three. The [[cervical spine]], found in all mammals, consists of seven vertebrae which, however, are reduced or fused. This fusion provides stability during swimming at the expense of mobility. The fins are carried by the [[thoracic vertebrae]], ranging from nine to seventeen individual vertebrae. The [[sternum]] is cartilaginous. The last two to three pairs of ribs are not connected and hang freely in the body wall. The stable lumbar and tail include the other vertebrae. Below the [[caudal vertebrae]] is the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron bone]].\n\nThe front limbs are paddle-shaped with shortened arms and elongated finger bones, to support movement. They are connected by cartilage. The second and third fingers display a proliferation of the finger members, a so-called hyperphalangy. The shoulder joint is the only functional joint in all cetaceans except for the [[Amazon river dolphin]]. The [[collarbone]] is completely absent.\n\n== Physiology ==\n\n=== Circulation ===\nCetaceans have powerful hearts. Blood oxygen is distributed effectively throughout the body. They are warm-blooded, i.e., they hold a nearly constant body temperature.\n\n=== Respiration ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nCetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea are deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.\n\nThe structure of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[circulatory system]]s is of particular importance for the life of [[marine mammals]]. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The muscle pigment, [[myoglobin]], provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.\n\n=== Organs ===\nThe stomach consists of three chambers. The first region is formed by a loose gland and a muscular forestomach (missing in beaked whales), which is then followed by the main stomach and the [[pylorus]]. Both are equipped with glands to help digestion. A bowel adjoins the stomachs, whose individual sections can only be distinguished [[Histology|histologically]]. The [[liver]] is large and separate from the [[gall bladder]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=C. Edward Stevens|author2=Ian D.

The salt concentration in cetacean blood is lower than that in seawater, requiring kidneys to excrete salt. This allows the animals to drink [[seawater]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Clifford A.

This means only species with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good [[binocular vision]] forward and downward. [[Lacrimal gland|Tear glands]] secrete greasy tears, which protect the eyes from the salt in the water. The lens is almost spherical, which is most efficient at focusing the minimal light that reaches deep water. Cetaceans make up for their generally poor vision (except dolphins) with excellent hearing.\n\nAt least one species, the [[tucuxi]] or Guiana dolphin, is able to use [[electroreception]] to sense prey.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last=Morell |first=Virginia |title=Guiana Dolphins Can Use Electric Signals to Locate Prey |work=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) |date=July 2011 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/07/guiana-dolphins-can-use-electric.html?ref=hp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040210/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/07/guiana-dolphins-can-use-electric.html?ref=hp |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ears ===\n[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Biosonar]]]]\nThe external ear has lost the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] (visible ear), but still retains a narrow [[external auditory meatus]]. To register sounds, instead, the posterior part of the [[mandible]] has a thin lateral wall (the pan bone) fronting a concavity that houses a fat pad. The pad passes anteriorly into the greatly enlarged [[mandibular foramen]] to reach in under the teeth and posteriorly to reach the thin lateral wall of the [[ectotympanic]]. The ectotympanic offers a reduced attachment area for the [[tympanic membrane]]. The connection between this auditory complex and the rest of the skull is reduced\u2014to a single, small cartilage in [[oceanic dolphin]]s.\n\nIn odontocetes, the complex is surrounded by spongy tissue filled with air spaces, while in mysticetes, it is integrated into the skull as with land mammals. In odontocetes, the tympanic membrane (or ligament) has the shape of a folded-in umbrella that stretches from the ectotympanic ring and narrows off to the [[malleus]] (quite unlike the flat, circular membrane found in land mammals.) In mysticetes, it also forms a large protrusion (known as the \"glove finger\"), which stretches into the external [[External acoustic meatus|meatus]] and the [[stapes]] are larger than in odontocetes. In some [[Kogia|small sperm whales]], the malleus is fused with the ectotympanic.\n\nThe ear [[ossicles]] are [[Pachyosteosclerosis|pachyosteosclerotic]] (dense and compact) and differently shaped from land mammals (other aquatic mammals, such as [[sirenia]]ns and earless seals, have also lost their pinnae).

This complex is located in a cavity in the middle ear, which, in the Mysticeti, is divided by a bony projection and compressed between the exoccipital and squamosal, but in the odontoceti, is large and completely surrounds the bulla (hence called \"peribullar\"), which is, therefore, not connected to the skull except in [[Physeteroidea|physeterids]]. In the Odontoceti, the cavity is filled with a dense foam in which the bulla hangs suspended in five or more sets of ligaments. The pterygoid and peribullar [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]] that form the cavity tend to be more developed in shallow water and riverine species than in [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] Mysticeti.

These include the vaquita, which inhabits a small part of the [[Gulf of California]] and [[Hector's dolphin]], which lives in some coastal waters in New Zealand. Both species prefer deeper marine areas and species that live frequently or exclusively in coastal and shallow water areas.{{Clarify|reason=Huh?|date=March 2016}}\n\nMany species inhabit specific latitudes, often in tropical or subtropical waters, such as [[Bryde's whale]] or [[Risso's dolphin]].

Researchers then explore whether the animal shows signs of self-recognition.<ref name=\"Mirror test\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nCritics claim that the results of these tests are susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for [[primates]]. Primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses. Advocates counter that the behaviors are different from normal responses to another individual. Cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, because they have no pointing ability.<ref name=\"Mirror test\" />\n\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used video to test dolphin self-awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1026|pages=205\u2013224|pmid=8521259}}<!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--></ref> They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been replicated, dolphins later \"passed\" the mirror test.<ref name=\"Mirror test\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n\n=== Reproduction and brooding ===\nMost cetaceans sexually mature at seven to 10 years. An exception to this is the [[La Plata dolphin]], which is sexually mature at two years, but lives only to about 20. The sperm whale reaches sexual maturity within about 20 years and a lifespan between 50 and 100 years.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nFor most species, reproduction is seasonal. [[Ovulation]] coincides with male [[fertility]]. This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements that can be observed in many species. Most toothed whales have no fixed bonds. In many species, females choose several partners during a season. Baleen whales are largely [[monogamous]] within each reproductive period.\n\nGestation ranges from 9 to 16 months. Duration is not necessarily a function of size. Porpoises and blue whales gestate for about 11 months. During gestation, the embryo is fed by a special nutritive tissue, the [[placenta]].\n\nCetaceans usually bear one calf. In the case of twins, one usually dies, because the mother cannot produce sufficient milk for both. The fetus is positioned for a tail-first delivery, so that the risk of drowning during delivery is minimal. After birth, the mother carries the infant to the surface for its first breath. At birth they are about one-third of their adult length and tend to be independently active, comparable to terrestrial [[mammals]].\n\n==== Suckling ====\nLike other placental mammals, cetaceans give birth to well-developed calves and nurse them with milk from their [[mammary glands]]. When suckling, the mother actively splashes milk into the mouth of the calf, using the muscles of her mammary glands, as the calf has no lips. This milk usually has a high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46%, causing the calf to increase rapidly in size and weight.<ref name=\"mann\" />\n\nIn many small cetaceans, suckling lasts for about four months. In large species, it lasts for over a year and involves a strong bond between mother and offspring.\n\nThe mother is solely responsible for brooding. In some species, so-called \"aunts\" occasionally suckle the young.\n\nThis reproductive strategy provides a few offspring that have a high survival rate.\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nAmong cetaceans, whales are distinguished by an unusual longevity compared to other higher mammals. Some species, such as the [[bowhead whale]] (''Balaena mysticetus''), can reach over 200 years. Based on the annual rings of the bony [[otic capsule]], the age of the oldest known specimen is a male determined to be 211 years at the time of death.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=John C George|author2=Jeffrey Bada|author3=Judith Zeh|author3-link= Judy Zeh |author4=Laura Scott|author5=Stephen E Brown|author6=Todd O'Hara|author7=Robert Suydam|title=Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (''Balaena mysticetus'') via aspartic acid racemization|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1999|volume=77|issue=4|doi=10.1139/z99-015|pages=571\u2013580}}<!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--></ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Whale fall}}\nUpon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life.

Initially, organisms such as [[shark]]s and [[hagfish]] scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaetes]], throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]] enabling the growth of [[chemoautotrophic]] organisms, which in turn, support organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 per site.<ref name=\"Smith&Baco2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x/pdf |author1=Fujiwara, Yoshihiro|title=Three-year investigations into sperm whale-fall ecosystems in Japan |journal=Marine Ecology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=219\u2013230|date=16 February 2007|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x|bibcode=2007MarEc..28..219F}}</ref>\n\n== Disease ==\n[[Brucellosis]] affects almost all mammals.

Both groups had already developed the typical anatomical features of today's whales, such as hearing. Life in the water for a formerly terrestrial creature required significant adjustments such as the fixed bulla, which replaces the mammalian [[eardrum]], as well as sound-conducting elements for submerged directional hearing. Their wrists were stiffened and probably contributed to the typical build of flippers. The hind legs existed, however, but were significantly reduced in size and with a vestigial pelvis connection.<ref name=\"Thewissen\" />\n\n==== Transition from land to sea ====\n[[File:Adult female and fetal Maiacetus.jpg|thumb|Fossil of a ''Maiacetus'' (red, beige skull) with fetus (blue, red teeth) shortly before the end of gestation <ref name=\"Gingerich PD\" />]]\nThe fossil record traces the gradual transition from terrestrial to aquatic life. The regression of the hind limbs allowed greater flexibility of the spine. This made it possible for whales to move around with the vertical tail hitting the water. The front legs transformed into flippers, costing them their mobility on land.\n\nOne of the oldest members of ancient cetaceans ([[Archaeoceti]]) is ''[[Pakicetus]]'' from the Middle Eocene. This is an animal the size of a wolf, whose skeleton is known only partially. It had functioning legs and lived near the shore. This suggests the animal could still move on land. The long snout had [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] dentition.<ref name=\"Thewissen\"/>\n\nThe transition from land to sea dates to about 49 million years ago, with the ''[[Ambulocetus]]'' (\"running whale\"), discovered in [[Pakistan]]. It was up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The limbs of this archaeocete were leg-like, but it was already fully aquatic, indicating that a switch to a lifestyle independent from land happened extraordinarily quickly.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ando |first=Konami |last2=Fujiwara |first2=Shin-ichi |date=2016-07-10 |title=Farewell to life on land - thoracic strength as a new indicator to determine paleoecology in secondary aquatic mammals |journal=Journal of Anatomy |language=en |volume=229 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013777 |doi=10.1111/joa.12518 |issn=0021-8782 |pmc=5108153 |pmid=27396988}}</ref> The snout was elongated with overhead nostrils and eyes.

The body was streamlined and delicate with extended hand and foot bones. The merged pelvic [[lumbar spine]] was present, making it possible to support the floating movement of the tail. It was likely a good swimmer, but could probably move only clumsily on land, much like a modern [[Pinniped|seal]].<ref name=\"Thewissen\" />\n\n==== Marine animals ====\nSince the late Eocene, about 40 million years ago, cetaceans populated the subtropical oceans and no longer emerged on land. An example is the 18-m-long ''[[Basilosaurus]]'', sometimes referred to as ''Zeuglodon''. The transition from land to water was completed in about 10 million years.

This activity has gone on since the [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], reasons for whaling included their [[whale meat|meat]], [[whale oil|oil]] usable as fuel and the jawbone, which was used in house construction. At the end of the Middle Ages, early whaling fleets aimed at [[baleen whales]], such as [[bowhead whales|bowheads]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch fleet had about 300 whaling ships with 18,000 crewmen.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, baleen whales especially were hunted for their [[baleen]], which was used as a replacement for wood, or in products requiring strength and flexibility such as [[corset]]s and [[crinoline]] skirts. In addition, the [[spermaceti]] found in the [[sperm whale]] was used as a machine lubricant and the [[ambergris]] as a material for pharmaceutical and perfume industries. In the second half of the 19th century, the explosive [[harpoon]] was invented, leading to a massive increase in the catch size.\n\nLarge ships were used as \"mother\" ships for the whale handlers. In the first half of the 20th century, whales were of great importance as a supplier of raw materials. Whales were intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 whales were killed. This increased to over 40,000 animals per year up to the 1960s, when stocks of large baleen whales collapsed.\n\nMost hunted whales are now threatened, with some great whale populations exploited to the brink of extinction. Atlantic and Korean [[gray whale]] populations were completely eradicated and the [[North Atlantic right whales|North Atlantic right whale]] population fell to some 300-600. The [[blue whale]] population is estimated to be around 14,000.\n\nThe first efforts to protect whales came in 1931. Some particularly endangered species, such as the [[humpback whale]] (which then numbered about 100 animals), were placed under international protection and the first protected areas were established. In 1946, the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) was established, to monitor and secure whale stocks. Whaling for commercial purposes was prohibited worldwide by this organization from 1985 to 2005.\n\nThe stocks of species such as humpback and blue whales have recovered, though they are still threatened. The United States Congress passed the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] sustain the marine mammal population. It prohibits the taking of marine mammals except for several hundred per year taken in Alaska. Japanese whaling ships are allowed to hunt whales of different species for ostensibly scientific purposes.\n\n[[Aboriginal whaling]] is still permitted. About 1,200 pilot whales were taken in the [[Faroe Islands]] in 2017.,<ref name=\"faroe\">{{Cite web |url=http://heimabeiti.fo/default.asp?menu=400 |title=Hagar & sey\u00f0amark |website=heimabeiti.fo |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> and about 900 [[narwhal]]s and 800 [[beluga whale|belugas]] per year are taken in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. About 150 minke are taken in Greenland per year, 120 gray whales in Siberia and 50 bowheads in Alaska, as aboriginal whaling, besides the 600 minke taken commercially by Norway, 300 minke and 100 sei taken by Japan and up to 100 fin whales taken by Iceland.<ref name=\"iwcatch\">{{Cite web |url=https://iwc.int/total-catches |title=Total Catches |website=iwc.int |language=en |access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> Iceland and Norway do not recognize the ban and operate commercial whaling. Norway and Japan are committed to ending the ban.\n\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans are sometimes hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats, usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]] and [[Japan]] (the most well-known practitioner). Dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]]. Despite the controversy thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\n\n==== Fishing ====\n{{See also|Cetacean bycatch}}\n[[File:Domino whale-bone hg.jpg|thumb|[[Dominoes]] made of baleen]]\nDolphin pods often reside near large tuna shoals. This is known to fishermen, who look for dolphins to catch tuna. Dolphins are much easier to spot from a distance than tuna, since they regularly breathe. The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they will net a tuna shoal. When the nets are pulled together, the dolphins become entangled under water and drown. Line fisheries in larger rivers are threats to [[river dolphins]].\n\nA greater threat than by-catch for small cetaceans is targeted hunting. In Southeast Asia, they are sold as fish-replacement to locals, since the region's edible fish promise higher revenues from exports. In the Mediterranean, small cetaceans are targeted to ease pressure on edible fish.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\n==== Strandings ====\n{{Main|Cetacean stranding}}\nA stranding is when a cetacean leaves the water to lie on a beach. In some cases, groups of whales strand together. The best known are mass strandings of [[pilot whale]]s and sperm whales. [[Cetacean stranding|Stranded]] cetaceans usually die, because their as much as {{convert|90|MT|ST}} body weight compresses their lungs or breaks their ribs. Smaller whales can die of heatstroke because of their thermal insulation.\n\nThe causes are not clear. Possible reasons for mass beachings are:<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n* toxic contaminants\n* debilitating parasites (in the respiratory tract, brain or middle ear)\n* infections (bacterial or viral)\n* flight from predators (including humans)\n* social bonds within a group, so that the pod follows a stranded animal\n* disturbance of their magnetic senses by natural anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field\n* injuries\n* noise pollution by shipping traffic, seismic surveys and military sonar experiments\n\nSince 2000, whale strandings frequently occurred following military [[sonar]] testing. In December 2001, the US Navy admitted partial responsibility for the beaching and the deaths of several marine mammals in March 2000. The coauthor of the interim report stated that animals killed by active sonar of some Navy ships were injured. Generally, underwater noise, which is still on the increase, is increasingly tied to strandings; because it impairs communication and sense of direction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrope, Mark. |title=Whale deaths caused by US Navy's sonar |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=106 |pages=106 |year=2003  |doi=10.1038/415106a|bibcode = 2002Natur.415..106S |pmid=11805797}}</ref>\n\n[[Climate change]] influences the major wind systems and ocean currents, which also lead to cetacean strandings. Researchers studying strandings on the Tasmanian coast from 1920\u20132002 found that greater strandings occurred at certain time intervals. Years with increased strandings were associated with severe storms, which initiated cold water flows close to the coast. In nutrient-rich, cold water, cetaceans expect large prey animals, so they follow the cold water currents into shallower waters, where the risk is higher for strandings. Whales and dolphins who live in pods may accompany sick or debilitated pod members into shallow water, stranding them at low tide. Once stranded, large whales are crushed by their own body weight, if they cannot quickly return to the water. In addition, body temperature regulation is compromised.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Environmental hazards ====\n{{See also|Marine mammals and sonar}}\n{{Quote box|quote=Worldwide, use of active sonar has been linked to about 50 marine mammal strandings between 1996 and 2006. In all of these occurrences, there were other contributing factors, such as unusual (steep and complex) underwater geography, limited egress routes, and a specific species of marine mammal \u2014 beaked whales \u2014 that are suspected to be more sensitive to sound than other marine mammals.\n|source=\u2014Rear Admiral Lawrence Rice|align=left|width=30%}}\nHeavy metals, residues of many plant and insect venoms and plastic waste [[flotsam]] are not biodegradable. Sometimes, cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to disease and have fewer offspring.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\nDamage to the [[ozone layer]] reduces plankton reproduction because of its resulting radiation. This shrinks the food supply for many marine animals, but the filter-feeding baleen whales are most impacted. Even the [[Nekton]] is, in addition to intensive exploitation, damaged by the radiation.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\nFood supplies are also reduced long-term by [[ocean acidification]] due to increased absorption of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The CO<sup>2</sup> reacts with water to form [[carbonic acid]], which reduces the construction of the [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons of food supplies for zooplankton that baleen whales depend on.<ref name=\"wdcs\" />\n\nThe military and resource extraction industries operate strong [[sonar]] and blasting operations.

There, it is called Ketos, a term that initially included all large marine animals. From this was derived the Roman word for whale, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. Other names were ph\u00e1laina ([[Aristotle]], [[Latin]] form of ballaena) for the female and, with an ironic characteristic style, musculus (Mouse) for the male. [[North Sea]] whales were called Physeter, which was meant for the sperm whale ''Physter macrocephalus''. Whales are described in particular by Aristotle, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ambrose]]. All mention both live birth and suckling. Pliny describes the problems associated with the lungs with spray tubes and Ambrose claimed that large whales would take their young into their mouth to protect them.\n\nIn the [[Bible]] especially, the leviathan plays a role as a [[sea monster]]. The essence, which features a giant crocodile or a dragon and a whale, was created according to the Bible by God<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|104:26}}</ref> and should again be destroyed by him.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|74:14}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|27:1}}.</ref> In the [[Book of Job]], the leviathan is described in more detail.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|40:25}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse|Job|41:26}}</ref>\n\nIn Jonah there is a more recognizable description of a whale alongside the prophet [[Jonah]], who, on his flight from the city of [[Nineveh]] is swallowed by a whale.\n\nDolphins are mentioned far more often than whales. Aristotle discusses the sacred animals of the Greeks in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' and gives details of their role as aquatic animals. The Greeks admired the dolphin as a \"king of the aquatic animals\" and referred to them erroneously as fish. Its intelligence was apparent both in its ability to escape from fishnets and in its collaboration with fishermen.\n\nRiver dolphins are known from the [[Ganges]] and \u2013 erroneously \u2013 the [[Nile]]. In the latter case it was equated with sharks and catfish. Supposedly they attacked even [[crocodile]]s.\n\nDolphins appear in Greek mythology. Because of their intelligence, they rescued multiple people from drowning. They were said to love music \u2013 probably not least because of their own song \u2013 they saved, in the legends, famous musicians such as [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] from [[Mithymna|Methymna]] or [[\\|Kairanos]] from Miletus. Because of their mental faculties, dolphins were considered for the god [[Dionysus]].\n[[File:Cetus constellation map.png|thumb|left|Constellation Cetus]]\nDolphins belong to the domain of [[Poseidon]] and led him to his wife [[Amphitrite]]. Dolphins are associated with other gods, such as [[Apollo]], Dionysus and [[Aphrodite]]. The Greeks paid tribute to both whales and dolphins with their own constellation. The constellation of the [[Cetus|Whale]] (Ketos, lat. Cetus) is located south of the Dolphin (Delphi, lat. Delphinus) north of the [[zodiac]].\n\nAncient art often included dolphin representations, including the Cretan [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]. Later they appeared on reliefs, gems, lamps, coins, mosaics and gravestones. A particularly popular representation is that of Arion or the [[Taras (mythology)]] riding on a dolphin. In early [[Christian art]], the dolphin is a popular motif, at times used as a symbol of [[Christ]].\n\n==== Middle Ages to the 19th century ====\n{{See also|History of Whaling|Cryptid whales}}\n[[St. Brendan]] described in his travel story ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani'' an encounter with a whale, between the years 565\u2013573. He described how he and his companions entered a treeless island, which turned out to be a giant whale, which he called Jasconicus. He met this whale seven years later and rested on his back.\n\nMost descriptions of large whales from this time until the whaling era, beginning in the 17th century, were of beached whales, which resembled no other animal. This was particularly true for the sperm whale, the most frequently stranded in larger groups. [[Raymond Gilmore]] documented seventeen sperm whales in the estuary of the Elbe from 1723 to 1959 and thirty-one animals on the coast of Great Britain in 1784. In 1827, a blue whale beached itself off the coast of Ostend. Whales were used as attractions in museums and traveling exhibitions.\n[[File:La Baleine.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of baleen whaling, 1840]]\n[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holl\u00e4ndischen K\u00fcste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|right|Stranded sperm whale engraving, 1598]]\nWhalers in the 17\u201319th centuries depicted whales in drawings and recounted tales of their occupation. Although they knew that whales were harmless giants, they described battles with harpooned animals. These included descriptions of sea monsters, including huge whales, sharks, sea snakes, giant squid and octopuses.\n\nAmong the first whalers who described their experiences on whaling trips was Captain [[William Scoresby]] from Great Britain, who published the book ''Northern Whale Fishery'', describing the hunt for northern baleen whales. This was followed by [[Thomas Beale]], a British surgeon, in his book ''Some observations on the natural history of the sperm whale'' in 1835; and Frederick Debell Bennett's ''The tale of a whale hunt'' in 1840. Whales were described in narrative literature and paintings, most famously in the novels ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]] and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]]. In the 1882 children's book ''[[Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' by [[Carlo Collodi]], the wooden figure [[Pinocchio]] and his creator Geppetto were swallowed by a whale.\n\nBaleen was used to make vessel components such as the bottom of a bucket in the Scottish National Museum. The [[Norsemen]] crafted ornamented plates from baleen, sometimes interpreted as [[ironing]] boards.\n\nIn the Canadian Arctic (east coast) in Punuk and [[Thule]] culture (1000\u20131600 C.E.),<ref>{{cite journal|title=The circumpolar zone|last1=Cunliffe|first1=B.|last2=Gosden|first2=C.|last3=Joyce|first3=R.|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Archaeology|location=Oxford}}</ref> I baleen was used to construct houses in place of wood as roof support for winter houses, with half of the building buried under the ground.

This change is reflected in films and novels. For example, the protagonist of the series [[Flipper (1995 TV series)|Flipper]] was a bottle-nose dolphin.

[[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic Spotted Dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and rare [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[wolphins]], are kept at [[Sea Life Park]] in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|common]]/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity at [[Discovery Cove]] and [[SeaWorld San Diego]].\n\nIn repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, [[narwhal]]s kept in captivity died within months. A breeding pair of [[pygmy right whale]]s were retained in a netted area. They were eventually released in South Africa. In 1971, SeaWorld captured a California gray whale calf in Mexico at [[Ojo de Liebre Lagoon|Scammon's Lagoon]]. The calf, later named Gigi, was separated from her mother using a form of lasso attached to her flukes. Gigi was displayed at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] for a year. She was then released with a radio beacon affixed to her back; however, contact was lost after three weeks. Gigi was the first captive baleen whale. JJ, another [[gray whale]] calf, was kept at [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. JJ was an orphaned calf that beached itself in April 1997 and was transported two miles to SeaWorld. The {{convert|680|kg|lbs}} calf was a popular attraction and behaved normally, despite separation from his mother. A year later, the then {{convert|8,164.7|kg|lbs}} whale though smaller than average, was too big to keep in captivity, and was released on April 1, 1998.

An Age of Plague 1300\u20131400 }}</ref> It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.\n\nAfter a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.\n\nIt has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342\u20131400) \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}</ref> some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229\u2013331}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\nThe question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.<ref name=\"Pearsall, 8\">Pearsall, 8.</ref> Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.<ref>Cooper, 6\u20147</ref> The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure. \n\nEven the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called \"[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]\"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The most beautiful, on the other hand, is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.<ref>Pearsall, 10, 17.</ref><ref>Cooper, 8.</ref> The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. \n\nIn 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.<ref>Linne R.

Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten \"Fragments\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).<ref name = seven/> Victorians frequently used the nine \"Groups\", which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.<ref name = seven/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:50%\"\n!  width=\"15%\" | Fragment\n!  width=\"5%\"  | Group\n!  width=\"30%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Tales\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">01</span>Fragment I || A\n| \n*[[General Prologue]], \n*[[The Knight's Tale]],\n* [[The Miller's Tale]],\n* [[The Reeve's Tale]],\n* [[The Cook's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">02</span>Fragment II || B<sup>1</sup>\n|\n* [[The Man of Law's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">03</span>Fragment III || D\n|\n* [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]],\n* [[The Friar's Tale]],\n* [[The Summoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">04</span>Fragment IV || E\n|\n* [[The Clerk's Tale]],\n* [[The Merchant's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">05</span>Fragment V || F\n|\n* [[The Squire's Tale]],\n* [[The Franklin's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">06</span>Fragment VI || C\n|\n* [[The Physician's Tale]],\n* [[The Pardoner's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">07</span>Fragment VII || B<sup>2</sup>\n|\n* [[The Shipman's Tale]],\n* [[The Prioress's Tale]],\n* [[Sir Thopas]]' Tale,\n* [[The Tale of Melibee]],\n* [[The Monk's Tale]],\n* [[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">08</span>Fragment VIII || G\n|\n* [[The Second Nun's Tale]],\n* [[The Canon's Yeoman's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">09</span>Fragment IX || H\n|\n* [[The Manciple's Tale]]\n|-\n| <span style=\"display:none\">10</span>Fragment X || I\n|\n* [[The Parson's Tale]]\n|}\n\nAn alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI.

From philological research, we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|\u02c8ka\u02d0r\u0259|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b\u0259r}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kni\u00e7t]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|a\u026a|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' \"weeping\" was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|e\u02d0|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}.

It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen \"master of ceremonies\" to guide them and organise the journey.<ref>Cooper, p. 10.</ref> [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the \"pilgrim\" figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"Harold Bloom\">{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}</ref> New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer\u2019s ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630\u2013660|doi=10.1086/692620}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point,<ref>Cooper, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> while a new study claims he had a copy of the ''Decameron'' and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/971521732|title=Chaucer's ''Decameron'' and the Origin of the Canterbury Tales|last=Biggs|first=Frederick M.|others=D.S. Brewer,|isbn=9781843844754|location=Cambridge|oclc=971521732}}</ref> Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.<ref>Cooper, pp. 12\u201316.</ref> Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].<ref name=\"Brewer227\">Brewer, p. 227.

''There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.'' ''...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?''</ref>{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2017}}<ref>Skeat (1874), p. xxx. '' And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.''</ref>\n\n==Genre and structure==\n[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa]] 1890\u20131900 (retouched from a black & white photograph)]]\n''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story \"collections\" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though \"the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one\".<ref>\"Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales\", 2002, p. 22.</ref> Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.<ref>Cooper, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhile the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.<ref>Cooper, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nLastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.<ref>Cooper, 18.</ref>\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst, c.1400]]\n\nThe variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into \"majestic persuades\", \"temperate pleases\", and \"subdued teaches\". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.<ref name=\"empathy article\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the \"Popet:\" Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.<ref>Cooper, 22\u201324.</ref>\n\nWith this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a \"lady\", while the lower classes use the word \"wenche\", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word \"pitee\", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.<ref>Cooper, 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nChaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].<ref>Cooper, 25\u201326.</ref>\n\n==Historical context and themes==\n[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]\n\n''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.<ref>Cooper, 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nWhile some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.<ref>Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410\u2013417.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].<ref>Bisson, pp. 49\u201351, 56\u201362.</ref> Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.<ref>Bisson, pp. 50.</ref>\n\nTwo characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church \"indulgences\" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.<ref>Bisson, pp. 61\u201364.</ref> Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.<ref>Bisson, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.<ref>Bisson, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]\nChurchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.<ref>Bisson, pp. 73\u201375, 81.</ref> The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.<ref>Bisson, pp. 91\u201395.</ref> [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.<ref>Rubin, 106\u2013107.</ref> The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html \"The Prioress's Tale\"], by Prof. Jane Zatta.</ref>\n\nPilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,<ref>Bisson, pp. 99\u2013102.</ref> but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.<ref>Bisson, pp. 110\u2013113.</ref> The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.<ref>Bisson, pp. 117\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Social class and convention===\n[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma \u2013 he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]\n\nThe upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.<ref>Bisson, pp. 123\u2013131.</ref> Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.<ref>Bisson, pp. 132\u2013134.</ref> Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.<ref>Bisson, pp. 139\u2013142.</ref> Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.<ref>Bisson, pp. 138.</ref> Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'' are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry\u2014the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.<ref>Bisson, pp. 141\u2013142.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being \"those who pray\" (the clergy), \"those who fight\" (the nobility), and \"those who work\" (the commoners and peasantry).<ref>Bisson, pp. 143.</ref> Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some \"quit\" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition \"the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.\"<ref name=opp>Cooper, 19</ref> Several works of the time contained the same opposition.<ref name=opp/>\n\n===Relativism versus realism===\nChaucer's characters each express different\u2014sometimes vastly different\u2014views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, \"Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.\" The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.<ref>Cooper, 21.</ref>\n\n===Liminality===\nThe concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.<ref name=\"empathy article\" /> A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a \u201creal\u201d (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.<ref>Bishop, Norma J. \"Liminal Space in Travellers\u2019 Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).\u201d Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.</ref> The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',\n\n\"Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.\"<ref>Jost, Jean. \u201cUrban and Liminal Space in Chaucer\u2019s Knight\u2019s Tale: Perilous or Protective?\u201d Albrecht Classen, ed.

Print.</ref>\n\nLiminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar\u2019s Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.<ref>Bloomfield, Morton W. \u201cThe \u2018Friar\u2019s Tale\u2019 as a Liminal Tale.\u201d The Chaucer Review 17.4 (1983): 286\u2013291.

Print.</ref>\n\n==Influence on literature==\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries\u2014[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]\u2014also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]\n[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.<ref>Pearsall, 294-5.</ref>\n\nChaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.<ref>Pearsall, 295-97.</ref>\n\n===15th century===\nJohn Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with \"sentence\" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.<ref>Pearsall, 298\u2013302.</ref>\n\n==Literary additions and supplements==\nThe incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.<ref>Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[B\u00e9rinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].<ref>Trigg, pp. 86\u201388, 97.</ref>\n\nJohn Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.<ref>Trigg, pp. 88\u201397.</ref>\n\nThere are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.<ref>Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8\u20139. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.</ref>\n\n''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.<ref>Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264\u2013265. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Literary adaptations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}\n\nMany literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.\n\n[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.\n\nHistorical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.\n\nCanadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.\n\n==Adaptations and homages==\n''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of \"The Knight's Tale\", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath\u2019s Tale, The Pardoner\u2019s Tale and The Nun\u2019s Priest\u2019s Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.\n\n''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.<ref>Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64\u201365. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.<ref>Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland & Co, 2002, pp. 178\u20139. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.</ref>\n\nOn 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened \"The News from Lake Wobegon\" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, \"Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.\"\n\nTelevision adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=BBC \u2013 Drama \u2013 Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |work=[[BBC]] Drama article about the series}}</ref>\n\n{{Panorama |image=File:Canterbury-west-Winter-Highsmith.jpeg |fullwidth=6900 |fullheight=825 |height=165 |caption= [[Ezra Winter]], ''Canterbury Tales'' mural (1939), [[Library of Congress]] [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.

The followers were known as '''Cathars''' and are now mainly remembered for a prolonged period of persecution by the [[Catholic Church]] which did not recognise their belief as Christian.  Catharism appeared in Europe in the [[Languedoc]] region of France in the 11th century and this is when the name first appears. The adherents were also sometimes known as '''Albigensians''' after the city [[Albi]] in southern France where the movement first took hold.  The beliefs are believed to have been brought from [[Persia]] or the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nCathar beliefs varied between communities, because Catharism was initially taught by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] leaders who had set few guidelines. The [[Catholic Church]] denounced its practices including the ''[[Consolamentum]]'' ritual, by which Cathar individuals were baptized and raised to the status of \"[[Cathar Perfect|perfect]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cathars|last=Lambert|first=Malcolm|publisher=Blackwell|year=1998|isbn=0-631-14343-2|location=Oxford|pages=21}}</ref>\n\nCatharism may have had its roots in the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement in [[Armenia]] and eastern [[Byzantine]] Anatolia and certainly in the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]],<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Cathars |title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Peters |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1980 |page=108}}</ref> who were influenced by the Paulicians resettled in [[Thrace]] ([[Plovdiv|Philipopolis]]) by the Byzantines. Though the term ''Cathar'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|\u03b8|\u0251\u02d0|r}}) has been used for centuries to identify the movement, whether the movement identified itself with this name is debatable.{{sfnp|Pegg|2001a|pp=181 ff}} In Cathar texts, the terms ''Good Men'' (''Bons Hommes''), ''Good Women'' (''Bonnes Femmes''), or ''Good Christians'' (''Bons Chr\u00e9tiens'') are the common terms of [[self-identification]].{{sfnp|Th\u00e9ry|2002|pp=75\u2013117}}\n\nThe idea of two gods or principles, one good and the other evil, was central to Cathar beliefs. The good [[God]] was the God of the [[New Testament]] and the creator of the spiritual realm, contrasted with the evil [[Old Testament]] God\u2014the creator of the physical world whom many Cathars, and particularly their persecutors, identified as Satan.<ref>James Wasserman ''The Templars and the Assassins: The Militia of Heaven'' Simon and Schuster 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-594-77873-5}} page</ref> All visible matter, including the human body, was created by this evil god; matter was therefore tainted with [[sin]]. This was antithetical to the monotheistic Catholic Church, whose fundamental principle was that there was only one God, who created all things visible and invisible.<ref>See: [[Nicene Creed]]</ref> Cathars thought human [[spirit]]s were the genderless spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of the evil god, destined to be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] until they achieved salvation through the consolamentum.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}}\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, [[Pope Innocent III]] attempted to end Catharism by sending missionaries and by persuading the local authorities to act against them. In 1208, Innocent's papal legate [[Pierre de Castelnau]] was murdered while returning to [[Rome]] after excommunicating [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond VI of Toulouse]], who, in his view, was too lenient with the Cathars.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=15\u201316}} Pope Innocent III then abandoned the option of sending Catholic [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[jurist]]s, declared Pierre de Castelnau a [[Christian martyrs|martyr]] and launched the [[Albigensian Crusade]] which all but ended Catharism.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfnp|Madaule|1967|pp=56\u201363}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Spread of Paulicanism.png|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[Paulicianism]] and Europe]]\nThe origins of the Cathars' beliefs are unclear, but most theories agree they came from the [[Byzantine Empire]], mostly by the [[trade route]]s and spread from the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] to the Netherlands. The name of [[Bulgarians]] (''Bougres'') was also applied to the Albigensians, and they maintained an association with the similar Christian movement of the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] (\"Friends of God\") of [[Thrace]]. \"That there was a substantial transmission of ritual and ideas from Bogomilism to Catharism is beyond reasonable doubt.\"{{sfnp|Lambert|1998|p=31}} Their doctrines have numerous resemblances to those of the Bogomils and the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], who influenced them,{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=505}} as well as the earlier [[Marcionites]], who were found in the same areas as the Paulicians, the [[Manicheans]] and the Christian [[Gnostics]] of the first few centuries AD, although, as many scholars, most notably [[Mark Gregory Pegg|Mark Pegg]], have pointed out, it would be erroneous to extrapolate direct, historical connections based on theoretical similarities perceived by modern scholars.\n\n[[John Damascene]], writing in the 8th century AD, also notes of an earlier sect called the \"Cathari\", in his book ''On Heresies'', taken from the epitome provided by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in his ''[[Panarion]]''. He says of them: \"They absolutely reject those who marry a second time, and reject the possibility of penance [that is, forgiveness of sins after baptism]\".{{sfnp|John of Damascus|2012|p=125}} These are probably the same Cathari (actually Novations) who are mentioned in Canon 8 of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in the year 325, which states \"...

Conclusions about Cathar ideology continue to be debated with commentators regularly accusing their opponents of speculation, distortion and bias. There are a few texts from the Cathars themselves which were preserved by their opponents (the ''Rituel Cathare de Lyon'') which give a glimpse of the inner workings of their faith, but these still leave many questions unanswered.{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=505}}  One large text which has survived, ''The Book of Two Principles'' (''Liber de duobus principiis''),{{sfnp|Dondaine|1939}} elaborates the principles of dualistic theology from the point of view of some of the [[Albanenses]] Cathars.{{sfnp|Wakefield|Evans|1991|pp=511\u2013515}}\n\n[[File:Routes des ch\u00e2teaux cathares.svg|thumb|left|A map signifying the routes of the Cathar castles (blue squares and lines) in the south of France around the turn of the 13th century]]\n\nIt is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable historical Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld.<ref>See especially [[R.&nbsp;I.

Also see ''Heresies of the High Middle Ages'', a collection of pertinent documents on Western heresies of the High Middle Ages, edited by Walter Wakefield and Austin P. Evans.</ref> A landmark in the \"institutional history\" of the Cathars was the [[Council of Saint-F\u00e9lix|Council]], held in 1167 at [[Saint-F\u00e9lix-Lauragais]], attended by many local figures and also by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] ''papa'' [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop|Nicetas]], the Cathar bishop of [[France|(northern) France]] and a leader of the Cathars of [[Lombardy]].\n\nThe Cathars were largely local, Western European/Latin Christian phenomena, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-[[12th century]], northern [[France]] around the same time, and particularly the [[Languedoc]]\u2014and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern [[Italy]], the Cathars attained their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisitions]] of the fourteenth century finally extirpated them.<ref name=\"Ladurie\">See Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie's ''Montaillou: the Promised Land of Error'' for an analysis of the social context of these last Languedoc Cathars, and ''Power and Purity'' by Carol Lansing for a consideration of 13th-century Catharism in Orvieto.</ref>\n\n==General beliefs==\nCathars, in general, formed an anti-[[sacerdotal]] party in opposition to the pre-Reformation Christian Church, protesting against what they perceived to be the moral, spiritual and political corruption of the church.{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=505}}\n\nWhen [[Folquet de Marselha|Bishop Fulk]] of [[Toulouse]], a key leader of the anti-Cathar persecutions, excoriated the [[Militia of the Faith of Jesus Christ|Languedoc Knights]] for not pursuing the heretics more diligently, he received the reply, \"We cannot. We have been reared in their midst. We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of perfection.\"{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}}\n\n===Sacraments===\nIn contrast to the Catholic Church, the Cathars had but one central rite, the [[Consolamentum]], or Consolation. This involved a brief spiritual ceremony to remove all sin from the believer and to induct him or her into the next higher level as a perfect.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}}\n\nMany believers would receive the Consolamentum as death drew near, performing the ritual of liberation at a moment when the heavy obligations of purity required of Perfecti would be temporally short. Some of those who received the sacrament of the consolamentum upon their death-beds may thereafter have shunned further food or drink and, more often and in addition, expose themselves to extreme cold, in order to speed death.  This has been termed the ''endura''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Suicide in the Middle Ages | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zsw1jJx5t9YC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=endura+cathar| doi =  | isbn = 0-19-820539-2}}</ref> It was claimed by some of the church writers that when a Cathar, after receiving the Consolamentum, began to show signs of recovery he or she would be smothered in order to ensure his or her entry into paradise.

They also refused to partake in the practice of [[Baptism]] by water. The following two quotes are taken from the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]]'s experiences with the Cathar practices and beliefs:\n{{Quote|Then they attack and vituperate, in turn, all the [[sacraments]] of the Church, especially the sacrament of the [[eucharist]], saying that it cannot contain the body of Christ, for had this been as great as the largest mountain Christians would have entirely consumed it before this.

In a world where few could read, their rejection of oath-taking marked them as social outcasts.\n\nTo the Cathars, reproduction was a moral evil to be avoided, as it continued the chain of reincarnation and suffering in the material world. It was claimed by their opponents that, given this loathing for procreation, they generally resorted to [[sodomy]]. Such was the situation that a charge of heresy leveled against a suspected Cathar was usually dismissed if the accused could show he was legally married.\n\n[[File:Berruguete ordeal.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Pedro Berruguete]] portraying the story of a disputation between [[Saint Dominic]] and the Cathars (Albigensians), in which the books of both were thrown on a fire and Dominic's books were miraculously preserved from the flames]]\n\n===Organization===\nIt has been alleged that the Cathar Church of the Languedoc had a relatively [[Flat organization|flat structure]], distinguishing between the baptised ''perfecti'' (a term they did not use; instead, ''bonhommes'') and ordinary unbaptised believers (''credentes'').{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}} By about 1140, liturgy and a system of doctrine had been established.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=49\u201350}} They created a number of [[Episcopal see|bishoprics]], first at [[Albi]] around 1165 {{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=2\u20134}} and after the 1167 Council at [[Saint-F\u00e9lix-Lauragais]] sites at [[Toulouse]], [[Carcassonne]], and [[Agen]], so that four bishoprics were in existence by 1200.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}}{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Lambert|1998|p=70}}{{sfnp|Lambert|2002|p=140}} In about 1225, during a lull in the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the bishopric of [[Raz\u00e8s]] was added.

In this group, women appear to be nearly as numerous as men.]]\n\nCatharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the ''consolamentum.''{{sfnp|Ward|2002|pp=241\u201342}}\n\nCathars believed that one would be repeatedly [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] until one commits to the self-denial of the material world. A man could be reincarnated as a woman and [[Vice-versa|vice versa]], thereby rendering gender meaningless.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=10\u201312}} The spirit was of utmost importance to the Cathars and was described as being [[wikt:Special:Search/immaterial|immaterial]] and [[sex]]less.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=10\u201312}} Because of this belief, the Cathars saw women as equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender as held by the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWomen accused of being [[Heresy|heretics]] in early [[medieval Christianity]] included those labeled [[Gnostics]], Cathars, and [[Beguines]], as well as several other groups that were sometimes \"tortured and executed\".{{sfnp|Clark|2001|p=412}} Cathars, like the Gnostics who preceded them, assigned more importance to the role of [[Mary Magdalene]] in the spread of early [[Christianity]] than the church previously did. Her vital role as a teacher contributed to the Cathar belief that women could serve as spiritual leaders. Women were found to be included in the Perfecti in significant numbers, with numerous receiving the ''consolamentum'' after being widowed.{{sfnp|Ward|2002|pp=241\u201342}} Having reverence for the [[Gospel of John]], the Cathars saw Mary Magdalene as perhaps even more important than [[Saint Peter]], the founder of the church.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe Cathar movement proved successful in gaining female followers because of its [[proto-feminist]] teachings along with the general feeling of exclusion from the Catholic church. Catharism attracted numerous women with the promise of a leadership role that the Catholic Church did not allow.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} Catharism let women become a [[Cathar Perfect|perfect]] of the faith, a position of far more prestige than anything the Catholic Church offered.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=40\u201343}} These female perfects were required to adhere to a strict and ascetic lifestyle, but were still able to have their own houses.{{sfnp|Kaelber|1997|p=120}} Although many women found something attractive in Catharism, not all found its teachings convincing. A notable example is [[Hildegard of Bingen]], who in 1163 gave a widely renowned [[sermon]] against the Cathars in [[Cologne]]. During this speech, Hildegard announced a state of eternal punishment and [[damnation]] to all those who accepted Cathar beliefs.{{sfnp|Newman|1998|pp=753\u2013755}}\n\nWhile women perfects rarely traveled to preach the faith, they still played a vital role in the spreading of the Catharism by establishing group homes for women.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=41}} Though it was extremely uncommon, there were isolated cases of female Cathars leaving their homes to spread the faith.{{sfnp|Weis|2001|p=122}} In Cathar communal homes (ostals), women were educated in the faith, and these women would go on to bear children who would then also become believers. Through this pattern the faith grew [[exponential function|exponentially]] through the efforts of women as each generation passed.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=41}} Among some groups of Cathars there were more women than there were men.{{sfnp|Walther|1965|p=167}}\n\nDespite women having an instrumental role in the growing of the faith, [[misogyny]] was not completely absent from the Cathar movement. Some seemingly misogynistic Cathar beliefs include that one's last [[incarnation]] had to be experienced as a man to break the cycle.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}} This belief was inspired by later French Cathars, which taught that women must be reborn as men in order to achieve [[salvation]].{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} Another one was that the sexual allure of women impeded man's ability to reject the material world.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}} Toward the end of the Cathar movement, Catharism became more misogynistic and started the practice of excluding women perfects.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} However, the influence of these type of misogynistic beliefs and practices remained limited (Later Italian perfects still included women.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}})\n\n==Suppression==\n[[File:Garotte - Excerpt from Pedro Berruguete - Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cathars being burnt at the stake in an ''[[auto-de-f\u00e9]]'' presided over by Saint Dominic, as depicted by [[Pedro Berruguete]]]]\nIn 1147, [[Pope Eugene III]] sent a [[Papal legate|legate]] to the Cathar district in order to arrest the progress of the Cathars. The few isolated successes of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] could not obscure the poor results of this mission, which clearly showed the power of the sect in the Languedoc at that period. The missions of [[Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus]] to Toulouse and the Toulousain in 1178, and of [[Henry of Marcy]], [[cardinal-bishop of Albano]], in 1180\u201381, obtained merely momentary successes.{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=505}} Henry's armed expedition, which took the stronghold at [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], did not extinguish the movement.\n\nDecisions of Catholic Church councils\u2014in particular, those of the Council of [[Tours]] (1163) and of the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] (1179)\u2014had scarcely more effect upon the Cathars. When [[Pope Innocent III]] came to power in 1198, he was resolved to deal with them.{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|pp=505\u2013506}}\n\nAt first Innocent tried peaceful conversion, and sent a number of legates into the Cathar regions. They had to contend not only with the Cathars, the nobles who protected them, and the people who respected them, but also with many of the [[bishop]]s of the region, who resented the considerable authority the [[Pope]] had conferred upon his legates. In 1204, Innocent III suspended a number of bishops in [[Occitania]];{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=506}} in 1205 he appointed a new and vigorous [[bishop of Toulouse]], the former [[troubadour]] [[Folquet de Marselha|Foulques]]. In 1206 [[Diego of Osma]] and his canon, the future [[Saint Dominic]], began a programme of conversion in Languedoc; as part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at [[Verfeil, Haute-Garonne|Verfeil]], [[Servian (commune)|Servian]], [[Pamiers]], [[Montr\u00e9al, Aude|Montr\u00e9al]] and elsewhere.\n\nDominic met and debated with the Cathars in 1203 during his mission to the Languedoc. He concluded that only preachers who displayed real sanctity, humility and asceticism could win over convinced Cathar believers. The institutional Church as a general rule did not possess these spiritual warrants.{{sfnp|Johnson|1976|p=251}} His conviction led eventually to the establishment of the [[Dominican Order]] in 1216. The order was to live up to the terms of his famous rebuke, \"Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth.\" However, even Dominic managed only a few converts among the Cathari.\n\n===Albigensian Crusade===\n{{main article|Albigensian Crusade}}\n{{refimprove section|date = July 2014}}\n[[File:Albigensian Crusade 01.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Pope Innocent III]] excommunicating the Albigensians (left), Massacre against the Albigensians by the crusaders (right)]]\nIn January 1208 the papal legate, [[Pierre de Castelnau]]\u2014a [[Cistercian]] monk, theologian and canon lawyer\u2014was sent to meet the ruler of the area, [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse]].{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=68\u201369}} Known for excommunicating noblemen who protected the Cathars, Castelnau [[excommunicate]]d Raymond for [[abettor|abetting]] heresy following an allegedly fierce argument during which Raymond supposedly threatened Castelnau with violence.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=72\u201373}} Shortly thereafter, Castelnau was murdered as he returned to Rome, allegedly by a knight in the service of Count Raymond. His body was returned and laid to rest in the Abbey at Saint Gilles.\n\nAs soon as he heard of the murder, the Pope ordered the legates to preach a [[Albigensian Crusade|crusade]] against the Cathars and wrote a letter to [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus, King of France]], appealing for his intervention\u2014or an intervention led by his son, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]]. This was not the first appeal but some see the murder of the legate as a turning point in papal policy. Others claim it as a fortuitous event in allowing the Pope to excite popular opinion and to renew his pleas for intervention in the south. The chronicler of the crusade which followed, [[Peter of Vaux de Cernay]], portrays the sequence of events in such a way that, having failed in his effort to peaceably demonstrate the errors of Catharism, the Pope then called a formal crusade, appointing a series of leaders to head the assault.\n\nThe French King refused to lead the crusade himself, and could not spare his son to do so either\u2014despite his victory against [[John, King of England]], there were still pressing issues with Flanders and the empire and the threat of an [[House of Ch\u00e2teaudun|Angevin]] revival. Philip did however sanction the participation of some of his more bellicose and ambitious\u2014some might say dangerous\u2014barons, notably [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] and Bouchard de Marly. There followed twenty years of war against the Cathars and their allies in the Languedoc: the Albigensian Crusade.\n\n[[File:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] today]]\n\nThis war pitted the nobles of France against those of the Languedoc. The widespread northern enthusiasm for the Crusade was partially inspired by a papal decree permitting the confiscation of lands owned by Cathars and their supporters. This not only angered the lords of the south but also the French King, who was at least nominally the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] of the lords whose lands were now open to [[Plunder|despoliation]] and seizure. Philip Augustus wrote to Pope Innocent in strong terms to point this out\u2014but the Pope did not change his policy. As the Languedoc was supposedly teeming with Cathars and Cathar sympathisers, this made the region a target for northern French noblemen looking to acquire new fiefs. The barons of the north headed south to do battle.\n\nTheir first target was the lands of the Trencavel, powerful lords of Carcassonne, B\u00e9ziers, Albi and the Razes. Little was done to form a regional coalition and the crusading army was able to take Carcassonne, the Trencavel capital, incarcerating [[Raymond Roger Trencavel]] in his own citadel where he died within three months; champions of the [[Occitania|Occitan]] cause claimed that he was murdered. Simon de Montfort was granted the Trencavel lands by the Pope and did homage for them to the King of France, thus incurring the enmity of [[Peter II of Aragon]] who had held aloof from the conflict, even acting as a mediator at the time of the siege of Carcassonne. The remainder of the first of the two Cathar wars now focused on Simon's attempt to hold on to his gains through winters where he was faced, with only a small force of confederates operating from the main winter camp at Fanjeaux, with the desertion of local lords who had sworn fealty to him out of necessity\u2014and attempts to enlarge his newfound domains in the summer when his forces were greatly augmented by reinforcements from France, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nSummer campaigns saw him not only retake, sometimes with brutal reprisals, what he had lost in the \"close\" season, but also seek to widen his sphere of operation\u2014and we see him in action in the Aveyron at St. Antonin and on the banks of the Rhone at Beaucaire. Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the [[Battle of Muret]]\u2014a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies\u2014but also the death of Peter of Aragon\u2014and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to de Montfort\u2014and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire. The [[Battle of Muret]] was a massive step in the creation of the unified French kingdom and the country we know today\u2014although Edward III, the Black Prince and Henry V would threaten later to shake these foundations.\n\n===Massacre===\n[[File:Dame guiraude supplice.jpg|thumb|210px|Massacre against the Albigensians by the crusaders]]\nThe crusader army came under the command, both spiritually and militarily, of the [[papal legate]] [[Arnaud-Amaury]], [[Abbot]] of [[C\u00eeteaux]]. In the first significant engagement of the war, the town of [[B\u00e9ziers]] was [[siege|besieged]] on 22 July 1209.  The Catholic inhabitants of the city were granted the freedom to leave unharmed, but many refused and opted to stay and fight alongside the Cathars.\n\nThe Cathars spent much of 1209 fending off the crusaders. The B\u00e9ziers army attempted a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] but was quickly defeated, then pursued by the crusaders back through the gates and into the city. Arnaud-Amaury, the Cistercian abbot-commander, is supposed to have been asked how to tell Cathars from [[Catholics]]. His reply, recalled by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]], a fellow [[Cistercian]], thirty years later was ''\"[[Caedite eos.

What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars' accumulated wealth, which might have included the Holy Grail (see the Section on Historical Scholarship, below).\n\nHunted by the Inquisition and deserted by the nobles of their districts, the Cathars became more and more scattered fugitives: meeting surreptitiously in forests and mountain wilds.

But by this time the Inquisition had grown very powerful. Consequently, many presumed to be Cathars were summoned to appear before it. Precise indications of this are found in the registers of the Inquisitors, [[Bernard of Caux]], [[Jean de St Pierre]], [[Geoffroy d'Ablis]], and others.{{sfnp|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|p=506}} The parfaits it was said only rarely recanted, and hundreds were burnt.

This area is centred around fortresses such as [[Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur|Monts\u00e9gur]] and [[Carcassonne]]; also the French [[departments of France|d\u00e9partement]] of the [[Aude]] uses the title ''Pays Cathare'' in tourist brochures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.payscathare.com/www/contenu/d_payscathare.asp |title=Pays Cathare}}</ref> These areas have ruins from the wars against the Cathars which are still visible today.\n\nSome{{who|date=April 2018}} criticise the promotion of the identity of ''Pays Cathare'' as an exaggeration for [[tourism|tourist]] purposes. Many of the promoted [[Cathar castles]] were not built by Cathars but by local lords and later many of them were rebuilt and extended for strategic purposes.{{or-inline|date=April 2018}} Good examples of these are the magnificent castles of [[Queribus]] and [[Peyrepertuse]] which are both perched on the side of precipitous drops on the last folds of the Corbieres mountains. They were for several hundred years frontier fortresses belonging to the French crown and most of what is still there dates from a post-Cathar era. Many consider the [[County of Foix]] to be the actual historical centre of Catharism.\n\n==Interrogation of heretics==\nIn an effort to find the few remaining heretics in and around the village of [[Montaillou]], Jacques Fournier, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pamiers|Bishop of Pamiers]], future [[Pope Benedict XII]], had those suspected of heresy interrogated in the presence of scribes who recorded their conversations.  The late 13th- to early-14th-century document, discovered in the Vatican archives in the 1960s and edited by [[Jean Duvernoy]], is the basis for [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s work ''[[Montaillou (book)|Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error]]''.<ref name=\"Ladurie\"/>\n\n==Historical scholarship==\nThe publication of the early scholarly book ''Crusade Against the Grail'' by the young German [[Otto Rahn]] in the 1930s rekindled interest in the connection between the Cathars and the [[Holy Grail]], especially in Germany. Rahn was convinced that the 13th-century work ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] was a veiled account of the Cathars.  The philosopher and Nazi government official [[Alfred Rosenberg]] speaks favourably of the Cathars in ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''.<ref name=\"Rosenberg, 1980?\">{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/TheMythOfThe20thCentury/MythOfThe20thCentury#page/n93/mode/2up/search/cathars | title=Myth of the 20th century | date=c. 1980 | accessdate=25 January 2017 | author=Rosenberg, Alfred | pages=93}}</ref>\n\nAcademic books in English first appeared at the beginning of the millennium: for example, Malcolm Lambert's ''The Cathars''{{sfnp|Lambert|1998}} and Malcolm Barber's ''The Cathars''.{{sfnp|Barber|2000}}\n\nStarting in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, historians like [[R.&nbsp;I. Moore]] have radically challenged the extent to which Catharism, as an institutionalized religion, actually existed. Building on the work of French historians such as Monique Zerner and Uwe Brunn, Moore's ''The War on Heresy''<ref>R.&nbsp;I. Moore, ''War on Heresy''. New York: Belknap Press, 2012.</ref> argues that Catharism was \"contrived from the resources of [the] well-stocked imaginations\" of churchmen, \"with occasional reinforcement from miscellaneous and independent manifestations of local anticlericalism or apostolic enthusiasm\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=R.&nbsp;I. |last=Moore |title=L.&nbsp;J.

Moore's work is indicative of a larger [[historiography|historiographical]] trend towards examination of how heresy was constructed by the church.<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Biller |title=review of ''The War on Heresy: Faith and Power in Medieval Europe'', (review no. 1546) |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1546 |access-date=9 October 2015 |website=Reviews in History |postscript=, with R.&nbsp;I. Moore's response.}}</ref>\n\n==In art and music==\nThe principal legacy of the Cathar movement is in the poems and songs of the Cathar [[troubadors]], though this artistic legacy is only a smaller part of the wider [[Occitan]] linguistic and artistic heritage. Recent artistic projects concentrating on the Cathar element in Proven\u00e7al and troubador art include commercial recording projects by Thomas Binkley, electric hurdy-gurdy artist Valentin Clastrier and his CD Heresie dedicated to the church at Cathars,<ref>L'Agonie du Languedoc: Claude Marti / Studio der fr\u00fchen Musik \u2013 Thomas Binkley, dir.

It is produced by the specialised ependymal cells in the [[choroid plexus]]es of the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain, and absorbed in the [[arachnoid granulation]]s. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and [[immunological]] protection to the brain inside the [[Human skull|skull]]. CSF also serves a vital function in [[cerebral autoregulation]] of [[cerebral blood flow]].\n\nCSF occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] (between the [[arachnoid mater]] and the [[pia mater]]) and the [[ventricular system]] around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain, [[subarachnoid cisterns|cisterns]], and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]], as well as the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the [[bony labyrinth]] of the [[inner ear]] via the [[perilymphatic duct]] where the [[perilymph]] is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nA sample of CSF can be taken via [[lumbar puncture]]. This can reveal the [[intracranial pressure]], as well as indicate diseases including [[encephalitis|infections of the brain]] or [[meningitis|its surrounding meninges]]. Although noted by [[Hippocrates]], it was only in the 18th century that [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that [[Harvey W. Cushing]] demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.\n\n==Structure==\n===Circulation===\n[[File:NPH MRI 272 GILD.gif|thumb|MRI showing pulsation of CSF]][[File:dist vent.png|thumb|Distribution of CSF|350x350px]]\n\nThere is about 125-150&nbsp;mL of CSF at any one time.<ref name=\"WRIGHT2012\" /> This CSF circulates within the [[ventricular system]] of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two [[lateral ventricles]]. From here, CSF passes through the [[Interventricular foramina (neuroanatomy)|interventricular foramina]] to the [[third ventricle]], then the [[cerebral aqueduct]] to the [[fourth ventricle]]. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the [[subarachnoid space]] through four openings \u2013 the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord, the [[median aperture]], and the two [[lateral aperture]]s.<ref name=\"WRIGHT2012\" /> CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the [[sacrum]].<ref name=\"WRIGHT2012\" /><ref name=GH2005/> There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the [[bony labyrinth]] of the [[inner ear]] making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the [[perilymph]] in 93% of people.<ref name=\"SAKKA2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Sakka|first1=L.|last2=Coll|first2=G.|last3=Chazal|first3=J.|title=Anatomy and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid|journal=European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases|date=December 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1016/j.anorl.2011.03.002|pmid=22100360}}</ref>\n\nCSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.<ref name=\"SAKKA2011\"/> Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart.<ref name=\"SAKKA2011\"/> Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.<ref name=\"pmc4118619\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Klarica M, Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 D |title=A new look at cerebrospinal fluid movement |journal=Fluids Barriers CNS |volume=11 |issue= |pages= 16|year=2014 |pmc=4118619 |doi=10.1186/2045-8118-11-16 |pmid=25089184}}</ref>\n\n===Contents===\nCSF is derived from [[blood plasma]] and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different [[electrolyte]] levels.

He represents the post-[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] phase of [[structuralism (linguistics)|structuralism]] often referred to as \"distributionalism\" or \"taxonomic structuralism\". His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities.\n\n==Professional and academic career==\n\n===Education===\nAt the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] in [[ancient history]]. While enrolled at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Hockett became interested in the work of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], a leading figure in the field of [[structural linguistics]]. Hockett continued his education at [[Yale University]] where he studied [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] and received his [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in anthropology in 1939. While studying at Yale, Hockett studied with several other influential linguists such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[George P. Murdock]], and [[Benjamin Whorf]]. Hockett's dissertation was based on his fieldwork in [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]]; his paper on Potawatomi [[syntax]] was published in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' in 1939. In 1948 his [[dissertation]] was published as a series in the [[International Journal of American Linguistics]]. Following fieldwork in [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Mexico]], Hockett did two years of [[postdoctoral]] study with [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Michigan]].\n\n===Career===\nHockett began his teaching career in 1946 as an assistant professor of linguistics in the Division of [[Modern Languages]] at [[Cornell University]] where he was responsible for directing the [[Chinese language]] program. In 1957, Hockett became a member of Cornell's anthropology department and continued to teach anthropology and linguistics until he retired to [[emeritus|emeritus status]] in 1982. In 1986, he took up an adjunct post at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where he remained active until his death in 2000.\n\n===Achievements===\nCharles Hockett held membership among many academic institutions such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]]. He served as president of both the [[Linguistic Society of America]] and the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States.\n\nIn addition to making many contributions to the field of [[structural linguistics]], Hockett also considered such things as [[Benjamin Whorf|Whorfian Theory]], [[jokes]], the nature of [[writing systems]], slips of the tongue, and [[animal communication]] and their relativeness to [[speech]].\n\nOutside the realm of linguistics and anthropology, Hockett practiced [[Musical theatre|musical]] performance and [[Musical composition|composition]]. Hockett composed a full-length [[opera]] called ''The Love of Do\u00f1a Rosita'' which was based on a play by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and premiered at [[Ithaca College]] by the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] [[Opera]].\n\nHockett and his wife Shirley were vital leaders in the development of the [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]] Chamber Orchestra in Ithaca, New York. In appreciation of the Hocketts' hard work and dedication to the Ithaca community, Ithaca College established the Charles F. Hockett Music Scholarship, the Shirley and Chas Hockett Chamber Music Concert Series, and the Hockett Family Recital Hall.\n\n==View on linguistics==\nIn his \"Note on Structure\" he argues that [[linguistics]] can be seen as a game and as a science. A linguist as player has a freedom for experimentation on all the utterances of a language, but no criterion to compare his analysis with other linguists. Late in his career, he was known for his stinging criticism of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] linguistics.\n\n==Key contributions==\n\n===American Linguistics===\n\n===Chinese Linguistics===\n\n===Reconciliation of Linguistics with Information theory===\n\n===Criticisms of Noam Chomsky and the Generative Programme===\nAfter carefully examining the generative school's proposed innovations in Linguistics, Hockett decided that this approach was of little value. His book ''The State of the Art'' outlined his criticisms of the generative approach. In his paraphrase a key principle of the Chomskyean paradgim is that there are an infinite number of grammatical sentences in any particular language. \n<blockquote>The grammar of a language is a finite system that characterizes an infinite set of (well-formed) sentences. More specifically, the grammar of a language is a ''well-defined system'' by definition not more powerful than a universal Turing machine (and, in fact, surely a great deal weaker).<ref>''The State of the Art'', p. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe crux of Hockett's rebuttal is that the set of grammatical sentences in a language is not infinite, but rather ill-defined.<ref>p. 52 et passim</ref> Hockett proposes that \"no physical system is well-defined\".<ref>p. 52</ref>\n\nLater in \"Where the tongue slips, there slip I\" he writes as follows. \n<blockquote>\nIt is currently fashionable to assume that, underlying the actual more or less bumbling speech behavior of any human being, there is a subtle and complicated but determinate linguistic \"competence\": a sentence-generating device whose design can only be roughly guessed at by any techniques so far available to us. This point of view makes linguistics very hard and very erudite, so that anyone who actually does discover facts about underlying \"competence\" is entitled to considerable kudos.\n\nWithin this popular frame of reference, a theory of \"performance\" -- of the \"generation of speech\" -- must take more or less the following form. If a sentence is to be uttered aloud, or even thought silently to oneself, it must first be built by the internal \"competence\" of the speaker, the functioning of which is by definition such that the sentence will be legal (\"grammatical\") in every respect. But that is not enough; the sentence as thus constructed must then be ''performed'', either overtly so that others may hear it, or covertly so that it is perceived only by the speaker himself. It is in this second step that blunders may appear. That which is generated by the speaker's internal \"competence\"is what the speaker \"intends to say,\" and is the only real concern of linguistics: blunders in actually performed speech are instructions from elsewhere. Just if there are no such intrusions is what is performed an instance of \"smooth speech\".\n\nI believe this view is unmitigated nonsense, unsupported by any empirical evidence of any sort. In its place, I propose the following.\n\n''All'' speech, smooth as well as blunderful, can be and must be accounted for essentially in terms of the three mechanisms we have listed: analogy, blending, and editing. An individual's language, at a given moment, is a set of habits--that is, of analogies, where different analogies are in conflict, one may appear as a constraint on the working of another. Speech actualizes habits--and changes the habits as it does so. Speech reflects awareness of norms; but norms are themselves entirely a matter of analogy (that is, of habit), not some different kind of thing.<ref>''The View From Language'', pp. 254-255.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDespite his criticisms, Hockett always expressed gratitude to the generative school for seeing real problems in the preexisting approaches. \n\n<blockquote>There are many situations in which bracketing does not serve to disambiguate. As already noted, words that belong together cannot always be spoken together, and when they are not, bracketing is difficult or impossible. In the 1950s this drove some grammarians to drink and other to transformations, but both are only anodynes, not answers<ref>Hockett, Refurbishing our Foundations. John Benjamins, 1987, p. 23</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design features of language===\nOne of Hockett\u2019s most important contributions was his development of the [[Design Features of Language|design-feature]] approach to comparative linguistics. He attempted to distinguish the similarities and differences among [[animal communication]] systems and [[human language]].\n\nHockett initially developed seven features, which were published in the 1959 paper \u201cAnimal \u2018Languages\u2019 and Human Language.\u201d However, after many revisions, he settled on 13 design-features in the ''[[Scientific American]] '' \"The Origin of Speech.\"\n\nHockett argued that while every communication system has some of the 13 design features, only human, spoken language has all 13 features. In turn, that differentiates human spoken language from animal communication and other human communication systems such as [[written language]].\n\n====Hockett's 13 design features of language====\n{{Main|Design Features of Language}}\n#[[Vocal-Auditory Channel]]: Much of human language is performed using the [[vocal]] tract and [[auditory system|auditory]] channel. Hockett viewed this as an advantage for human [[primates]] because it allowed for the ability to participate in other activities while simultaneously communicating through spoken language.\n#[[Broadcast transmission and directional reception]]: All human language can be heard if it is within range of another person\u2019s auditory channel. Additionally, a listener has the ability to determine the source of a sound by [[binaural direction]] finding.\n#[[Rapid Fading (transitoriness)]]: Wave forms of human language dissipate over time and do not persist. A hearer can only receive specific auditory information at the time it is spoken.\n#Interchangeability: A person has the ability to speak and hear the same [[signaling theory|signal]]. Anything that a person is able to hear can be reproduced in spoken language.\n#[[Total Feedback]]: Speakers can hear themselves speak and monitor their [[speech production]] and internalize what they are producing by language.\n#Specialization: Human language sounds are specialized for communication. When dogs pant it is to cool themselves off. When humans speak, it is to transmit information.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Specific signals can be matched with a specific [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].\n#[[Arbitrariness]]: There is no limitation to what can be communicated about and no specific or necessary connection between the sounds used and the message being sent.\n#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: [[Phonemes]] can be placed in distinct categories which differentiate them from one another, like the distinct sound of /p/ versus /b/.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: People can refer to things in space and time and communicate about things that are not present.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: People can create new and unique meanings of utterances from previously existing utterances and sounds.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]: Human language is not completely [[innate]], and acquisition depends in part on the learning of a language.\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Meaningless phonic segments ([[phoneme]]s) are combined to make meaningful words, which, in turn, are combined again to make sentences.\n\nWhile Hockett believed that all communication systems, animal and human alike, share many of these features, only human language contains all 13 design features. Additionally, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]] are key to human language.\n\n====Hockett's design features and their implications for human language====\n#Hockett suggests that the importance of a vocal-auditory channel lies in the fact that the animal can communicate while also performing other tasks, such as eating, or using tools.\n#[[Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception]]: An auditory|audible human language signal is sent out in all directions but is perceived in a limited direction. For example, humans are more proficient in determining the location of a sound source when the sound is projecting directly in front of them, as opposed to a sound source projected directly behind them.\n#[[Rapid Fading]] of a signal in human communication differs from such things as animal tracks and written language because an utterance does not continue to exist after it has been broadcast. With that in mind, it is important to note that Hockett viewed spoken language as the primary concern for investigation. Written language was seen as being secondary because of its recent evolution in culture.\n#Interchangeability represents a human's ability to act out or reproduce any linguistic message that they are able to comprehend. That differs from many animal communication systems, particularly in regards to mating. For example, humans have the ability to say and do anything that they feel may benefit them in attracting a mate. [[Stickleback]]s, on the other hand, have different male and female courtship motions; a male cannot replicate a female's motions and vice versa.\n#[[Total Feedback]] is important in differentiating a human's ability to internalize their own productions of speech and behavior. That design-feature incorporates the idea that humans have insight into their actions.\n#Specialization is apparent in the anatomy of human [[speech organs]] and our ability to exhibit some control over these organs. For example, a key assumption in the evolution of language is that the descent of the [[larynx]] has allowed humans to produce speech sounds. Additionally, in terms of control, humans are generally able to control the movements of their tongue and mouth. Dogs however, do not have control over these organs. When dogs pant they are communicating a signal, but the panting is an uncontrollable response reflex of being hot [https://web.archive.org/web/20080709091601/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/psychology/rmk/Readings/Hockett.pdf].\n#[[Semanticity]]: A specific signal can be matched with a specific meaning within a particular language system. For example, all people who understand [[English language|English]] have the ability to make a connection between a specific word and what that word represents or refers to. (Hockett notes that [[gibbon]]s also show semanticity in their signals, but their calls are far more broad than human language.)\n#[[Arbitrariness]] within human language suggests that there is no direct connection between the type of signal (word) and what is being referenced. For example, an animal as large as a cow can be referred to by a very short word {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027014002/http://www.geocities.com/pkd_du/dfhl.htm |date=October 27, 2009 }}.\n#[[Discrete mathematics|Discreteness]]: Each basic unit of speech can be categorized and is distinct from other categories. In human language, there are only a small set of sound ranges that are used and the differences between these bits of sound are absolute. In contrast, the [[waggle dance]] of [[honey bee]]s is continuous.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]] refers to the human language system's ability to communicate about things that are not present spatially, temporally, or realistically. For example, humans have the ability to communicate about unicorns and outer space.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: Human language is open and productive in the sense that humans have the ability to say things that have never before been spoken or heard. In contrast, apes such as the gibbon have a closed communication system because all of their vocal sounds are part of a finite repertoire of familiar calls.\n#[[Traditional Transmission]]:: suggests that while certain aspects of [[language]] may be [[innate]], humans acquire words and their [[native language]] from other speakers. That is different from many [[animal communication]] systems because most animals are born with the [[innate]] [[knowledge]], and [[skills]] necessary for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. ([[Honey bee]]s have an inborn ability to perform and understand the [[waggle dance]]).\n#[[Duality of patterning]]: Humans have the ability to recombine a finite set of [[phoneme]]s to create an infinite number of words, which, in turn, can be combined to make an unlimited number of different sentences.\n\n====Design feature representation in other communication systems====\n;Honeybees\n\nForaging [[honey bee]]s communicate with other members of their hive when they have discovered a relevant source of [[pollen]], [[nectar]], or water. In an effort to convey information about the location and the distance of such resources, honeybees participate in a particular figure-eight dance known as the [[waggle dance]].\n\nIn Hockett's \"The Origin of Speech\", he determined that the honeybee communication system of the [[waggle dance]] holds the following [[Design Features of Language|design features]]:\n\n#Broadcast Transmission and Directional Reception: By the use of this dance, honeybees are able to send out a signal that informs other members of the hive as to what direction the source of food, or water can be located.\n#[[Semanticity]]: Evidence that the specific signals of a communication system can be matched with specific meanings is apparent because other members of the hive are able to locate the food source after a performance of the waggle dance.\n#[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]: Foraging honeybees can communicate about a resource that is not currently present within the hive.\n#[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]: [[Waggle dance]]s change based on the direction, amount, and type of resource.\n\nGibbons are small apes in the family Hylobatidae. While they share the same [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], and [[order (biology)|order]] of humans and are relatively close to man, Hockett distinguishes between the gibbon communication system and human language by noting that gibbons are devoid of the last four design features.\n\nGibbons possess the first nine [[Design Features of Language|design features]], but do not possess the last four (displacement, productivity, [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]], and [[duality of patterning]]).\n\n#Displacement, according to Hockett, appears to be lacking in the vocal [[Signalling theory|signal]]ing of apes.\n#Productivity does not exist among gibbons because if any vocal sound is produced, it is one of a finite set of repetitive and familiar calls.\n#Hockett supports the idea that humans learn language extra genetically through the process of [[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]. Hockett distinguishes gibbons from humans by stating that despite any similarities in communication among a species of apes, one cannot attribute these similarities to acquisition through the teaching and learning ([[Traditional Transmission|traditional transmission]]) of signals; the only explanation must be a genetic basis.\n#Finally, [[duality of patterning]] explains a human's ability to create multiple [[meanings (linguistics)|meanings]] from somewhat meaningless sounds. For example, the [[phonemes]]s /t/, /a/, /c/ can be used to create the words \"cat,\" \"tack,\" and \"act.\" Hockett states that no other [[Hominoid]] communication system besides human language maintains this ability.\n\n===Later additions to the features===\nIn a report published in 1968 with anthropologist and scientist Stuart A. Altmann, Hockett derived three more [[Design Features of Language|Design Features]], bringing the total to 16. These are the additional three:\n\n#<li value=14> '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''': A speaker can say falsehoods, lies, and meaningless statements.\n# '''Reflexiveness''': Language can be used communicate about the very system it is, and language can discuss language\n# '''[[Learnability]]''': A speaker of a language can learn another language\n\n====Other additions====\nCognitive scientist and linguist at the University of Sussex [[Larry Trask]] offered an alternative term and definition for number 14, '''[[Deception|Prevarication]]''':\n:14. (a) '''Stimulus Freedom''': One can choose to say anything nothing in any given situation\n\nThere has since been one more Feature added to the list, by [https://web.archive.org/web/20100612132306/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/anth/People/FacStaff/faculty/wstuart/index.html Dr. William Taft Stuart], a director of the Undergraduate Studies program at the University of Maryland: College Park\u2019s Anthropology school, part of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. His \u201cextra\u201d Feature is:\n\n:17. '''Grammaticality''': A speaker\u2019s sayings conform to the rules of grammar\n\nThis follows the definition of Grammar and Syntax, as given by Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary:\n\n:'''[[Grammar]]''':\n::1. (a) the study of the classes of words, their inflections, and their functions and relations in the sentence (b) a study of what is to be preferred and what avoided in inflection and syntax\n\n::2. (a) the characteristic system of inflections and syntax of a language (b) a system of rules that defines the grammatical structure of a language\n\n:'''[[Syntax]]''':\n::1. (a) the way in which linguistic elements (as words) are put together to form constituents (as phrases or clauses) (b) the part of grammar\n\n====Relationship between design features and animal communication====\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Stuart defends his postulation with references to famous linguist Noam Chomsky and University of New York psychologist Gary Marcus. Chomsky theorized that humans are unique in the animal world because of their ability to utilize Design Feature 5: Total Feedback, or recursive grammar. This includes being able to correct oneself and insert explanatory or even non sequitur statements into a sentence, without breaking stride, and keeping proper grammar throughout.\n\nWhile there have been studies attempting to disprove Chomsky, Marcus states that, \"An intriguing possibility is that the capacity to recognize recursion might be found only in species that can acquire new patterns of vocalization, for example, songbirds, humans and perhaps some cetaceans.\" This is in response to a [http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/04/26/birds-grammar060426.html study performed] by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentner\u2019s study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify \u201codd\u201d statements within a given \u201csong.\u201d However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomsky\u2019s observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.\n\n[http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~johnson/articles.chimp.html There is also thought] that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding \u201chumans\u201d would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us, \ntoday.\n\n=====Hockett's \"design features\" of language and other animal communication systems=====\n\nThe [http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/design_features.htm [[University of Oxford]]]: Phonetics Laboratory Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics published the following chart, detailing how Hockett's (and Altmann's) Design Features fit into other forms of communication, in animals:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence is significantly so on its own. Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence of evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not likely be a strong [[scientific consensus]].\n\nThe principle is based on the [[unity of knowledge]]; measuring the same result by several different methods should lead to the same answer. For example, it should not matter whether one measures the distance between the [[Giza pyramid complex]] by [[Laser rangefinder|laser rangefinding]], by [[satellite imaging]], or with a [[meter stick]] \u2013 in all three cases, the answer should be approximately the same. For the same reason, different dating methods in [[geochronology]] should concur, a result in [[chemistry]] should not contradict a result in [[geology]], etc.\n\nThe word ''consilience'' was originally coined as the phrase \"consilience of inductions\" by [[William Whewell]] (\"consilience\" refers to a \"jumping together\" of knowledge).<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O|title= Consilience: the unity of knowledge|year=1998|publisher=[[Alfred A.

Accessed: 17 October 2015.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nConsilience requires the use of independent methods of measurement, meaning that the methods have few shared characteristics. That is, the mechanism by which the measurement is made is different; each method is dependent on an unrelated natural phenomenon. For example, the accuracy of laser rangefinding measurements is based on the scientific understanding of [[laser]]s, while satellite pictures and meter sticks rely on different phenomena. Because the methods are independent, when one of several methods is in error, it is very unlikely to be in error in the ''same way'' as any of the other methods, and a difference between the measurements will be observed.<ref group=note>Note that this is not the same as performing the same measurement several times. While repetition does provide evidence because it shows that the measurement is being performed consistently, it would not be consilience and would be more vulnerable to error.</ref> If the scientific understanding of the properties of lasers were inaccurate, then the laser measurement would be inaccurate but the others would not.\n\nAs a result, when several different methods agree, this is strong evidence that ''none'' of the methods are in error and the conclusion is correct. This is because of a greatly reduced likelihood of errors: for a consensus estimate from multiple measurements to be wrong, the errors would have to be similar for all samples and all methods of measurement, which is extremely unlikely. [[Random errors]] will tend to cancel out as more measurements are made, due to [[regression to the mean]]; [[systematic errors]] will be detected by differences between the measurements (and will also tend to cancel out since the direction of the error will still be random). This is how [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] reach high confidence \u2013 over time, they build up a large degree of evidence which converges on the same conclusion.<ref group=note>Statistically, if three different tests are each 90% reliable when they give a positive result, a positive result from all three tests would be 99.9% reliable; five such tests would be 99.999% reliable, and so forth. This requires the tests to be [[statistically independent]], analogous to the requirement for independence in the methods of measurement.</ref>\n\nWhen results from different strong methods do appear to conflict, this is treated as a serious problem to be reconciled. For example, in the 19th century, the [[Sun]] appeared to be no more than 20 million years old, but the Earth appeared to be no less than 300 million years (resolved by the discovery of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[radioactivity]], and the theory of [[quantum mechanics]]);<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/#1 John N. Bahcall, nobelprize.org]</ref> or current attempts to resolve theoretical differences between quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]].<ref name=Weinberg>\n{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first= S|year=1993|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|publisher=Vintage Books, New York}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nBecause of consilience, the strength of evidence for any particular conclusion is related to how many independent methods are supporting the conclusion, as well as how different these methods are. Those techniques with the fewest (or no) shared characteristics provide the strongest consilience and result in the strongest conclusions. This also means that confidence is usually strongest when considering evidence from different fields, because the techniques are usually very different.\n\nFor example, the theory of [[evolution]] is supported by a convergence of evidence from [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[geology]], [[biogeography]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[comparative physiology]], and many other fields.<ref name=\"SciAm\">''Scientific American'', March 2005. \"The Fossil Fallacy.\" [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-fossil-fallacy Link.]</ref> In fact, the evidence within each of these fields is itself a convergence providing evidence for the theory. (As a result, to disprove evolution, most or all of these independent lines of evidence would have to be found to be in error.<ref name=\"Shermer\" />) The strength of the evidence, considered together as a whole, results in the strong scientific consensus that the theory is correct.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/> In a similar way, evidence about the [[history of the universe]] is drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, planetary geology, and physics.<ref name=\"Shermer\" />\n\nFinding similar conclusions from multiple independent methods is also evidence for the reliability of the methods themselves, because consilience eliminates the possibility of all potential errors that do not affect all the methods equally. This is also used for the validation of new techniques through comparison with the consilient ones. If only partial consilience is observed, this allows for the detection of errors in methodology; any weaknesses in one technique can be compensated for by the strengths of the others. Alternatively, if using more than one or two techniques for every experiment is infeasible, some of the benefits of consilience may still be obtained if it is well-established that these techniques usually give the same result.\n\nConsilience is important across all of science, including the social sciences,<ref>For example, in linguistics: see ''Converging Evidence: Methodological and theoretical issues for linguistic research, edited by Doris Schonefeld.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nGKT-2VwO0UC&pg=PT92&dq=Converging+Evidence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ipfuT_jrOIjpqAHnrp2OAg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Converging%20Evidence&f=false Link.]</ref> and is often used as an argument for [[scientific realism]] by philosophers of science. Each branch of science studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. [[Atomic physics]] underlies the workings of [[chemistry]], which studies [[emergence|emergent]] properties that in turn are the basis of [[biology]]. [[Psychology]] is not separate from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s. [[Sociology]], [[economics]], and [[anthropology]] are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans. The concept that all the different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why scientific knowledge determined in one field of inquiry has often helped in understanding other fields.\n\n==Deviations==\n\nConsilience does not forbid deviations: in fact, since not all experiments are perfect, some deviations from established knowledge are expected. However, when the convergence is strong enough, then new evidence inconsistent with the previous conclusion is not usually enough to outweigh that convergence. Without an equally strong convergence on the new result, the weight of evidence will still favor the established result. This means that the new evidence is most likely to be wrong.\n\nScience [[denialism]] (for example, [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]]) is often based on a misunderstanding of this property of consilience. A denier may promote small gaps not yet accounted for by the consilient evidence, or small amounts of evidence contradicting a conclusion without accounting for the pre-existing strength resulting from consilience. More generally, to insist that all evidence converge precisely with no deviations would be na\u00efve falsificationism,<ref name=\"Lakatos\">For example, see [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Lakatos-Falsification.pdf Imre Lakatos.], in ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'' (1970).</ref> equivalent to considering a single contrary result to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] a theory when another explanation, such as equipment malfunction or misinterpretation of results, is much more likely.<ref name=\"Lakatos\"/><ref group=note>More generally, anything which results in a false positive or false negative.</ref>\n\n==In history==\n\nHistorical evidence also converges in an analogous way. For example: if five ancient historians, none of whom knew each other, all claim that [[Julius Caesar]] seized power in Rome in 49 BCE, this is strong evidence in favor of that event occurring even if each individual historian is only partially reliable. By contrast, if the same historian had made the same claim five times in five different places (and no other types of evidence were available), the claim is much weaker because it originates from a single source. The evidence from the ancient historians could also converge with evidence from other fields, such as archaeology: for example, evidence that many senators fled Rome at the time, that the battles of [[Caesar\u2019s civil war]] occurred, and so forth.\n\nConsilience has also been discussed in reference to [[Holocaust denial]]. \n{{quote|\"We [have now discussed] eighteen proofs all converging on one conclusion...the deniers shift the burden of proof to historians by demanding that ''each'' piece of evidence, independently and without corroboration between them, prove the Holocaust. Yet no historian has ever claimed that one piece of evidence proves the Holocaust. We must examine the collective whole.\"<ref name=\"Shermer\" />}}\n\nThat is, individually the evidence may underdetermine the conclusion, but together they overdetermine it. A similar way to state this is that to ask for one ''particular'' piece of evidence in favor of a conclusion is a flawed question.<ref name=\"SciAm\"/><ref name=\"Shermer2\">{{cite book|first=Michael|last= Shermer|year=2002|title=In Darwin\u2019s Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace|page=319|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSSkPqmbeXIC}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the sciences==\n\nIn addition to the sciences, consilience can be important to [[the arts]], [[ethics]] and [[religion]]. Both artists and scientists have identified the importance of biology in the process of artistic innovation.<ref name=Wilson />\n\n==History of the concept==\nConsilience has its roots in the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek concept]] of an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] orderliness that governs our [[cosmos]], inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with [[mystical]] views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The [[Rationality|rational]] view was recovered during the high [[Middle Ages]], separated from [[theology]] during the [[Renaissance]] and found its apogee in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\nWhewell\u2019s definition was that:<ref name=\"Whewell\">{{cite book|first=William|last= Whewell|year=1840|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History|publisher=London: John W.

Thus Consilience is a test of the truth of the Theory in which it occurs.}}\n\nMore recent descriptions include:\n{{quote|\"Where there is convergence of evidence, where the same explanation is implied, there is increased confidence in the explanation. Where there is divergence, then either the explanation is at fault or one or more of the sources of information is in error or requires reinterpretation.\"<ref>''A Companion to the Philosophy of History and Historiography'', section 28. Aviezer Tucker (editor).</ref>}}\n{{quote|\"Proof is derived through a convergence of evidence from numerous lines of inquiry--multiple, independent inductions, all of which point to an unmistakable conclusion.\"<ref name=\"SciAm\"/>}}\n\n==Edward O. Wilson==\nAlthough the concept of consilience in Whewell's sense was widely discussed by philosophers of science, the term was unfamiliar to the broader public until the end of the 20th century, when it was revived in ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]],'' a 1998 book by the humanist biologist [[Edward Osborne Wilson]], as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures|The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\nWilson held that with the rise of the [[modern science]]s, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. He asserted that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers \"a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws.\" And important point made by Wilson is that hereditary human nature and evolution itself profoundly effect the evolution of culture, in essence a sociobiological concept. Wilson's concept is a much broader notion of consilience than that of Whewell, who was merely pointing out that generalizations invented to account for one set of phenomena often account for others as well.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\nA parallel view lies in the term [[universology]], which literally means \"the science of the universe.\" Universology was first promoted for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a 19th-century utopian futurist and anarchist.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Argument from authority|Appeal to authority}}\n* {{annotated link|Appeal to tradition}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science#Coherentism}}\n* {{annotated link|Equifinality}}\n* {{annotated link|Scientific method}}\n* {{annotated link|Syncretism}}\n* {{annotated link|Tree of knowledge system}}\n* {{annotated link|Unified Science}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|consilience}}\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/bookauth/ba980318.htm A conversation with Edward O.

They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, encouraging parties to explore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable outcome.\n\nConciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award.\n\nConciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that in conciliation, often the parties are in need of restoring or repairing a relationship, either personal or business.\n\n== Conciliation Technique ==\nA conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to \"give\" on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn. The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.\n\nMost successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (United States)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]] in the United States.\n\n==Historical conciliation==\nHistorical conciliation is an applied conflict resolution approach that utilizes historical [[narratives]] to positively transform relations between societies in conflicts. Historical conciliation can utilize many different methodologies, including [[mediation]], [[Sustained Dialogue|sustained dialogue]], apologies, acknowledgement, support of public commemoration activities, and public diplomacy.\n\nHistorical conciliation is not an excavation of objective facts. The point of facilitating historical questions is not to discover all the facts in regard to who was right or wrong. Rather, the objective is to discover the complexity, ambiguity, and emotions surrounding both dominant and non-dominant cultural and individual narratives of history. It is also not a rewriting of history. The goal is not to create a combined narrative that everyone agrees upon. Instead, the aim is to create room for critical thinking and more inclusive understanding of the past and conceptions of \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\nConflicts that are addressed through historical conciliation have their roots in conflicting [[Identity (social science)|identities]] of the people involved. Whether the identity at stake is their ethnicity, religion or culture, it requires a comprehensive approach that takes people\u2019s needs, hopes, fears, and concerns into account.\n\n==Japan==\n[[Japan]]ese law makes extensive use of {{nihongo|conciliation|\u8abf\u505c|ch\u014dtei}} in civil disputes. The most common forms are civil conciliation and domestic conciliation, both of which are managed under the auspice of the court system by one judge and two non-judge \"conciliators.\"\n\nCivil conciliation is a form of dispute resolution for small lawsuits, and provides a simpler and cheaper alternative to litigation. Depending on the nature of the case, non-judge experts (doctors, appraisers, actuaries, and so on) may be called by the court as conciliators to help decide the case.\n\nDomestic conciliation is most commonly used to handle contentious [[divorce]]s, but may apply to other domestic disputes such as the annulment of a marriage or acknowledgment of paternity. Parties in such cases are required to undergo conciliation proceedings and may only bring their case to court once conciliation has failed.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Dispute resolution]]\n\n[[pl:Ugoda]]", "sha1": "l4d2szjownu6izzlw5n5psx9vregeit"}}, {"title": "Colin Fulcher", "ns": "0", "id": "7644", "redirect": {"title": "Barney Bubbles"}, "revision": {"id": "528729757", "parentid": "15905704", "timestamp": "2012-12-19T01:50:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Barney Bubbles]]", "sha1": "jdfv509xjbpdh6yoh80e0hscyic6h3n"}}, {"title": "Cyclone (programming language)", "ns": "0", "id": "7645", "revision": {"id": "854209524", "parentid": "852481470", "timestamp": "2018-08-09T18:01:30Z", "contributor": {"ip": "131.107.147.179"}, "comment": "/* Pointer types */ Fix example", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox programming language\n | name                   = Cyclone\n | logo                   =\n | caption                =\n | file ext               =\n | paradigm               =\n | released               = {{start date|2002}}\n | designer               = AT&T Labs\n | developer              =\n | latest release version = 1.0\n | latest release date    = {{start date and age|2006|05|08}}\n | latest preview version =\n | latest preview date    = <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n | typing                 =\n | implementations        =\n | dialects               =\n | influenced by          = [[C (programming language)|C]]\n | influenced             = [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]]\n | programming language   =\n | operating system       =\n | license                =\n | website                = {{URL|http://cyclone.thelanguage.org}}\n | wikibooks              =\n | discontinued           = yes\n}}\nThe '''Cyclone''' [[programming language]] is intended to be a safe dialect of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. Cyclone is designed to avoid [[buffer overflow]]s and other vulnerabilities that are possible in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for [[system programming]].\n\nCyclone development was started as a joint project of AT&T Labs Research and [[Greg Morrisett]]'s group at Cornell in 2001. Version 1.0 was released on May 8, 2006.\n\n==Language features==\nCyclone attempts to avoid some of the common pitfalls of [[C (programming language)|C]], while still maintaining its look and performance. To this end, Cyclone places the following limits on programs:\n* <code>[[Null pointer|NULL]]</code> checks are inserted to prevent [[segmentation fault]]s\n* [[Pointer arithmetic]] is limited\n* Pointers must be initialized before use (this is enforced by [[definite assignment analysis]])\n* [[Dangling pointer]]s are prevented through region analysis and limits on [[Malloc|<code>free()</code>]]\n* Only \"safe\" casts and unions are allowed\n* [[Control flow|<code>goto</code>]] into scopes is disallowed\n* [[Control flow|<code>switch</code>]] labels in different scopes are disallowed\n* Pointer-returning functions must execute <code>return</code>\n* [[Setjmp/longjmp|<code>setjmp</code>]] and [[Setjmp/longjmp|<code>longjmp</code>]] are not supported\n\nTo maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:\n* '''Never-<code>NULL</code> pointers''' do not require <code>NULL</code> checks\n* '''\"Fat\" pointers''' support pointer arithmetic with run-time [[bounds checking]]\n* '''Growable regions''' support a form of safe manual memory management\n* '''[[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]]''' for heap-allocated values\n* '''[[Tagged union]]s''' support type-varying arguments\n* '''Injections''' help automate the use of tagged unions for programmers\n* '''[[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]''' replaces some uses of [[void pointer|<code>void *</code>]]\n* '''varargs''' are implemented as fat pointers\n* '''[[Exception handling|Exceptions]]''' replace some uses of <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>\n\nFor a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, see [http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/cyclone/papers/cyclone-safety.pdf this paper].\n\nCyclone looks, in general, much like [[C (programming language)|C]], but it should be viewed as a C-like language.\n\n===Pointer types===\nCyclone implements three kinds of [[pointer (computer science)|pointer]]:\n* <code>*</code> (the normal type)\n* <code>@</code> (the never-<code>NULL</code> pointer), and\n* <code>?</code> (the only type with [[pointer arithmetic]] allowed, [[fat pointer|\"fat\" pointer]]s).\nThe purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers. Take for instance a function, called <code>foo</code> that takes a pointer to an int:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n int foo(int *);\n</source>\nAlthough the person who wrote the function <code>foo</code> could have inserted <code>NULL</code> checks, let us assume that for performance reasons they did not. Calling <code>foo(NULL);</code> will result in [[undefined behavior]] (typically, although not necessarily, a [[SIGSEGV]] [[Unix signal|signal]] being sent to the application). To avoid such problems, Cyclone introduces the <code>@</code> pointer type, which can never be <code>NULL</code>. Thus, the \"safe\" version of <code>foo</code> would be:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n int foo(int @);\n</source>\nThis tells the Cyclone compiler that the argument to <code>foo</code> should never be <code>NULL</code>, avoiding the aforementioned undefined behavior. The simple change of <code>*</code> to <code>@</code> saves the programmer from having to write <code>NULL</code> checks and the operating system from having to trap <code>NULL</code> pointer dereferences.  This extra limit, however, can be a rather large stumbling block for most C programmers, who are used to being able to manipulate their pointers directly with arithmetic. Although this is desirable, it can lead to [[buffer overflow]]s and other \"off-by-one\"-style mistakes. To avoid this, the <code>?</code> pointer type is delimited by a known bound, the size of the array. Although this adds overhead due to the extra information stored about the pointer, it improves safety and security. Take for instance a simple (and na\u00efve) <code>strlen</code> function, written in C:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n int strlen(const char *s)\n {\n     int iter = 0;\n     if (s == NULL)\n        return 0;\n     while (s[iter] != '\\0') {\n        iter++;\n     }\n     return iter;\n }\n</source>\nThis function assumes that the string being passed in is terminated by NULL (<code>'\\0'</code>). However, what would happen if <code>char&nbsp;buf[6]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{'h','e','l','l','o','!'};</code> were passed to this string? This is perfectly legal in C, yet would cause <code>strlen</code> to iterate through memory not necessarily associated with the string <code>s</code>. There are functions, such as <code>strnlen</code> which can be used to avoid such problems, but these functions are not standard with every implementation of [[ANSI C]]. The Cyclone version of <code>strlen</code> is not so different from the C version:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n int strlen(const char ? s)\n {\n    int iter, n = s.size;\n    if (s == NULL)\n       return 0;\n    for (iter = 0; iter < n; iter++, s++) {\n       if (*s == '\\0')\n          return iter;\n    }\n    return n;\n }\n</source>\nHere, <code>strlen</code> bounds itself by the length of the array passed to it, thus not going over the actual length. Each of the kinds of pointer type can be safely cast to each of the others, and arrays and strings are automatically cast to <code>?</code> by the compiler. (Casting from <code>?</code> to <code>*</code> invokes a [[bounds checking|bounds check]], and casting from <code>?</code> to <code>@</code> invokes both a <code>NULL</code> check and a bounds check. Casting from <code>*</code> to <code>?</code> results in no checks whatsoever; the resulting <code>?</code> pointer has a size of 1.)\n\n===Dangling pointers and region analysis===\nConsider the following code, in C:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n char *itoa(int i)\n {\n    char buf[20];\n    sprintf(buf,\"%d\",i);\n    return buf;\n }\n</source>\nFunction <code>itoa</code> allocates an array of chars <code>buf</code> on the stack and returns a pointer to the start of <code>buf</code>. However the memory used on the stack for <code>buf</code> is deallocated when the function returns, so the returned value cannot be used safely outside of the function. While [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] and other compilers will warn about such code, the following will typically compile without warnings:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n char *itoa(int i)\n {\n    char buf[20], *z;\n    sprintf(buf,\"%d\",i);\n    z = buf;\n    return z;\n }\n</source>\n[[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] can produce warnings for such code as a side-effect of option -O2 or -O3, but there are no guarantees that all such errors will be detected.\nCyclone does regional analysis of each segment of code, preventing dangling pointers, such as the one returned from this version of <code>itoa</code>. All of the local variables in a given scope are considered to be part of the same region, separate from the heap or any other local region. Thus, when analyzing <code>itoa</code>, the Cyclone compiler would see that <code>z</code> is a pointer into the local stack, and would report an error.\n\n==See also==\n* [[C (programming language)|C]]\n* [[ML (programming language)|ML]]\n* [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]]\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=August 2015}}\n* [http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/User%20Manual Cyclone User Manual]\n* [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/cyclone-cuj.pdf Cyclone: a Type-safe Dialect of C] by Dan Grossman, Michael Hicks, Trevor Jim, and Greg Morrisett - published January 2005\n\n==External links==\n* [http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/ Cyclone Homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111227232825/http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~greg/cyclone/old_cyclone.html Old web site] since official web site is not available.\n* [http://math.ifi.uzh.ch/fedora/5/i386/SRPMS.gemi/cyclone-1.0-1.src.rpm Cyclone 1.0 source code RPM]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* [http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Download Cyclone - Source code repositories]\n* [http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions Cyclone - FAQ]\n* [http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Cyclone%20for%20C%20Programmers Cyclone for C programmers]\n\nPresentations:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607170455/http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/rej/morrisett-4.2.03.ppt Cyclone:  A Type-Safe Dialect of C]\n* [http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/djg/slides/grossman_cyclone_jpl_05.ppt Cyclone: A Memory-Safe C-Level Programming Language]\n\n{{CProLang}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cyclone (Programming Language)}}\n[[Category:C programming language family]]", "sha1": "mshcnvj79itm30ahu2w581bteseundb"}}, {"title": "Cognitivism", "ns": "0", "id": "7646", "revision": {"id": "754408297", "parentid": "609623497", "timestamp": "2016-12-12T14:01:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "JHunterJ", "id": "842922"}, "comment": "Disambiguation style repair", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Cognitivism''' may refer to:\n* [[Cognitivism (ethics)]], the philosophical view that ethical sentences express propositions and are capable of being true or false\n* [[Cognitivism (psychology)]], a psychological approach that argues that mental function can be understood as the internal manipulation of symbols\n* [[Cognitivism (aesthetics)]], a view that cognitive psychology can help understand art and the response to it\n* [[Anecdotal cognitivism]], a psychological methodology for interpreting animal behavior in terms of mental states\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cognition]], the study of the human mind\n* [[Cognitive anthropology]]\n* [[Cognitive science]]\n* [[Computationalism]]\n* [[Philosophy of mind]]\n* [[Situated cognition]]\n* [[Socio-cognitive]]\n* [[Symbol grounding]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "e6hsbyy15vov0grlijyy1eg5itgp7z4"}}, {"title": "Counter (digital)", "ns": "0", "id": "7647", "revision": {"id": "863729302", "parentid": "863554383", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T16:50:15Z", "contributor": {"username": "G\u00fcnniX", "id": "237572"}, "comment": "Reverted vandalism by 27.97.18.193", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the term counter used in electronics, computing, and mechanical counting devices||Counter (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[digital logic]] and [[computing]], a '''counter''' is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular [[event (philosophy)|event]] or [[Process (computing)|process]] has occurred, often in relationship to a [[clock signal]].  The most common type is a [[sequential logic|sequential]] [[digital logic]] circuit with an input line called the  ''clock''  and multiple output lines.  The values on the output lines represent a number in the [[binary number|binary]] or [[binary coded decimal|BCD]] number system. Each pulse applied to the clock input [[:wikt:increment|increment]]s or [[:wikt:decrement|decrement]]s the number in the counter.\n\nA counter circuit is usually constructed of a number of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] connected in cascade. Counters are a very widely used component in [[digital circuit]]s, and are manufactured as separate [[integrated circuit]]s and  also incorporated as parts of larger integrated circuits.\n\n== Electronic counters ==\nIn [[electronics]], counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], and a wide variety of classified  into:\n* Asynchronous (ripple) counter \u2013 changing state bits are used as clocks to subsequent state flip-flops\n* Synchronous counter \u2013 all state bits change under control of a single clock\n* Decade counter \u2013 counts through ten states per stage\n* Up/down counter \u2013 counts both up and down, under command of a control input\n* Ring counter \u2013 formed by a [[shift register]] with feedback connection in a ring\n* Johnson counter \u2013 a ''twisted'' ring counter\n* Cascaded counter\n* Modulus counter.\n\nEach is useful for different applications. Usually, counter circuits are [[Digital data|digital]] in nature, and count in [[binary numeral system|natural binary]]. Many types of counter circuits are available as digital building blocks, for example a number of chips in the [[4000 series|4500 series]] implement different counters.\n\nOccasionally there are advantages to using a counting sequence other than the natural binary sequence\u2014such as the [[binary coded decimal]] counter, a [[linear-feedback shift register#Uses as counters|linear-feedback shift register]] counter, or a [[Gray Code#Gray code counters and arithmetic|Gray-code]] counter.\n\nCounters are useful for digital clocks and timers, and in oven timers, VCR clocks, etc.<ref>{{Citation | title = Digital | publisher = Play hookey | contribution = Synchronous counter | url = http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/synchronous_counter.html}}.</ref>\n\n=== Asynchronous (ripple) counter ===\n[[File:Asynchronous-counter2.svg|thumb|200px|right|Asynchronous counter created from two [[JK flip-flop]]s]]\n\nAn asynchronous (ripple) counter is a single [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|d-type flip-flop]], with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% [[duty cycle]] at exactly half the frequency of the input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip-flop (remembering to invert the output to the input), one will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two-bit counter:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Cycle !! Q1 !! Q0 !! (Q1:Q0)dec\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0  || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 1  || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 1 || 0  || 2\n|-\n| 3 || 1 || 1  || 3\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 0  || 0\n|}\n\nYou can continue to add additional flip-flops, always inverting the output to its own input, and using the output from the previous flip-flop as the clock signal. The result is called a ripple counter, which can count to {{nowrap|2<sup>''n''</sup> - 1}} where ''n'' is the number of bits (flip-flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows \"ripple\" from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division [[ratio]] overall is (to clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit; the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).\n\nThe use of flip-flop outputs as clocks leads to timing skew between the count data bits, making this ripple technique incompatible with normal [[synchronous circuit]] design styles.\n\n=== Synchronous counter ===\n[[File:4-bit-jk-flip-flop V1.1.svg|thumb|400px|right|A 4-bit synchronous counter using JK flip-flops]]\n\nIn synchronous counters, the clock inputs of all the flip-flops are connected together and are triggered by the input pulses.  Thus, all the flip-flops change state simultaneously (in parallel).  The circuit below is a 4-bit synchronous counter.  The J and K inputs of FF0 are connected to HIGH.  FF1 has its J and K inputs connected to the output of FF0, and the J and K inputs of FF2 are connected to the output of an AND gate that is fed by the outputs of FF0 and FF1.\nA simple way of implementing the logic for each bit of an ascending counter (which is what is depicted in the adjacent image) is for each bit to toggle when all of the less significant bits are at a logic high state.  For example, bit 1 toggles when bit 0 is logic high; bit 2 toggles when both bit 1 and bit 0 are logic high; bit 3 toggles when bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are all high; and so on.\n\nSynchronous counters can also be implemented with hardware [[finite-state machine]]s, which are more complex but allow for smoother, more stable transitions.\n\n=== Decade counter ===\n[[File:DecadeCounter.jpg|thumb|A circuit decade counter using JK Flip-flops (74LS112D)]]\nA decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary.  A decade counter may have each (that is, it may count in [[binary-coded decimal]], as the [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|7490]] integrated circuit did) or other binary encodings. \"A decade counter is a binary counter that is designed to count to 1010 (decimal 10). An ordinary four-stage counter can be easily modified to a decade counter by adding a NAND gate as in the schematic to the right. Notice that FF2 and FF4 provide the inputs to the NAND gate. The NAND gate outputs are connected to the CLR input of each of the FFs.\" \nA decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary. It counts from 0 to 9 and then resets to zero. The counter output can be set to zero by pulsing the reset line low. The count then increments on each clock pulse until it reaches 1001 (decimal 9). When it increments to 1010 (decimal 10) both inputs of the NAND gate go high. The result is that the NAND output goes low, and resets the counter to zero. D going low can be a CARRY OUT signal, indicating that there has been a count of ten.\n\n=== Ring counter ===\n{{main article|Ring counter}}\nA ring counter is a circular shift register which is initiated such that only one of its flip-flops is the state one while others are in their zero states.\n\nA ring counter is a [[shift register]] (a cascade connection of [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]) with the output of the last one connected to the input of the first, that is, in a ring.  Typically, a pattern consisting of a single bit is circulated so the state repeats every n clock cycles if n flip-flops are used.\n\n=== Johnson counter ===\n{{main article|Johnson counter}}\nA [[Johnson counter]] (or [[switch-tail ring counter]], [[twisted ring counter]], [[walking ring counter]], or [[M\u00f6bius counter]]) is a modified ring counter, where the output from the last stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage.<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Principles Foundation of Circuit Design and Application | first = Arun Kumar | last = Singh | publisher =  New Age Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 81-224-1759-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=13Wi37h2A-oC&pg=PA113&dq=switchtail+ring+counter+johnson}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | first1 = Paul | last1 = Horowitz | first2 = Winfield | last2 = Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-521-37095-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA667&dq=ring+counter+walking}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Modern Dictionary of Electronics | first = Rudolf F | last = Graf | publisher = Newnes | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7506-9866-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uah1PkxWeKYC&pg=PA401&dq=moebius+ring+counter+johnson}}</ref>  The register cycles through a sequence of bit-patterns, whose length is equal to twice the length of the shift register, continuing indefinitely.

A counter stores a single [[natural number]] (initially [[0 (number)|zero]]) and can be arbitrarily long. A counter is usually considered in conjunction with a [[finite-state machine]] (FSM), which can perform the following operations on the counter:\n\n* Check whether the counter is zero\n* Increment the counter by one.\n* Decrement the counter by one (if it's already zero, this leaves it unchanged).\n\nThe following machines are listed in order of power, with each one being strictly more powerful than the one below it:\n# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM plus two counters\n# Non-deterministic FSM plus one [[stack (data structure)|stack]]\n# Non-deterministic FSM plus one counter\n# Deterministic FSM plus one counter\n# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM.\n\nFor the first and last, it doesn't matter whether the FSM is a [[deterministic finite automaton]] or a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]].  They have the same power.  The first two and the last one are levels of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].\n\nThe first machine, an FSM plus two counters, is equivalent in power to a [[Turing machine]]. See the article on [[counter machine]]s for a proof.\n\n=== Web counter ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WebCounter.png|right|a webmaster's counter options|thumb]] -->\n{{Main article|Web counter}}\n\nA '''web counter''' or '''hit counter''' is a computer software program that indicates the number of visitors, or hits, a particular [[webpage]] has received. Once set up, these counters will be incremented by one every time the web page is accessed in a [[web browser]].\n\nThe number is usually displayed as an inline [[digital image]] or in [[plain text]] or on a physical counter such as a [[#Mechanical counters|mechanical counter]]. Images may be presented in a variety of [[font]]s, or styles; the classic example is the wheels of an [[odometer]].\n\n''Web counter'' was popular in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s, later replaced by more detailed and complete [[web traffic]] measures.\n\n=== Computer based counters ===\n\nMany automation systems use PC and laptops to monitor different parameters of machines and production data. Counters may count parameters such as the number of pieces produced, the production batch number, and measurements of the amounts of material used.\n\n==Mechanical counters ==\n{{main article|Mechanical counter}}\n[[File:Teller (3).jpg|thumb|Mechanical counter wheels showing both sides. The bump on the wheel shown at the top engages the ratchet on the wheel below every turn.]]\n[[File:CountersMechanical.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Several mechanical counters]]\n[[File:Early SSA accounting operations.jpg|thumb|Early IBM tabulating machine using mechanical counters]]\nLong before electronics became common, mechanical devices were used to count events. These are known as [[tally counter]]s. They typically consist of a series of disks mounted on an axle, with the digits zero through nine marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were used as [[odometer]]s for bicycles and cars and in [[tape recorder]]s, [[fuel dispenser]]s, in production machinery as well as in other machinery. One of the largest manufacturers was the [[Veeder-Root]] company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.veeder.com/page/vr_history | title = VR

CMI's scientific activities are managed from the President's office in [[Oxford]], United Kingdom. The institute is \"dedicated to increasing and disseminating [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge.\" It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman [[Landon T. Clay]]. [[Harvard University|Harvard]] mathematician [[Arthur Jaffe]] was the first president of CMI. \n\nWhile the institute is best known for its [[Millennium Prize Problems]], it carries out a wide range of activities, including a [[postdoctoral]] program (ten Clay Research Fellows are supported currently), conferences, workshops, and summer schools.\n\n==Governance==\nThe institute is run according to a standard structure comprising a scientific advisory committee that decides on grant-awarding and research proposals, and a board of directors that oversees and approves the committee's decisions. {{As of|January 2015}}, the board is made up of members of the Clay family, whereas the advisory committee is composed of leading authorities in mathematics, namely [[Andrew Wiles|Sir Andrew Wiles]], [[Michael J. Hopkins|Michael Hopkins]], Carlos Kenig, [[Andrei Okounkov]], and [[Simon Donaldson]].  [[Nicholas Woodhouse]] is the current president of CMI.\n\n==Millennium Prize Problems==<!-- This section is linked from [[Convolution]] -->\n{{Main|Millennium Prize Problems}}\nThe institute is best known for establishing the Millennium Prize Problems on May 24, 2000. These seven problems are considered by CMI to be \"important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years.\" For each problem, the first person to solve it will be awarded $1,000,000 by the CMI. In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to [[Hilbert's problems]], which were proposed in 1900, and had a substantial impact on 20th century mathematics. Of the initial 23 Hilbert problems, most of which have been solved, only the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (formulated in 1859) is included in the seven Millennium Prize Problems.<ref>Arthur Jaffe's first-hand account of how this Millennium Prize came about can be read in [http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-jaffe.pdf The Millennium Grand Challenge in Mathematics].</ref>\n\nFor each problem, the Institute had a professional mathematician write up an official statement of the problem, which will be the main standard by which a given solution will be measured against. The seven problems are:\n\n* [[P versus NP]]\n* The [[Hodge conjecture]]\n* The [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]\u2014solved, by [[Grigori Perelman]]<ref name=\"press-release-2010-03-18\">{{cite press release|publisher=Clay Mathematics Institute| date=March 18, 2010 | format=PDF | title = Prize for Resolution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture Awarded to Dr. Grigoriy Perelman|url = http://www.claymath.org/poincare/millenniumPrizeFull.pdf | accessdate=March 18, 2010 | quote = The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) announces today that Dr. Grigoriy Perelman of [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, is the recipient of the Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.}}</ref>\n* The [[Riemann hypothesis]]\n* [[Yang\u2013Mills existence and mass gap]]\n* [[Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness]]\n* The [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]]\n\nSome of the mathematicians who were involved in the selection and presentation of the seven problems were [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Pierre Deligne]], [[Charles Fefferman]], [[John Milnor]], [[David Mumford]], [[Andrew Wiles]], and [[Edward Witten]].\n\n==Other awards==\n===The Clay Research Award===\n{{main|Clay Research Award}}\nIn recognition of major breakthroughs in mathematical research, the institute has an annual prize \u2014 the Clay Research Award. Its recipients to date are [[Ian Agol]], [[Manindra Agrawal]], [[Yves Benoist]], [[Manjul Bhargava]], [[Danny Calegari]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Nils Dencker]], [[Alex Eskin]], [[David Gabai]], [[Ben J.

The institute also has a yearly [[Clay Research Award]], recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research. Finally, the institute organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians (from the high school to postdoctoral level). CMI publications are available in PDF form at most six months after they appear in print.\n\nThe episode of the television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' entitled \"Solve for X\" ([[List of Elementary episodes#Season 2 (2013\u201314)|Season 2, Episode 2]]) mentions the Clay Mathematics Institute in reference to their involvement in the [[P versus NP problem]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{aut|[[Keith Devlin|Keith J.

Here the family tree has been rendered as an [[Euler diagram]] without overlapping subareas. The [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]] allows overlapping regions.]]\n\nIn [[linguistics]], the '''comparative method''' is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|common descent]] from a shared ancestor, in order to extrapolate back to infer the properties of that ancestor. The comparative method may be contrasted with the method of [[internal reconstruction]], in which the internal development of a single language is inferred by the analysis of features within that language.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.</ref> Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesised relationships between languages.\n\nThe comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.</ref> Here is Schleicher's explanation of why he offered reconstructed forms:<ref>{{harvnb|Schleicher|1874|p=8}}.</ref>\n<blockquote>In the present work an attempt is made to set forth the inferred [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European original language]] side by side with its really existent derived languages. Besides the advantages offered by such a plan, in setting immediately before the eyes of the student the final results of the investigation in a more concrete form, and thereby rendering easier his insight into the nature of particular [[Indo-European languages]], there is, I think, another of no less importance gained by it, namely that it shows the baselessness of the assumption that the non-Indian Indo-European languages were derived from Old-Indian ([[Sanskrit]]).</blockquote>\n\n== Demonstrating genetic relationship ==\nThe comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s descend from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of a proto-language. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established\u2014with chance similarities ruled out.\n\n===Terminology===\n''Descent'' is defined as transmission across the generations: children learn a language from the parents' generation and after being influenced by their peers transmit it to the next generation, and so on. For example, a continuous chain of speakers across the centuries links [[Vulgar Latin]] to all of its modern descendants.\n\nTwo languages are ''[[genetic (linguistics)|genetically]] related'' if they descended from the same [[Proto-language|ancestor language]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp= 1\u20132}}.</ref> For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] both come from [[Latin]] and therefore belong to the same family, the [[Romance languages]].<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 25}}.</ref> Having a large component of vocabulary from a certain origin is not sufficient to establish relatedness: for example, as a result of heavy [[loanword|borrowing]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], Modern Persian in fact takes more of its [[vocabulary]] from Arabic than from its direct ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], but Persian remains a member of the Indo-Iranian family and is not considered \"related\" to Arabic.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2000|p= 1341}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is possible for languages to have different degrees of relatedness. [[English language|English]], for example, is related both to [[German language|German]] and to [[Russian language|Russian]], but is more closely related to the former than to the latter. Although all three languages share a common ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], English and German also share a more recent common ancestor, [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], while Russian does not. Therefore, English and German are considered to belong to a different subgroup, the [[Germanic languages]].<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 22, 27\u201329}}.</ref>\n\n''Shared retentions'' from the parent language are not sufficient evidence of a sub-group. For example, German and Russian both retain from Proto-Indo-European a contrast between the [[dative case]] and the [[accusative case]], which English has lost. However, this similarity between German and Russian is not evidence that German is more closely related to Russian than to English; it only means that the ''innovation'' in question\u2014the loss of the accusative/dative distinction\u2014happened more recently in English than the divergence of English from German. The division of related languages into sub-groups is more certainly accomplished by finding ''shared linguistic innovations'' differentiating them from the parent language, rather than shared features retained from the parent language.\n\n===Origin and development of the method===\n[[File:Sajnovics - Demonstratio.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Sajnovic's 1770 work.]]\nLanguages have been compared since antiquity. For example, in the 1st century BC the Romans were aware of the similarities between Greek and Latin, which they explained mythologically, as the result of Rome being a Greek colony speaking a debased dialect. In the 9th or 10th century AD, [[Yehuda Ibn Quraysh]] compared the phonology and morphology of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, but attributed this resemblance to the Biblical story of Babel, with Abraham, Isaac and Joseph retaining Adam's language, with other languages at various removes becoming more altered from the original Hebrew.<ref>\"The reason for this similarity and the cause of this intermixture was their close neighboring in the land and their genealogical closeness, since Terah the father of Abraham was Syrian, and Laban was Syrian. Ishmael and Kedar were Arabized from the Time of Division, the time of the confounding [of tongues] at Babel, and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob (peace be upon them) retained the Holy Tongue from the original Adam.\" [http://lameen.googlepages.com/ibn-quraysh.html Introduction of Risalat Yehuda Ibn Quraysh \u2013 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0630\u0627 \u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634]</ref>\n\nIn publications of 1647 and 1654, [[Marcus van Boxhorn]] first described a rigid methodology for historical linguistic comparisons<ref name=Driem>George van Driem [http://www.eastling.org/paper/Driem.pdf The genesis of polyphyletic linguistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012439/http://www.eastling.org/paper/Driem.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}</ref> and proposed the existence of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] proto-language (which he called \"Scythian\") unrelated to Hebrew, but ancestral to Germanic, Greek, Romance, Persian, Sanskrit, Slavic, Celtic and Baltic languages. The Scythian theory was further developed by [[Andreas J\u00e4ger]] (1686) and [[William Wotton]] (1713), who made early forays to reconstruct this primitive common language.<!-- ?? Perhaps he just proposed to do so. --> In 1710 and 1723 [[Lambert ten Kate]] first formulated the regularity of [[sound law]]s, introducing among others, the term [[root vowel]].<ref name=Driem/>\n\nAnother early systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of [[grammar]] and [[lexicon]] was made by the Hungarian [[J\u00e1nos Sajnovics]] in 1770, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (work that was later extended to the whole [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language family]] in 1799 by his countryman [[Samuel Gyarmathi]]),<ref name=\"ssix\">{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p= 6}}.</ref> But the origin of modern [[historical linguistics]] is often traced back to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], an English [[Philology|philologist]] living in [[India]], who in 1786 made his famous {{nowrap|observation:<ref>{{cite web|last= Jones|first= Sir William|title= The Third Anniversary Discourse delivered 2 February 1786 By the President [on the Hindus]|editor-first= Guido|editor-last= Abbattista|publisher= Eliohs Electronic Library of Historiography|url= http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/700/jones/Jones_Discourse_3.html|accessdate= 18 December 2009}}</ref>}}\n<blockquote>The [[Sanskrit|Sanscrit language]], whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], more copious than the [[Latin language|Latin]], and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.

The first professional comparison between the [[Indo-European languages]] known then was made by the German linguist [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816.

Although [[Hermann Grassmann]] explained one of these anomalies with the publication of [[Grassmann's law]] in 1862,<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p=19}}.</ref> [[Karl Verner]] made a methodological breakthrough in 1875 when he identified a pattern now known as [[Verner's law]], the first sound-law based on comparative evidence showing that a [[phonology|phonological]] change in one [[phoneme]] could depend on other factors within the same word (such as the neighbouring phonemes and the position of the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]]<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p=20}}.</ref>), now called ''conditioning environments''.\n\nSimilar discoveries made by the ''Junggrammatiker'' (usually translated as \"[[Neogrammarians]]\") at the [[University of Leipzig]] in the late 19th century led them to conclude that all sound changes were ultimately regular, resulting in the famous statement by [[Karl Brugmann]] and [[Hermann Osthoff]] in 1878 that \"sound laws have no exceptions\".<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p= 21}}.</ref> This idea is fundamental to the modern comparative method, since the method necessarily assumes regular correspondences between sounds in related languages, and consequently regular sound changes from the proto-language. This ''Neogrammarian Hypothesis'' led to application of the comparative method to reconstruct [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] being at that time by far the most well-studied language family. Linguists working with other families soon followed suit, and the comparative method quickly became the established method for uncovering linguistic relationships.<ref name=\"ssix\"/>\n\n===Application===\n{{IPA notice}}\nThere is no fixed set of steps to be followed in the application of the comparative method, but some steps are suggested by [[Lyle Campbell]]<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp= 126\u2013147}}</ref> and [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]],<ref>{{harvnb|Crowley|1992|pp= 108\u2013109}}</ref> both authors of introductory texts in historical linguistics.

An extreme case is represented by [[Pirah\u00e3 language|Pirah\u00e3]], a [[Muran languages|Muran language]] of South America, which, it is controversially<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |first2=David |last2=Pesetsky |first3=Cilene |last3=Rodrigues |year=2009 |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/%7Enevins/npr09.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103305/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~nevins/npr09.pdf |archive-date=4 June 2011 |title=Pirah\u00e3 Exceptionality: a Reassessment |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=355\u2013404 |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0107}}</ref> claimed, borrowed all its [[pronoun]]s from [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomason|2005|pp=8\u201312 in pdf}}; {{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p= 355}}.</ref><ref>\"Superficially, however, the Piraha pronouns don't look much like the Tupi\u2013Guarani pronouns; so this proposal will not be convincing without some additional information about the phonology of Piraha that shows how the phonetic realizations of the Tupi\u2013Guarani forms align with the Piraha phonemic system.\" [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/pronborr.pdf \"Pronoun borrowing\" Sarah G.

Everett University of Michigan & University of Manchester]</ref>\n\n====Step 2, establish correspondence sets====\nThe next step involves determining the regular sound-correspondences exhibited by the lists of potential cognates. For example, in the Polynesian data above, it is apparent that words that contain ''t'' in most of the languages listed have cognates in Hawaiian with ''k'' in the same position. This is visible in multiple cognate sets: the words glossed as 'one', 'three', 'man', and 'taboo' all show this relationship. This situation is termed a ''regular correspondence'' between ''k'' in Hawaiian and ''t'' in the other Polynesian languages. Similarly, in those data a regular correspondence can be seen between Hawaiian and Rapanui ''h'', Tongan and Samoan ''f'', Maori ''\u0278'', and Rarotongan ''\u0294''.\n\nMere phonetic similarity, as between [[English language|English]] ''day'' and [[Latin]] ''dies'' (both with the same meaning), has no probative value.<ref name=\"ltwo\">{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p= 2}}.</ref> English initial ''d-'' does not ''regularly'' match {{nowrap|Latin ''d-''<ref name=\"bonetwoseven\">{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 127}}</ref>}}\u2014it is not possible to assemble a large set of English and Latin non-borrowed cognates such that English ''d'' repeatedly and consistently corresponds to Latin ''d'' at the beginning of a word\u2014and whatever sporadic matches can be observed are due either to chance (as in the above example) or to [[loanword|borrowing]] (for example, Latin ''diabolus'' and English ''devil''\u2014both ultimately of Greek origin<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title= devil|encyclopedia= Dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/devil}}</ref>). English and Latin ''do'' exhibit a regular correspondence of ''t-'' : ''d-''<ref name=\"bonetwoseven\"/> (where the notation \"A : B\" means \"A corresponds to B\"); for example,<ref>In Latin, |c| represents {{IPA|/k/}}; ''dingua'' is an [[Old Latin]] form of the word later attested as ''lingua'' (\"tongue\").</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| align=left | &nbsp;'''English'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''t'''en&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''t'''wo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''t'''ow&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''t'''ongue&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''t'''ooth&nbsp;\n|-\n| align=left | &nbsp;'''Latin'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''d'''ecem&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''d'''uo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''d'''\u016bco&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''d'''ingua&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;'''d'''ent-&nbsp;\n|}\n\nIf there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), then a common origin becomes a virtual certainty, particularly if some of the correspondences are non-trivial or unusual.<ref name=\"ltwothree\"/>\n\n====Step 3, discover which sets are in complementary distribution====\nDuring the late 18th to late 19th century, two major developments improved the method's effectiveness.\n\nFirst, it was found{{by whom?|date=November 2017}} that many sound changes are conditioned by a specific ''context''. For example, in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|stop]] evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later in the same word;<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 128}}.</ref> this is [[Grassmann's law]], first described for [[Sanskrit]] by [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit grammarian]] [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]<ref>{{harvnb|Sag|1974|p=591}}; {{harvnb|Janda|1989}}.</ref> and promulgated by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1863.\n\nSecond, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred in contexts that were later lost. For instance, in Sanskrit [[Velar consonant|velars]] (''k''-like sounds) were replaced by [[Palatal consonant|palatals]] (''ch''-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was ''*i'' or ''*e''.<ref>The asterisk (*) indicates that the sound is inferred/reconstructed, rather than historically documented or attested</ref> Subsequent to this change, all instances of ''*e'' were replaced by ''a''.<ref>Or, more accurately, earlier ''*e'', ''*o'', and ''*a'' merged as ''a''.</ref> The situation would have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of ''e'' and ''a'' been recoverable from the evidence of other [[Indo-European languages]].<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 60\u201361}}.</ref> For instance, the [[Latin]] suffix ''que'', \"and\", preserves the original ''*e'' vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| &nbsp;'''1.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;''*ke''&nbsp;\n| &nbsp;Pre-Sanskrit \"and\"&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''2.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;''*ce''&nbsp;\n| &nbsp;Velars replaced by palatals before ''*i'' and ''*e''&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''3.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;''ca''&nbsp;\n| &nbsp;The attested Sanskrit form.

Following the change, the accent shifted to initial position.<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 130\u2013131}}.</ref> Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with Greek and Sanskrit accent patterns.\n\nThis stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets apply in [[complementary distribution]], they can be assumed to reflect a single original [[phoneme]]: \"some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set\".<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 136}}.</ref>\n\nFor example, the following potential cognate list can be established for [[Romance languages]], which descend from [[Latin]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! &nbsp;[[Italian language|Italian]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Spanish language|Spanish]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[French language|French]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Gloss&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''1.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;corpo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cuerpo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;corpo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;corps&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;body&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''2.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;crudo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;crudo&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cru&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cru&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;raw&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''3.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;catena&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cadena&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cadeia&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cha\u00eene&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;chain&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''4.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cacciare&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;cazar&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;ca\u00e7ar&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;chasser&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;to hunt&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThey evidence two correspondence sets, ''k : k'' and ''k : {{IPA link|\u0283}}:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! &nbsp;[[Italian language|Italian]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Spanish language|Spanish]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[French language|French]]&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''1.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''2.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;k&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;{{IPA|\u0283}}&nbsp;\n|}\n\nSince French ''{{IPA|\u0283}}'' only occurs before ''a'' where the other languages also have ''a'', while French ''k'' occurs elsewhere, the difference is due to different environments (being before an ''a'' conditions the change) and the sets are complementary. They can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case ''*k'', spelled |c| in [[Latin language|Latin]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 26}}.</ref> The original Latin words are ''corpus'', ''crudus'', ''catena'' and ''captiare'', all with an initial k-sound. If more evidence along these lines were given, one might conclude an alteration of the original k took place because of a different environment.\n\nA more complex case involves consonant clusters in [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]]. The Algonquianist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] used the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages to reconstruct the following correspondence sets:<ref>The table is modified from that in {{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 141}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! &nbsp;[[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Fox language|Meskwaki]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Menominee language|Menomini]]&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''1.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;kk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''2.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;kk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''3.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;{{IPA|t\u0361\u0283k}}&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''4.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;{{IPA|\u0283k}}&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;{{IPA|\u0283k}}&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''5.'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;sk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;{{IPA|\u0283k}}&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;hk&nbsp;\n|}\n\nAlthough all five correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set; his reconstructions were, respectively, ''*hk'', ''*xk'', ''*\u010dk'' (={{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283k]}}), ''*\u0161k'' (={{IPA|[\u0283k]}}), and ''\u00e7k'' (where {{'}}''x''{{'}} and {{'}}''\u00e7''{{'}} are arbitrary symbols, not attempts to guess the phonetic value of the proto-phonemes).<ref>{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1925}}.</ref>\n\n====Step 4, reconstruct proto-phonemes====\nTypology assists in deciding what reconstruction best fits the data. For example, the voicing of voiceless stops between vowels is common, but not the devoicing of voiced stops in that environment. If a correspondence ''-t-'' : ''-d-'' between vowels is found in two languages, the proto-[[phoneme]] is more likely to be ''*-t-'', with a development to the voiced form in the second language. The opposite reconstruction would represent a rare type.\n\nHowever, unusual sound changes do occur. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for ''two'', for example, is reconstructed as ''*dw\u014d'', which is reflected in [[Classical Armenian]] as ''erku''. Several other cognates demonstrate a regular change ''*dw-'' \u2192 ''erk-'' in Armenian.<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p= 28}}; citing {{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi| 1960|p= 96}}.</ref> Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] of [[Slavey language|Slavey]], there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan ''*ts'' \u2192 Bearlake ''{{IPA|k\u02b7}}''.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1997|p=113}}.</ref> It is very unlikely that ''*dw-'' changed directly into ''erk-'' and ''*ts'' into ''{{IPA|k\u02b7}}'', but instead they probably went through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. It is not phonetic similarity which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but regular sound correspondences.<ref name=\"ltwo\"/>\n\nBy the [[principle of economy]], the reconstruction of a proto-phoneme should require as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. For example, [[Algonquian languages]] exhibit the following correspondence set:<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.native-languages.org/famalg_words.htm|title= Vocabulary Words in the Algonquian Language Family|date= 1998\u20132009|publisher= Native Languages of the Americas|first= Laura|last= Redish|first2= Orrin|last2= Lewis|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goddard|1974}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! &nbsp;[[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Mi'kmaq language|M\u00edkmaq]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Cree language|Cree]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Munsee language|Munsee]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]&nbsp;\n|-\n| align=center | &nbsp;m&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;m&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;m&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;m&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;m&nbsp;\n| align=center | &nbsp;b&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe simplest reconstruction for this set would be either ''*m'' or ''*b''. Both ''*m'' \u2192 ''b'' and ''*b'' \u2192 ''m'' are likely. Because ''m'' occurs in five of the languages, and ''b'' in only one, if ''*b'' is reconstructed, then it is necessary to assume five separate changes of ''*b'' \u2192 ''m'', whereas if ''*m'' is reconstructed, it is only necessary to assume a single change of ''*m'' \u2192 ''b''. ''*m'' would be most economical. (This argument assumes that the languages other than Arapaho are at least partly independent of each other. If they all formed a common subgroup, the development ''*b'' \u2192 ''m'' would only have to be assumed to have occurred once.)\n\n====Step 5, examine the reconstructed system typologically====\nIn the final step, the linguist checks to see how the proto-[[phoneme]]s fit the known [[linguistic typology|typological constraints]]. For example, a hypothetical system,\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! &nbsp; p &nbsp;\n! &nbsp; t &nbsp;\n! &nbsp; k &nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp; b &nbsp;\n!\n!\n|-\n!\n! &nbsp; n &nbsp;\n! &nbsp; \u014b &nbsp;\n|-\n!\n! &nbsp; l &nbsp;\n!\n|}\n\nhas only one [[Voiced bilabial stop|voiced stop]], ''*b'', and although it has an [[alveolar nasal|alveolar]] and a [[velar nasal]], ''*n'' and ''*\u014b'', there is no corresponding [[Bilabial nasal|labial nasal]]. However, languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories. In this case, the linguist might attempt to investigate the possibilities that what was earlier reconstructed as ''*b'' is in fact ''*m'', or that the ''*n'' and ''*\u014b'' are in fact ''*d'' and ''*g''.\n\nEven a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the traditional [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stop inventory is:<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=124}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!&nbsp;[[Labial consonant|Labials]]&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;[[Dental consonant|Dentals]]&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;[[Velar consonant|Velars]]&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;[[labialized velar consonant|Labiovelars]]&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;[[Palatovelar]]s&nbsp;\n|-\n!&nbsp;[[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]]&nbsp;\n| align=center|p\n| align=center|t\n| align=center|k\n| align=center|{{IPA|k\u02b7}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|k\u02b2}}\n|-\n!&nbsp;[[Voiced consonant|Voiced]]&nbsp;\n| align=center|(b)\n| align=center|d\n| align=center|g\n| align=center|{{IPA|\u0261\u02b7}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|\u0261\u02b2}}\n|-\n!&nbsp;[[Voiced consonant|Voiced]] [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]&nbsp;\n| align=center|{{IPA|b\u02b1}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|d\u02b1}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|\u0261\u02b1}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|\u0261\u02b7\u02b1}}\n| align=center|{{IPA|\u0261\u02b2\u02b1}}\n|}\n\nAn earlier voiceless aspirated row was removed on grounds of insufficient evidence. Since the mid-20th century, a number of linguists have argued that this phonology is implausible;<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p= 143}}.</ref> that it is extremely unlikely for a language to have a voiced aspirated ([[breathy voice]]) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. [[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] provided a potential solution, arguing that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as [[Glottalization|glottalized]]\u2014either [[implosive consonant|implosive]] {{IPA|(\u0253, \u0257, \u0260)}} or [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] {{IPA|(p\u02bc, t\u02bc, k\u02bc)}}. The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be replaced by just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both.<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 109\u2013113}}.</ref> This example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction has become known as the [[Glottalic theory|Glottalic Theory]]. It has a large number of proponents but is not generally accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi| 1996|pp= 151\u2013152}}.</ref> As an alternative, the voiceless aspirated row was restored.{{by whom|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe reconstruction of proto-sounds logically precedes the reconstruction of grammatical [[morpheme]]s (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage is an open-ended task.\n\n==Limitations==\n\n===Problems with the history of historical linguistics===\nThe limitations of the comparative method were recognized by the very linguists who developed it,<ref>{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=4\u20135, 7\u20138}}.</ref> but it is still seen as a valuable tool. In the case of Indo-European, the method seemed to at least partially validate the centuries-old search for an [[Ursprache]], the original language. These others were presumed ordered in a [[family tree]], becoming the [[tree model]] of the [[neogrammarians]].\n\nThe archaeologists followed suit, attempting to find archaeological evidence of a culture or cultures that could be presumed to have spoken a [[proto-language]], such as [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s ''The Aryans: a study of Indo-European origins'', 1926. Childe was a philologist turned archaeologist. These views culminated in the ''Siedlungsarchaologie'', or \"settlement-archaeology\", of [[Gustaf Kossinna]], becoming known as \"Kossinna's Law\". He asserted that cultures represent ethnic groups, including their languages. It was rejected as a law in the post\u2013World War II era. The fall of Kossinna's Law removed the temporal and spatial framework previously applied to many proto-languages. Fox concludes:<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1995|pp=141\u20132}}.</ref>\n<blockquote>The Comparative Method ''as such'' is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...[Our increased knowledge about the historical processes involved] has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.</blockquote>\n\nProto-languages can be verified in many historical instances, such as Latin. Although no longer a law, settlement-archaeology is known to be essentially valid for some cultures that straddle history and prehistory, such as the Celtic Iron Age (mainly Celtic) and [[Mycenaean civilization]] (mainly Greek). None of these models can be or have been completely rejected, and yet none alone are sufficient.\n\n===Problems with the neogrammarian hypothesis===\nThe foundation of the comparative method, and of comparative linguistics in general, is the [[Neogrammarian]]s' fundamental assumption that \"sound laws have no exceptions\". When it was initially proposed, critics of the Neogrammarians proposed an alternate position, summarized by the maxim \"each word has its own history\".<ref>{{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p=23}}.</ref> Several types of change do in fact alter words in non-regular ways. Unless identified, they may hide or distort laws and cause false perceptions of relationship.\n\n====Borrowing====\nAll languages [[loanword|borrow words]] from other languages in various contexts. They are likely to have followed the laws of the languages from which they were borrowed rather than the laws of the borrowing language.\n\n====Areal diffusion====\nBorrowing on a larger scale occurs in [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal diffusion]], when features are adopted by contiguous languages over a geographical area. The borrowing may be [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morpheme|morphological]] or [[Lexeme|lexical]]. A false proto-language over the area may be reconstructed for them or may be taken to be a third language serving as a source of diffused features.<ref>{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|2001|pp=2\u20133}}.</ref>\n\nSeveral areal features and other influences may converge to form a [[sprachbund]], a wider region sharing features that appear to be related but are diffusional. For instance, the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] suggested several false classifications of such languages as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] before it was recognized.\n\n====Random mutations====\nSporadic changes, such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation, do not follow any laws. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''palabra'' ('word'), ''peligro'' ('danger') and ''milagro'' ('miracle') should have been ''parabla'', ''periglo'', ''miraglo'' by regular sound changes from the Latin ''parab\u014fla'', ''per\u012bc\u016dlum'' and ''m\u012br\u0101c\u016dlum'', but the ''r'' and ''l'' changed places by sporadic [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=39}}.</ref>\n\n====Analogy====\n[[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]] is the sporadic change of a feature to be like another feature in the same or a different language. It may affect a single word or be generalized to an entire class of features, such as a verb paradigm. For example, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for ''nine'', by regular sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], should have been {{IPA|/n\u02b2ev\u02b2at\u02b2/}}, but is in fact {{IPA|/d\u02b2ev\u02b2at\u02b2/}}. It is believed that the initial ''{{IPA|n\u02b2-}}'' changed to ''{{IPA|d\u02b2-}}'' under influence of the word for \"ten\" in Russian, {{IPA|/d\u02b2es\u02b2at\u02b2/}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=79}}.</ref>\n\n====Gradual application====\nStudents of contemporary language changes, such as [[William Labov]], note that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors.<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Szemer\u00e9nyi|1996|p=3}}.</ref> The sound change gradually spreads, a process known as [[lexical diffusion]]. While not invalidating the Neogrammarians' axiom that \"sound laws have no exceptions\", their gradual application shows that they do not always apply to all lexical items at the same time. Hock notes,<ref>{{harvnb|Hock|1991|pp=446\u2013447}}.</ref> \"While it probably is true in the long run every word has its own history, it is not justified to conclude as some linguists have, that therefore the Neogrammarian position on the nature of linguistic change is falsified.\"\n\n===Problems with the tree model===\nThe comparative method is used to construct a tree model (German ''Stammbaum'') of language evolution,<ref>{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=7\u20138}}.</ref> in which daughter languages are seen as branching from the [[proto-language]], gradually growing more distant from it through accumulated [[phonology|phonological]], [[morpho-syntactic]], and [[lexicon|lexical]] changes.\n[[File:Uto-Aztecan Family Tree.jpg|thumb|720px|center|An example of the Tree Model, used to represent the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language family spoken throughout the southern and western United States and Mexico.<ref>The diagram is based on the hierarchical list in {{harvnb|Mithun|1999|pp=539\u2013540}} and on the map in {{harvnb|Campbell| 1997|p=358}}.</ref> Families are in '''bold''', individual languages in ''italics''. Not all branches and languages are shown.]]\n\n====The presumption of a well-defined node====\n[[File:Wave model Schmidt.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Wave model (linguistics)|Wave Model]] has been proposed as an alternative to the [[tree model]] for representing language change.<ref>This diagram is based partly on the one found in Fox 1995:128, and Johannes Schmidt, 1872. ''Die Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen''. Weimar: H. B\u00f6hlau</ref> In this [[Venn diagram]], each circle represents a \"wave\" or [[isogloss]], i.e. the maximum geographical extension of a linguistic change as it propagated through the speaker population. These circles, which represent successive historical events of propagation, typically intersect. Each language in the family differs as to which isoglosses it belongs to, i.e. which innovations it reflects. The tree model presumes that all the circles should be nested, and never crosscut; but studies in [[dialectology]] and historical linguistics have shown this assumption to be usually wrong, suggesting that the wave-based approach may be more realistic than the tree model. A genealogical family in which isoglosses intersect is called a [[dialect continuum]] or a ''[[linkage (linguistics)|linkage]]''.]]\nThe tree model features nodes that are presumed to be distinct proto-languages existing independently in distinct regions during distinct historical times. The reconstruction of unattested proto-languages lends itself to that illusion: they cannot be verified and the linguist is free to select whatever definite times and places for them seem best. Right from the outset of Indo-European studies, however, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] said:<ref>{{citation|title=Miscellaneous works of the late Thomas Young|first=Thomas |last=Young|contribution=Languages, From the Supplement to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, vol. V, 1824|volume=Volume III, Hieroglyphical Essays and Correspondence, &c.|editor-first=John|editor-last=Leitch|location=London|publisher=John Murray|year=1855|page=480}}</ref><blockquote>It is not, however, very easy to say what the definition should be that should constitute a separate language, but it seems most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be understood by common persons in the habit of speaking the other ... Still, however, it may remain doubtfull whether the Danes and the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well ... nor is it possible to say if the twenty ways of pronouncing the sounds, belonging to the Chinese characters, ought or ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects... But, ... the languages so nearly allied must stand next to each other in a systematic order\u2026</blockquote>\n\nThe assumption of uniformity in a proto-language, implicit in the comparative method, is problematic. Even in small language communities there are always [[Dialect|dialect differences]], whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors. The [[Pirah\u00e3 language]] of [[Brazil]] is spoken by only several hundred people, but it has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women.<ref>{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Ladefoged|2003|p=14}}.</ref> Campbell points out:<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=146\u2013147}}</ref>\n<blockquote>It is not so much that the comparative method 'assumes' no variation; rather, it is just that there is nothing built into the comparative method which would allow it to address variation directly....This assumption of uniformity is a reasonable idealization; it does no more damage to the understanding of the language than, say, modern reference grammars do which concentrate on a language's general structure, typically leaving out consideration of regional or social variation.</blockquote>\n\nDifferent dialects, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even after they are considered distinct, languages near to one another continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family may spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change are communicated like waves across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1995|p=129}}</ref> If a language is divided into an inventory of features, each with its own time and range ([[isogloss]]es), they do not all coincide. History and prehistory may not offer a time and place for a distinct coincidence, as may be the case for [[Italic languages|proto-Italic]], in which case the proto-language is only a concept. However, Hock<ref>{{harvnb|Hock|1991|p=454}}.</ref> observes:\n\n<blockquote>The discovery in the late nineteenth century that [[isogloss]]es can cut across well-established linguistic boundaries at first created considerable attention and controversy. And it became fashionable to oppose a wave theory to a tree theory... Today, however, it is quite evident that the phenomena referred to by these two terms are complementary aspects of linguistic change...</blockquote>\n\n====Subjectivity of the reconstruction====\nThe reconstruction of unknown proto-languages is inherently subjective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] example above, the choice of ''*m'' as the parent [[phoneme]] is only ''likely'', not ''certain''. It is conceivable that a Proto-Algonquian language with ''*b'' in those positions split into two branches, one which preserved ''*b'' and one which changed it to ''*m'' instead; and while the first branch only developed into [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], the second spread out wider and developed into all the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes. It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the [[Algonquian languages]] used some other sound instead, such as ''*p'', which eventually mutated to ''*b'' in one branch and to ''*m'' in the other. While examples of strikingly complicated and even circular developments are indeed known to have occurred (such as [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*t'' > Pre-Proto-Germanic ''*\u00fe'' > [[Proto-Germanic language|PG]] ''*\u00f0'' > Proto-West-Germanic ''*d'' > [[Old High German]] ''t'' in ''fater'' > Modern German ''Vater''), in the absence of any evidence or other reason to postulate a more complicated development, the preference of a simpler explanation is justified by the principle of parsimony, also known as [[Occam's razor]]. Since reconstruction involves many of these choices, some linguists prefer to view the reconstructed features as abstract representations of sound correspondences, rather than as objects with a historical time and place.\n\nThe existence of proto-languages and the validity of the comparative method is verifiable in cases where the reconstruction can be matched to a known language, which may only be known as a shadow in the [[loanword]]s of another language. For example, [[Finnic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have borrowed many words from an early stage of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and the shape of the loans matches the forms that have been reconstructed for [[Proto-Germanic]]. Finnish ''kuningas'' 'king' and ''kaunis'' 'beautiful' match the Germanic reconstructions *''kuningaz'' and *''skauniz'' (> German ''K\u00f6nig'' 'king', ''sch\u00f6n'' 'beautiful').<ref>{{harvnb|Kylstra|1996|p=62}} for KAUNIS, p. 122 for KUNINGAS.</ref>\n\n====Additional models====\nThe [[Wave model (linguistics)|Wave model]] was developed in the 1870s as an alternative to the tree model, in order to represent the historical patterns of language diversification. Both the tree-based and the wave-based representations are compatible with the Comparative Method.<ref>[[#linkage|Fran\u00e7ois (2014)]], [[#kf|Kalyan & Fran\u00e7ois (2018)]].</ref>\n\nBy contrast, some approaches are incompatible with the Comparative method, including [[glottochronology]] and [[mass lexical comparison]]. Most historical linguists consider these to be flawed and unreliable.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=201}}; {{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=8}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparative linguistics]]\n* [[Historical linguistics]]\n* [[Lexicostatistics]]\n* [[Proto-language]]\n* [[Swadesh list]]\n==Notes==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation|authorlink=Alexandra Aikhenvald|contribution=Other small families and isolates|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57021-2|title=The Amazonian Languages|editor-first=R.

The council ended the [[Western Schism]] by deposing or accepting the resignation of the remaining papal claimants and by electing [[Pope Martin V]].\n\nThe council also condemned [[Jan Hus]] as a heretic and facilitated his execution by the civil authority. It also ruled on issues of national sovereignty, the rights of pagans and just war, in response to a conflict between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Teutonic Knights|Order of the Teutonic Knights]]. The council is important for its relationship to ecclesial [[conciliarism]] and [[Papal supremacy]].\n\n==Origin and background==\n[[File:Meister der Chronik des Konzils von Konstanz 001.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Sigismund, his second wife, [[Barbara of Cilli|Barbara of Celje]], and their daughter, [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]], at the Council of Constance]]\nThe council's main purpose was to end the Papal schism which had resulted from the confusion following the [[Avignon Papacy]]. [[Pope Gregory XI]]'s return to Rome in 1377, followed by his death (in 1378) and the controversial election of his successor, [[Pope Urban VI]], resulted in the defection of a number of cardinals and the election of a rival pope based at Avignon in 1378. After thirty years of schism, the rival courts convened the [[Council of Pisa]] seeking to resolve the situation by deposing the two claimant popes and electing a new one.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vom Schisma zur 'verfluchten Dreiheit' |trans-title=From the Schism to the 'Accursed Trinity' |first=Ansgar |last=Frenken |journal=Damals |pages=16\u201321}}</ref> The council claimed that in such a situation, a council of bishops had greater authority than just one bishop, even if he were the bishop of Rome. Though the elected [[Antipope Alexander V]] and his successor, [[Antipope John XXIII]] (not to be confused with the 20th-century [[Pope John XXIII]]), gained widespread support, especially at the cost of the Avignon antipope, the schism remained, now involving not two but three claimants: [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] at Rome, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] at Avignon, and John XXIII.\n\nTherefore, many voices, including [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary]] (and later Holy Roman Emperor), pressed for another council to resolve the issue. That council was called by [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and was held from 16 November 1414 to 22 April 1418 in [[Konstanz|Constance]], Germany. According to [[Joseph McCabe]], the council was attended by roughly 29 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s, 100 \"learned doctors of law and divinity\", 134 [[abbot]]s, and 183 [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s and [[archbishop]]s.\n\n==Constance==\nSigismund arrived on Christmas Eve 1414 and exercised a profound and continuous influence on the course of the council in his capacity of imperial protector of the church. An innovation at the council was that instead of voting as individuals, the bishops voted in national blocs. The vote by nations was in great measure the initiative of the English, German, and French members. The legality of this measure, in imitation of the \"nations\" of the universities, was more than questionable, but during February 1415 it carried and thenceforth was accepted in practice, though never authorized by any formal decree of the council. The four \"nations\" consisted of England, France, Italy, and Germany, with Poles, Hungarians, Danes, and Scandinavians counted with the Germans. While the Italian representatives made up half of those in attendance, they were equal in influence to the English who sent twenty deputies and three bishops.<ref name=\"shahan\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04288a.htm Shahan, Thomas. \"Council of Constance.\" ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''] Vol. 4.

Partly in response to a fierce anonymous attack on his character from an Italian source, on 2 March 1415 he promised to resign. However, on 20 March he secretly fled the city and took refuge at Schaffhausen in territory of his friend Frederick, Duke of Austria-Tyrol.<ref name=shahan/>\n\nThe famous decree ''Haec Sancta Synodus,'' which gave primacy to the authority of the council and thus became a source for ecclesial [[conciliarism]], was promulgated in the fifth session, 6 April 1415:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=|Legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit, constituting a general council and representing the Catholic church militant, it has power immediately from Christ; and everyone of whatever state or dignity, even papal, is bound to obey it in those matters which pertain to the faith, the eradication of the said schism, and the general reform of the said church of God in head and members.}}\n\n''Haec Sancta Synodus'' marks the high-water mark of the Conciliar movement of reform.<ref>For good, brief discussions of the politics of conciliarism at and after Constance, see Black, Anthony. 1998, \"Popes and Councils\" in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History,''  Volume VII c. 11415\u2013c. 1500, edited by Christopher Allmand, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 67-76; and Watts, John. 2009, ''The Making of Polities,''  ''Europe 1300-1500,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 291-301.</ref><ref name=\"Piar\">{{citation | url = http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum16.htm | title = Councils | place = Hungary | publisher = Piar | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101090223/http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum16.htm | archivedate = 2008-01-01 | df =  }}.</ref> This decree, however, is not considered valid by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, since it was never approved by Pope Gregory XII or his successors, and was passed by the council in a session before his confirmation. The church declared the first sessions of the Council of Constance an invalid and illicit assembly of bishops, gathered under the authority of John XXIII.\n\nThe acts of the council were not made public until 1442, at the behest of the [[Council of Basel]]; they were printed in 1500. The creation of a book on how to die was ordered by the council, and thus written in 1415 under the title ''[[Ars moriendi]]''.\n\n==Ending the Western Schism==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Imperia statue.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Imperia (statue)|Imperia]]'', a 1993-erected statue commemorating the council]]\n\nWith the support of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]], enthroned before the high altar of the cathedral of Constance, the Council of Constance recommended that all three papal claimants abdicate, and that another be chosen. In part because of the constant presence of the King, other rulers demanded that they have a say in who would be pope.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Sigismunds Meisterst\u00fcck |trans-title=Sigismund's Masterpiece |first=Karin |last=Stober |magazine=Damals |issue=2 |year=2014 |pages=24\u201331}}</ref>\n\nGregory XII then sent representatives to Constance, whom he granted full powers to summon, open, and preside over an Ecumenical Council; he also empowered them to present his resignation to the Papacy. This would pave the way for the end of the Western Schism.\n\nThe legates were received by King Sigismund and by the assembled Bishops, and the King yielded the presidency of the proceedings to the papal legates, Cardinal [[John Dominici|Giovanni Dominici of Ragusa]] and Prince [[Carlo I Malatesta|Carlo Malatesta]]. On 4 July 1415 the Bull of Gregory XII which appointed Dominici and Malatesta as his proxies at the council was formally read before the assembled Bishops. The cardinal then read a decree of Gregory XII which convoked the council and authorized its succeeding acts. Thereupon, the Bishops voted to accept the summons. Prince Malatesta immediately informed the council that he was empowered by a commission from Pope Gregory XII to resign the Papal Throne on the Pontiff's behalf. He asked the council whether they would prefer to receive the abdication at that point or at a later date. The Bishops voted to receive the Papal abdication immediately. Thereupon the commission by Gregory XII authorizing his proxy to resign the Papacy on his behalf was read and Malatesta, acting in the name of Gregory XII, pronounced the resignation of the papacy by Gregory XII and handed a written copy of the resignation to the assembly.\n\nFormer Pope Gregory XII was then created titular [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Ruffina]] by the council, with rank immediately below the Pope (which made him the highest-ranking person in the church, since, due to his abdication, the See of Peter in Rome was vacant). Gregory XII's cardinals were accepted as true cardinals by the council, but the members of the council delayed electing a new pope for fear that a new pope would restrict further discussion of pressing issues in the church.\n\nBy the time the anti-popes were all deposed and the new Pope, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], was elected, two years had passed since Gregory XII's abdication, and Gregory was already dead. The council took great care to protect the legitimacy of the succession, ratified all his acts, and a new pontiff was chosen. The new pope, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], elected November 1417, soon asserted the absolute authority of the papal office.\n\n==Condemnation of Jan Hus==\n[[File:Vaclav Brozik - Hus.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of [[Jan Hus]] in Council of Constance by [[V\u00e1clav Bro\u017e\u00edk]]]]\nA second goal of the council was to continue the reforms begun at the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409). The reforms were largely directed against [[John Wycliffe]], mentioned in the opening session and condemned in the eighth on 4 May 1415, and [[Jan Hus]], along with their followers. Hus, summoned to Constance under a letter of [[safe conduct]], was found guilty of heresy by the council and turned over to the secular court. \"This holy synod of Constance, seeing that God's church has nothing more that it can do, relinquishes Jan Hus to the judgment of the secular authority and decrees that he is to be relinquished to the secular court.\" (Council of Constance Session 15 \u2013 6 July 1415). The secular court sentenced him to the stake.\n\n[[Jerome of Prague]], a supporter of Hus, came to Constance to offer assistance but was similarly arrested, judged, found guilty of heresy and turned over to the same secular court, with the same outcome as Hus. [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio Bracciolini]] attended the council and related the unfairness of the process against Jerome.<ref>William Shepherd, ''The Life of Poggio Bracciolini'', 1837, Ch. II, p. 68-81.

However, the peace was not stable and further conflicts arose regarding demarcation of the [[Samogitia]]n borders. The tensions erupted into the brief [[Hunger War]] in summer 1414. It was concluded that the disputes would be mediated by the Council of Constance.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian position was defended by [[Paulus Vladimiri]], rector of the [[Jagiellonian University]], who challenged legality of the Teutonic crusade. He argued that a forced conversion was incompatible with free will, which was an essential component of a genuine conversion.<ref name=chris/> Therefore, the Knights could only wage a defensive war if pagans violated [[natural rights]] of the Christians. Vladimiri further stipulated that infidels had rights which had to be respected, and neither the Pope nor the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] had the authority to violate them. Lithuanians also brought a group of Samogitian representatives to testify to atrocities committed by the Knights.<ref name=chris/>\n\nThe Dominican theologian [[John of Falkenberg]] proved to be the fiercest opponent of the Poles. In his ''Liber de doctrina'', Falkenberg argued that \"the Emperor has the right to slay even peaceful infidels simply because they are pagans.&nbsp;... The Poles deserve death for defending infidels, and should be exterminated even more than the infidels; they should be deprived of their sovereignty and reduced to slavery.\"<ref name=\"Cassar\"/> In ''Satira'', he attacked Polish-Lithuanian King [[Jogaila]], calling him a \"mad dog\" unworthy to be king. Falkenberg was condemned and imprisoned for such libel, but was not officially accused of heresy.<ref name=chris/> Other opponents included [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master's]] proctor Peter Wormditt, Dominic of San Gimignano, John Urbach, Ardecino de Porta of Novara, and [[Bishop of Ciudad Rodrigo]] Andrew Escobar. They argued that the Knights were perfectly justified in their crusade as it was a sacred duty of Christians to spread the true faith.<ref name=chris/> Cardinal [[Pierre d'Ailly]] published an independent opinion that attempted to somewhat balance both Polish and Teutonic positions.<ref name=chris/>\n\nThe council did not make any political decisions. It established the [[Diocese of Samogitia]], with its seat in [[Varniai|Medininkai]] and subordinated to Lithuanian dioceses, and appointed [[Matthias of Trakai]] as the first bishop. Pope Martin V appointed Polish-Lithuanian King [[Jogaila]] and Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] as [[vicars general]] in [[Pskov]] and [[Veliky Novgorod]] in recognition of their Catholicism.<ref name=chris/> After another round of futile negotiations, the [[Gollub War]] broke out in 1422. It ended with the [[Treaty of Melno]]. Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic wars continued for another hundred years.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Cassar\">doctor John Cassar ''The Rights of Nations: Reflections on the Address of Pope John Paul II to the 50th Session of the United Nations General Assembly'' Center for Global Education, St. John's University  1997</ref>\n<ref name=chris>{{cite book| first=Eric| last=Christiansen |title=The Northern Crusades |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1997 |edition=2nd |pages=231\u2013241 |isbn=0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Cantor, Norman F. 1993.

At this consultation, the MRMRM document was met with resistance, and concern was raised in particular that CUIC was focusing too narrowly on reconciliation of ministries and \"not taking seriously our commitment to working on those issues of systemic racism that remain at the heart of our continuing and separated life as churches here in the United States.\"<ref name=\"disciples2006\">{{cite web|last=Welsh |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=CUIC and the Dance of Ecumenism |work= |pages= |publisher= |date=November 2006 |url=http://www.disciples.org/ccu/fromthepresident/past/2006November.html |doi= |accessdate=15 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n=== Moravian Church (Northern Province) ===\nThe nine churches which inaugurated CUIC in 2002 were joined by the [[Moravian Church in North America|Moravian Church, Northern Province]].<ref name=\"disciples2006\"/> The Moravians had been partners in mission and dialogue since 2002, but joined as a member communion after the October 2006 consultation on Episkope.\n\n=== Suspension of activities ===\nIn 2007, the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] withdrew from CUIC.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ecumenical Group Limps as Two Churches Cut Ties | work = | pages = | publisher = The Christian Century | date = 1 July 2008 | url = http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2008-07/ecumenical-group-limps-two-churches-cut-ties | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref> Neither body sent representatives to the CUIC plenary on January 11\u201314, 2008, though the AME Council of Bishops never voted to suspend membership officially.<ref name=\"eif-pcusa2008\">{{cite web | last = Webb| first = Suzanne| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Letter from the President of CUIC | work = | pages = | publisher = United Methodist News Service | year = 2008 | url = http://eif-pcusa.org/EcumenicalRelations/documents/cuicstatusltr.pdf | doi = | accessdate = 28 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> They felt the other churches were not doing enough to counter the history of racial injustice between black and white churches.

Although the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] has not rejoined the group, efforts have continued to bring this communion back into membership. The Rev. Staccato Powell, an AMEZ pastor, preached at the 2011 CUIC plenary in Ft.

Concerns over the historic episcopate have been sidelined since 2008, though they may re-emerge. The group's focus on mutual reconciliation of ministries has been revisited in the light of racism and the impact that racism may have on exchanging ministers between denominations. Therefore, the coordinating council of CUIC created a consultation on race and ministry while also choosing to partner with the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference, a social justice organization involved in African American faith communities.<ref>{{cite web | last = Becker | first = Alex | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = CUIC Connects with the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference | work = | pages = | publisher = | date = | url = http://churchesunitinginchrist.org/news/51-cuic-connects-with-the-samuel-dewitt-proctor-conference | doi = | accessdate = 12 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of CUIC has always been unity (as reflected in their current slogan, \"reconciling the baptized, seeking unity with justice\").

CUIC has approached this goal of unity in various ways throughout its history.\n\n===Racism===\nRacism has been a primary focus of CUIC since 2002 (and, indeed, a primary focus of COCU alongside other forms of exclusion and prejudice, such as [[sexism]] and [[ableism]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Moede | first = Gerald | title = COCU 101 | journal = Mid-Stream | volume =  | issue =  | page = 76 | publisher =  | location = | date = Jan 2000 | issn =  }}</ref> According to Dan Krutz, former president of CUIC, \"Overcoming racism has been a focal point of CUIC since its beginning...

Until 2002, almost all member [[wikt:congregation|congregations]] of the CUC were also members of the UUA, and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, after an agreement between the CUC and the UUA, most services since 2002 have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations, with the UUA continuing to provide ministerial settlement services. Some Canadian congregations have continued to be members of both the CUC and UUA, while others are members of only the CUC.\n\nThe CUC is currently the only national body for [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregations in [[Canada]], and is a member of the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]].\n\n==Organization==\n[[Image:CUC Regions Map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A map of all four CUC regions]]\n\nThe CUC is made up of 46 member congregations and emerging groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuc.ca/congregations/ |title=Congregations|publisher=cuc.ca|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> who are the legal owners of the organization, and who are, for governance and service delivery, divided into four regions: \"BC\" ([[British Columbia]]), \"Western\" ([[Alberta]] to [[Thunder Bay]]), \"Central\" (between Thunder Bay and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]), and \"Eastern\" (Kingston, [[Ottawa]] and everything east of that).<ref>[http://cuc.ca/archive/programs/regions.htm Regions of the CUC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707054109/http://cuc.ca/archive/programs/regions.htm |date=July 7, 2012 }}</ref> However, for [[youth]] [[Youth ministry#Unitarian Universalism|ministry]], the \"Central\" and \"Eastern\" regions are combined to form a youth region known as \"QuOM\" (Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes), giving the youth only three regions for their activities.<ref>[http://cuc.ca/archive/youth/regions.htm Regions and Congregations<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407060453/http://cuc.ca/archive/youth/regions.htm |date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref> The organization as a whole is governed by the CUC Board of Trusties (Board),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuc.ca/board-of-trustees/ |title=CUC Board of Trustees|publisher=cuc.ca|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref> whose mandate it is to govern in the best interests of the CUC's owners. The Board is made up of 8 members who are elected by congregational delegates at the CUC's Annual General Meeting. This consists of two Trustees from each region, who are eligible to serve a maximum of two three-year terms. Board meetings also include Official Observers to the Board, who participate without a vote and represent UU Youth and Ministers.\n\n===Service delivery===\nAs members of the CUC, congregations and emerging groups are served by volunteer Service Consultants, Congregational Networks, and a series of other committees. There are two directors of regional services, one for the Western two regions, and one for the Eastern two regions. The Director of Lifespan Learning oversees development of [[religious education|religious exploration]] programming and youth and [[Young adult (psychology)|young adults]] are served by a Youth and Young Adult Ministry Development staff person.\n\n===Annual Conference and Meeting===\nPolicies and business of the CUC are determined at the '''Annual Conference and Meeting''' (ACM), consisting of the '''Annual Conference''', in which workshops are held, and the '''Annual General Meeting''', in which business matters and plenary meetings are performed. The ACM features two addresses, a '''Keynote''' and a '''Confluence Lecture'''. The Confluence Lecture is comparable to the UUA's Ware Lecture in prestige. In early days this event simply consisted of the Annual General Meeting component as the Annual Conference component was not added to much later. And starting in 2017 the conference portion will only tack place every second year.

The CUC had a [http://www.cuc.ca/statement/ task force] whose mandate was to consider revising them.<ref>[http://cuc.ca/principles-and-sources/ Principles and Sources]</ref>\n\nThe principles and sources as published in church literature and [http://cuc.ca/principles-and-sources/ on the CUC website]:\n\n{{quote|\n'''The Principles and Sources of our Religious Faith'''\n\n'''Principles'''\n\nWe, the member congregations of the Canadian Unitarian Council, covenant to affirm and promote:\n\n:*The inherent worth and dignity of every person;\n:*Justice, equity, and compassion in human relations;\n:*Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;\n:*A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;\n:*The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;\n:*The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;\n:*Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.\n\n'''Sources'''\n\nThe living tradition which we share draws from many sources:\n\n:*Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;\n:*Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;\n:*Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our [[ethical]] and spiritual life;\n:*Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbours as ourselves;\n::*Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of [[science]], and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit;\n:*Spiritual teachings of Earth-centred traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.\n\nGrateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision.

And also since 2002, some Canadian congregations have continued to be members of both the UUA and CUC while others are members of only the CUC.\n\nThe Canadian Unitarian Universalist youth of the day disapproved of the 2002 change in relationship between the CUC and UUA.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It is quite evident in the words of this statement, which was adopted by the attendees of the 2001 youth conference held at the Unitarian Church of Montreal: \n\n<blockquote>We the youth of Canada are deeply concerned about the direction the CUC seems to be taking. As stewards of our faith, adults have a responsibility to take into consideration the concerns of youth.

Changing the name of the CUC has occasionally been debated, but there have been no successful motions. To recognize this diversity, some members of the CUC abbreviate Unitarian Universalist as U*U (and playfully read it as \"You star, you\").<ref>[http://cuc.ca/archive/whos_who/ed/ed_letter_nov_2003.htm Unitarian*Universalist--You Star, You!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710221553/http://cuc.ca/archive/whos_who/ed/ed_letter_nov_2003.htm |date=July 10, 2015 }}</ref> Note, not all CUC members like this playful reading and so when these people write the abbreviation they leave out the star(*), just writing UU instead.<ref>[http://cuc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/canu_spring2004_final.pdf Letters to the Editor&nbsp;\u2014 NO ASTERISKS PLEASE]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n*[[First Unitarian Congregation of Toronto]]\n*[[Lotta Hitschmanova]]\n\n==References==\n{{Thirdpartysources|date=June 2013}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cuc.ca/ Official Website of The Canadian Unitarian Council]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/CanadianUnitarianCouncil Official Facebook Page of The Canadian Unitarian Council]\n*[http://www.usc-canada.org/ Unitarian Service Committee of Canada]\n*[http://cuc.ca/history/colony-to-nation/ The CUC: From Colony To Nation, 1961\u20132002]\n*[http://cuc.ca/congregations/ Unitarian Universalist Congregations in Canada]\n{{Unitarian, Universalist, and Unitarian Universalist topics}}\n\n[[Category:Unitarian Universalism in Canada]]\n[[Category:Unitarian Universalist organizations]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations based in Canada]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1961]]\n[[Category:Congregationalism in Canada]]\n[[Category:Congregational denominations established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:1961 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Supraorganizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations that support same-sex marriage]]", "sha1": "b3664tzdql55ozqnfjghwodtsuyn3pk"}}, {"title": "Clay math prize", "ns": "0", "id": "7666", "redirect": {"title": "Clay Mathematics Institute"}, "revision": {"id": "528536170", "parentid": "15905724", "timestamp": "2012-12-17T21:42:48Z", "contributor": {"username": "MZMcBride", "id": "212624"}, "comment": "[[bugzilla:42616]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]", "sha1": "q8h7su1w1e1dexq30537iibjugykt2x"}}, {"title": "Charles Mingus", "ns": "0", "id": "7668", "revision": {"id": "865846455", "parentid": "864548942", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T15:25:28Z", "contributor": {"ip": "198.138.209.234"}, "comment": "/* Early life and career */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist| <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Charles Mingus\n| image               = Charles Mingus 1976 cropped.jpg\n| caption             = Performance for the [[U.S. Bicentennial]], New York City, July 4, 1976<br />Photo by [[Tom Marcello]]\n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name          = Charles Mingus Jr.\n| birth_date          = {{birth date|1922|4|22}}\n| birth_place         = US Army Base in [[Nogales, Arizona]], United States\n| death_date          = {{death date and age|1979|1|5|1922|4|22}}\n| death_place         = [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico\n| origin              = Los Angeles, California, United States\n| instrument          = Double bass, piano, cello\n| genre               = [[Jazz]], [[hard bop]], [[bebop]], [[avant-garde jazz]], [[post-bop]], [[Third Stream]], [[orchestral jazz]], [[free jazz]]\n| occupation          = Musician, composer, bandleader\n| years_active        = 1943\u20131979\n| label               = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Candid Records|Candid]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Debut Records|Debut]], [[Impulse!

His father, Charles Mingus Sr., was a sergeant in the U.S. Army.<ref>Gene Santoro, ''Myself When I am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus'' (Oxford University Press, 1994); {{ISBN|0-19-509733-5}}</ref> Mingus was largely raised in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] area of Los Angeles. His maternal grandfather was a Chinese British subject from Hong Kong, and his maternal grandmother was an African-American from the southern United States. Mingus was the third great-grandson of the family's founding patriarch who was, by most accounts, a German immigrant. His ancestors included German American, African American, and Native American.<ref name=\"Santoro, 2000\">Santoro, 2000</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Todd|title=I Know What I Know: The Music of Charles Mingus|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=5}}</ref><ref name=Horton/>\n\nIn Mingus's autobiography ''[[Beneath the Underdog]]'' his mother was described as \"the daughter of an Englishman and a Chinese woman\", and his father was the son \"of a black farm worker and a Swedish woman\". Charles Mingus Sr. claims to have been raised by his mother and her husband as a white person until he was fourteen, when his mother revealed to her family that the child's true father was a black slave, after which he had to run away from his family and live on his own. The autobiography doesn't confirm whether Charles Mingus Sr. or Mingus himself believed this story was true, or whether it was merely an embellished version of the Mingus family's lineage.<ref name=\"autogenerated1991\">Mingus, Charles: ''Beneath the Underdog: His Life as Composed by Mingus''. New York, NY: Vintage, 1991.</ref>\n\nHis mother allowed only church-related music in their home, but Mingus developed an early love for other music, especially [[Duke Ellington]]. He studied trombone, and later cello, although he was unable to follow the cello professionally because, at the time, it was nearly impossible for a black musician to make a career of classical music, and the cello was not yet accepted as a jazz instrument. Despite this, Mingus was still attached to the cello; as he studied bass with [[Red Callender]] in the late 1930s, Callender even commented that the cello was still Mingus's main instrument. In ''Beneath the Underdog'', Mingus states that he did not actually start learning bass until [[Buddy Collette]] accepted him into his swing band under the stipulation that he be the band's bass player.<ref name=\"autogenerated1991\"/>\n\nDue to a poor education, the young Mingus could not read musical notation quickly enough to join the local youth orchestra. This had a serious impact on his early musical experiences, leaving him feeling ostracized from the classical music world. These early experiences, in addition to his lifelong confrontations with racism, were reflected in his music, which often focused on themes of racism, discrimination and (in)justice.<ref name=Horton>{{cite web|author=Horton, Ernest Aaron|title=Charles Mingus and the Paradoxical Aspects of Race as Reflected in His Life and Music|date=2007|url=http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-04072007-140228/unrestricted/ERonHortonDissertation.pdf|publisher=Doctoral dissertation, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the cello technique he learned was applicable to [[double bass]] when he took up the instrument in high school. He studied for five years with [[Herman Reinshagen]], principal bassist of the [[New York Philharmonic]], and compositional techniques with Lloyd Reese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=7105 |title=Charles Mingus &#124; Charles \"Baron\" Mingus: West Coast, 1945\u201349 |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |date=February 1, 2001 |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref> Throughout much of his career, he played a bass made in 1927 by the German maker [[Ernst Heinrich Roth]].\n\nBeginning in his teen years, Mingus was writing quite advanced pieces; many are similar to [[Third Stream]] because they incorporate elements of classical music. A number of them were recorded in 1960 with conductor [[Gunther Schuller]], and released as ''Pre-Bird'', referring to [[Charlie Parker|Charlie \"Bird\" Parker]]; Mingus was one of many musicians whose perspectives on music were altered by Parker into \"pre- and post-Bird\" eras.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nMingus gained a reputation as a bass prodigy. His first major professional job was playing with former Ellington clarinetist [[Barney Bigard]]. He toured with [[Louis Armstrong]] in 1943, and by early 1945 was recording in Los Angeles in a band led by [[Russell Jacquet]], which also included [[Teddy Edwards]], [[Maurice Simon]], [[Wild Bill Davis|Bill Davis]], and [[Chico Hamilton]], and in May that year, in Hollywood, again with Teddy Edwards, in a band led by [[Howard McGhee]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jazz Discography Project|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/charles-mingus/catalog|title=Charles Mingus Catalog|publisher=Jazzdisco.org|accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe then played with [[Lionel Hampton]]'s band in the late 1940s; Hampton performed and recorded several of Mingus's pieces. A popular trio of Mingus, [[Red Norvo]] and [[Tal Farlow]] in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim, but Mingus's race caused problems with club owners and he left the group. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist [[Wendell Marshall]]. Mingus's notorious temper led to his being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington ([[Bubber Miley]] and drummer [[Bobby Durham (jazz musician)|Bobby Durham]] are among the others), after an on-stage fight between Mingus and [[Juan Tizol]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hentoff, Nat|title=Jazz Is|publisher=W.H. Allen|year=1978|pages=34\u201335}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the early 1950s, before attaining commercial recognition as a bandleader, Mingus played gigs with [[Charlie Parker]], whose compositions and improvisations greatly inspired and influenced him. Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker's legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker's throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker's self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song, \"If [[Charlie Parker]] were a Gunslinger, There'd be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats\" (released on ''[[Mingus Dynasty]]'' as \"Gunslinging Bird\").{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nMingus was married four times, to Jeanne Gross, Lucille (Celia) Germanis, Judy Starkey, and Susan Graham Ungaro.<ref name=\"Santoro, 2000\"/>\n\n===Based in New York===\nIn 1961, Mingus spent time staying at the house of his mother's sister (Louise) and her husband, [[Fess Williams]] in Jamaica, Queens.<ref>Santoro, Gene. Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus. New York: Oxford UP, 2000. Print.</ref>  Subsequently, Mingus invited Williams to play at the 1962 Town Hall Concert. <ref> Santoro, Gene. \"Town Hall Train Wreck\" Village Voice, 2000.  Online, https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/06/06/town-hall-train-wreck/ </ref>\n\nIn 1952 Mingus co-founded [[Debut Records]] with [[Max Roach]] so he could conduct his recording career as he saw fit. The name originated from his desire to document unrecorded young musicians. Despite this, the best-known recording the company issued was of the most prominent figures in bebop. On May 15, 1953, Mingus joined [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Parker, [[Bud Powell]], and Roach for a concert at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, which is the [[Jazz at Massey Hall|last recorded documentation]] of Gillespie and Parker playing together. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in New York; the original version was issued later. The two 10\" albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any royalties \"for years and years\" for his Massey Hall appearance. The records, however, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings.\n\nOne story has it that Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a 1955 club date billed as a \"reunion\" with Parker, Powell, and Roach. Powell, who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness (possibly exacerbated by a severe police beating and electroshock treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell's incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting \"Bud Powell...Bud Powell...\" as if beseeching Powell's return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell's departure, to his own amusement and Mingus's exasperation. Mingus took another microphone and announced to the crowd, \"Ladies and Gentleman, please don't associate me with any of this. This is not jazz.  These are sick people.\"<ref>Santoro, Gene. Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus. New York: Oxford UP, 2000. Print.</ref> This was Parker's last public performance; about a week later he died after years of substance abuse.\n\nMingus often worked with a mid-sized ensemble (around 8\u201310 members) of rotating musicians known as the '''Jazz Workshop'''. Mingus broke new ground, constantly demanding that his musicians be able to explore and develop their perceptions on the spot. Those who joined the Workshop (or Sweatshops as they were colorfully dubbed by the musicians) included [[Pepper Adams]], [[Jaki Byard]], [[Booker Ervin]], [[John Handy]], [[Jimmy Knepper]], [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]] and [[Horace Parlan]]. Mingus shaped these musicians into a cohesive improvisational machine that in many ways anticipated [[free jazz]]. Some musicians dubbed the workshop a \"university\" for jazz.\n\n===''Pithecanthropus Erectus'' and other recordings===\nThe decade that followed <!--Followed what?--> is generally regarded as Mingus's most productive and fertile period. Over a ten-year period, made 30 records for a number of labels ([[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Candid Records|Candid]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Impulse! Records|Impulse]] and others), a pace perhaps unmatched by any other musicians except Ellington. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nMingus had already recorded around ten albums as a bandleader, but 1956 was a breakthrough year for him, with the release of ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'', arguably his first major work as both a bandleader and composer. Like Ellington, Mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind, and his band for ''Erectus'' included adventurous musicians: piano player [[Mal Waldron]], alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and the [[Sonny Rollins]]-influenced tenor of [[J. R. Monterose]]. The title song is a ten-minute [[tone poem]], depicting the rise of man from his [[hominidae|hominid]] roots (''[[Java Man|Pithecanthropus erectus]]'') to an eventual downfall. A section of the piece was [[free improvisation]], free of structure or theme.\n\nAnother album from this period, ''[[The Clown (album)|The Clown]]'' (1957 also on [[Atlantic Records]]), the title track of which features narration by humorist [[Jean Shepherd]], was the first to feature drummer [[Dannie Richmond]], who remained his preferred drummer until Mingus's death in 1979. The two men formed one of the most impressive and versatile [[rhythm section]]s in jazz. Both were accomplished performers seeking to stretch the boundaries of their music while staying true to its roots. When joined by pianist [[Jaki Byard]], they were dubbed \"The Almighty Three\".<ref>''Saying Something: Jazz Improvisation and Interaction,'' Ingrid Monson (University of Chicago Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-226-53478-2}}</ref>\n\n===''Mingus Ah Um'' and other works===\nIn 1959 Mingus and his jazz workshop musicians recorded one of his best-known albums, ''[[Mingus Ah Um]]''. Even in a year of standout masterpieces, including [[Dave Brubeck]]'s ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'', [[Miles Davis]]'s ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[John Coltrane]]'s ''[[Giant Steps]]'', and [[Ornette Coleman]]'s prophetic ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'', this was a major achievement, featuring such classic Mingus compositions as \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" (an elegy to [[Lester Young]]) and the vocal-less version of \"Fables of Faubus\" (a protest against segregationist Arkansas governor [[Orval E. Faubus]] that features double-time sections). Also during 1959, Mingus recorded the album ''[[Blues & Roots]]'', which was released the following year. As Mingus explained in his liner notes: \"I was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy, but I've grown up and I like to do things other than just swing. But blues can do more than just swing.\"\n\nMingus witnessed [[Ornette Coleman]]'s legendary\u2014and controversial\u20141960 appearances at New York City's [[Five Spot]] jazz club. He initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman's innovative music: \"...if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice, then I would say they were playing something...Most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they don't even know what's going to come out. They're experimenting.\" That same year, however, Mingus formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter [[Ted Curson]] and multi-instrumentalist [[Eric Dolphy]]. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman's quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. The quartet recorded on both ''[[Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus]]'' and ''[[Mingus (Charles Mingus album)|Mingus]]''.  The former also features the version of \"Fables of Faubus\" with lyrics, aptly titled \"Original Faubus Fables\".\n\nOnly one misstep occurred in this era: 1962's ''Town Hall Concert''. An ambitious program, it was plagued with troubles from its inception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/town-hall-train-wreck-6418362|title=Town Hall Train Wreck|author=Gene Santoro|date=June 6, 2000|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> Mingus's vision, now known as ''[[Epitaph (Charles Mingus composition)|Epitaph]]'', was finally realized by conductor [[Gunther Schuller]] in a concert in 1989, 10 years after Mingus's death.\n\n===''The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady'' and other Impulse! albums===\nIn 1963, Mingus released ''[[The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady]]'', a sprawling, multi-section masterpiece, described as \"one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history.\"<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-black-saint-and-the-sinner-lady-r143918/review Review at Allmusic], by Steve Huey. Retrieved December 5, 20115.</ref> The album was also unique in that Mingus asked his psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock, to provide notes for the record.\n\nMingus also released ''[[Mingus Plays Piano]]'', an unaccompanied album featuring some fully improvised pieces, in 1963.\n\nIn addition, 1963 saw the release of ''[[Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus]]'', an album  praised by critic [[Nat Hentoff]].<ref>Hentoff, Nat (1963). Liner Notes, ''Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus''.</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Mingus put together one of his best-known groups, a sextet including [[Dannie Richmond]], [[Jaki Byard]], [[Eric Dolphy]], trumpeter [[Johnny Coles]], and tenor saxophonist [[Clifford Jordan]]. The group was recorded frequently during its short existence; Coles fell ill and left during a European tour. Dolphy stayed in Europe after the tour ended, and died suddenly in Berlin on June 28, 1964. 1964 was also the year that Mingus met his future wife, [[Sue Mingus|Sue Graham Ungaro]]. The couple were married in 1966 by [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/iviews/smingus.htm |title=Jazz |publisher=AllAboutJazz.com |date=January 5, 1979 |accessdate=October 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112073954/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/iviews/smingus.htm |archivedate=November 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Facing financial hardship, Mingus was evicted from his New York home in 1966.\n\n===''Changes''===\nMingus's pace slowed somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, after his 1970 sextet with Charles McPherson, Eddie Preston and Bobby Jones disbanded, he formed a quintet with Richmond, pianist [[Don Pullen]], trumpeter [[Jack Walrath]] and saxophonist [[George Adams (musician)|George Adams]]. They recorded two well-received albums, ''[[Changes One (Mingus)|Changes One]]'' and ''[[Changes Two]]''. Mingus also played with [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]] in many of his groups during this time. ''Cumbia and Jazz Fusion'' in 1976 sought to blend Colombian music (the \"[[Cumbia]]\" of the title) with more traditional jazz forms. In 1971, Mingus taught for a semester at the [[University at Buffalo|University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] as the Slee Professor of Music.<ref>Blanchet, Benjamin. [http://www.ubspectrum.com/article/2016/11/charles-mingus-at-ub \"Spring semester of '71\"], ''The Spectrum'', [[University at Buffalo|University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]], 21 November 2016. Retrieved on 21 November 2016.</ref>\n\n===Later career and death===\nBy the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS). His once formidable bass technique declined until he could no longer play the instrument. He continued composing, however, and supervised a number of recordings before his death. At the time of his death, he was working with [[Joni Mitchell]] on an album eventually titled ''[[Mingus (Joni Mitchell album)|Mingus]]'', which included lyrics added by Mitchell to his compositions, including \"[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]\". The album featured the talents of [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and another influential bassist and composer, [[Jaco Pastorius]].\n\nMingus died, aged 56, in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the [[Ganges River]].\n\n== Musical Style ==\nHis compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of [[hard bop]], drawing heavily from black [[gospel music]] and [[blues]], while sometimes containing elements of [[Third Stream]], [[free jazz]], and [[classical music]]. He once cited [[Duke Ellington]] and church as his main influences.\n\nMingus espoused collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, he looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists, whom he utilized to assemble unconventional instrumental configurations. As a performer, Mingus was a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument's most proficient players.\n\nBecause of his brilliant writing for midsize ensembles, and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups, Mingus is often considered the heir of [[Duke Ellington]], for whom he expressed great admiration and collaborated on the record ''[[Money Jungle]]''. Indeed, [[Dizzy Gillespie]] had once claimed Mingus reminded him \"of a young Duke\", citing their shared \"organizational genius.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzinchicago.org/educates/journal/reviews/myself-when-i-am-real-life-and-music-charles-mingus|title=Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus, by Gene Santoro|author=David Simpson|publisher=Jazz Institute of Chicago book review|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and temper==\nNearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus's often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname \"The Angry Man of Jazz\". His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many onstage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals.<ref>Jon Pareles, [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/arts/an-irrepressible-65-mingus-concert.html?&pagewanted=all \"An irrepressible  '65 Mingus concert\"], ''The New York Times'', September 23, 1984.</ref> Although respected for his musical talents, Mingus was sometimes feared for his occasionally violent onstage temper, which was at times directed at members of his band and other times aimed at the audience.<ref name=\"wynnkatz\">{{Citation |last=Wynn |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Wynn |last2=Katz |first2=Mike |editor=Ron Wynn|others=M.

The three of us just wailed on the blues for about an hour and a half before he called the other cats back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackieparis.com/sizzles.htm|title=Paris When He Sizzles|work=Village Voice |author=Will Friedwald}}</ref>\n\nOn October 12, 1962, Mingus punched [[Jimmy Knepper]] in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus' apartment on a score for his upcoming concert at [[The Town Hall]] in New York, and Knepper refused to take on more work. Mingus' blow broke off a crowned tooth and its underlying stub.<ref>Santoro, 2000.</ref><!-- (that's the ''Village Voice'' article cited earlier) --> According to Knepper, this ruined his [[embouchure]] and resulted in the permanent loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone \u2013 a significant handicap for any professional trombonist. This attack temporarily ended their working relationship, and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. Knepper did again work with Mingus in 1977 and played extensively with the [[Mingus Dynasty (band)|Mingus Dynasty]], formed after Mingus' death in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-knepper-548287.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903104348/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-knepper-548287.html|archivedate=September 3, 2010 |title=Jimmy Knepper \u2013 Obituaries, News |author=Voce, Steve|authorlink=Steve Voce|work=The Independent |date= June 16, 2003|accessdate=October 8, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to bouts of ill temper, Mingus was prone to [[clinical depression]] and tended to have brief periods of extreme creative activity intermixed with fairly long stretches of greatly decreased output, such as the five-year period following the death of Eric Dolphy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/argument-instruments-charles-mingus/|title=An Argument With Instruments: On Charles Mingus {{!}} The Nation|last=Shatz|first=Adam|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Mingus was evicted from his apartment at 5 Great Jones Street in New York City for nonpayment of rent, captured in the 1968 [[documentary film]] ''[[Mingus: Charlie Mingus 1968]]'', directed by Thomas Reichman. The film also features Mingus performing in clubs and in the apartment, firing a [[.410 bore|.410 shotgun]] indoors, composing at the piano, playing with and taking care of his young daughter Caroline, and discussing love, art, politics, and the music school he had hoped to create.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mingus 1968|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKuwFVDmt5I|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===The Mingus Big Band===\n\nCharles Mingus' music is currently being performed and reinterpreted by the [[Mingus Big Band]], which in October 2008 began playing every Monday at Jazz Standard in New York City, and often tours the rest of the U.S. and Europe. The [[Mingus Big Band]], the Mingus Orchestra, and the [[Mingus Dynasty (band)|Mingus Dynasty]] band are managed by Jazz Workshop, Inc. and run by Mingus' widow Sue Graham Mingus.\n\n[[Elvis Costello]] has written lyrics for a few Mingus pieces. He had once sung lyrics for one piece, \"Invisible Lady\", backed by the Mingus Big Band on the album, ''Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r584078|pure_url=yes}}|title= Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love|work=Album overview on Allmusic}}</ref>\n\n===''Epitaph''===\n''[[Epitaph (Charles Mingus composition)|Epitaph]]'' is considered one of Charles Mingus' masterpieces. The composition is 4,235 measures long, requires two hours to perform, and is one of the longest jazz pieces ever written. ''Epitaph'' was only completely discovered, by musicologist Andrew Homzy, during the cataloging process after Mingus' death. With the help of a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]]. This concert was produced by Mingus' widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at [[Alice Tully Hall]] on June 3, 1989, 10 years after Mingus' death. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007. The performance at Walt Disney Concert Hall is available on NPR. Hal Leonard published the complete score in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Autobiography===\nMingus wrote the sprawling, exaggerated, quasi-autobiography, ''[[Beneath the Underdog|Beneath the Underdog: His World as Composed by Mingus]]'',<ref name=\"autogenerated1991\"/> throughout the 1960s, and it was published in 1971. Its \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" style covered several aspects of his life that had previously been off-record. In addition to his musical and intellectual proliferation, Mingus goes into great detail about his perhaps overstated sexual exploits. He claims to have had more than 31 affairs in the course of his life (including 26 prostitutes in one sitting). This does not include any of his five wives (he claims to have been married to two of them simultaneously). In addition, he asserts that he held a brief career as a pimp. This has never been confirmed.\n\nMingus's autobiography also serves as an insight into his psyche, as well as his attitudes about race and society.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ratliff |first=Ben |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E3D81339F93BA25752C0A96E958260 |title=JAZZ VIEW; Hearing Mingus Again, Seeing Him Anew|work=The New York Times |date=January 18, 1998 |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref> It includes accounts of abuse at the hands of his father from an early age, being bullied as a child, his removal from a white musician's union, and grappling with disapproval while married to white women and other examples of the hardship and prejudice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940521-2,00.html |title=Jazz: Beneath the Underdog |work=Time |date=October 2, 1964 |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Scholarly influence===\nThe work of Charles Mingus has also received attention in academic spaces. According to Ashon Crawley, the musicianship of Charles Mingus provides a salient example of the power of music to unsettle the dualistic, categorical distinction of sacred from profane through otherwise epistemologies.<ref>Crawley, Ashon T. 2017. Blackpentecostal Breath: The Aesthetics of Possibility. New York: Fordham University Press. </ref> Crawley offers a reading of Mingus that examines the deep, imbrication uniting Holiness-Pentecostal aesthetic practices and jazz. Mingus recognized the importance and impact of the midweek gathering of black folks at the Holiness-Pentecostal Church at 79th and Watts in Los Angeles that he'd attend with his stepmother or his friend Britt Woodman.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Crawley goes on to argue that these visits were the impetus for the song \"Wednesday Prayer Meeting.\" Emphasis is placed on the ethical demand of the prayer meeting felt and experienced that, according to Crawley, Mingus attempts to capture. In many ways, \"Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting\" was Mingus's memorial, homage, to black sociality. By exploring Mingus' homage to black Pentecostal aesthetics, Crawley expounds on how Mingus figured out that those Holiness-Pentecostal gatherings were the constant repetition of the ongoing, deep, intense mode of study, a kind of study wherein the aesthetic forms created could not be severed from the intellectual practice because they were one and also, but not, the same<ref>Ibid</ref>.\" [[Gunther Schuller]] has suggested that Mingus should be ranked among the most important American composers, jazz or otherwise.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1988, a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]<ref name=\"arts.endow.gov\">[http://arts.endow.gov/about/40th/mingus.html NEA press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035420/http://arts.endow.gov/about/40th/mingus.html|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref> made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library]]<ref>[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b11250454 NYPL catalog page.]</ref> for public use. In 1993, [[The Library of Congress]] acquired Mingus's collected papers\u2014including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos\u2014in what they described as \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history\".<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/1993/93-081.html \"Library of Congress Acquires Charles Mingus Collection\"], June 11, 1993. Library of Congress press release.</ref>\n\n===Cover versions===\nConsidering the number of compositions that Charles Mingus wrote, his works have not been recorded as often as comparable jazz composers. The only Mingus tribute albums recorded during his lifetime were baritone saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]]'s album, ''[[Pepper Adams Plays the Compositions of Charlie Mingus]]'', in 1963, and [[Joni Mitchell]]'s album ''[[Mingus (Joni Mitchell album)|Mingus]]'', in 1979. Of all his works, his elegant elegy for [[Lester Young]], \"[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]\" (from ''[[Mingus Ah Um]]'') has probably had the most recordings. Besides recordings from the expected jazz artists, the song has also been recorded by musicians as disparate as [[Jeff Beck]], [[Andy Summers]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], and [[Bert Jansch]] and [[John Renbourn]] with and without [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]. [[Joni Mitchell]] sang a version with lyrics that she wrote for it.\n\n[[Elvis Costello]] has recorded \"Hora Decubitus\" (from ''[[Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus]]'') on ''My Flame Burns Blue'' (2006). \"Better Git It in Your Soul\" was covered by [[Davey Graham]] on his album \"Folk, Blues, and Beyond.\" Trumpeter Ron Miles performs a version of \"Pithecanthropus Erectus\" on his CD \"Witness.\" New York Ska Jazz Ensemble has done a cover of Mingus's \"Haitian Fight Song\", as have the British folk rock group Pentangle and others. [[Hal Willner]]'s 1992 tribute album ''Weird Nightmare: Meditations on Mingus'' ([[Columbia Records]]) contains idiosyncratic renditions of Mingus's works involving numerous popular musicians including [[Chuck D]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Dr. John]]. The Italian band [[Quintorigo]] recorded an entire album devoted to Mingus's music, titled ''Play Mingus''.\n\n[[Gunther Schuller]]'s edition of Mingus's \"Epitaph\" which premiered at [[Lincoln Center]] in 1989 was subsequently released on Columbia/Sony Records.\n\nOne of the most elaborate tributes to Mingus came on September 29, 1969, at a festival honoring him. [[Duke Ellington]] performed ''The Clown'', with Duke reading [[Jean Shepherd]]'s narration. It was long believed that no recording of this performance existed; however, one was discovered and premiered on July 11, 2013, by Dry River Jazz host [http://krwg.org/people/trevor-hodgkins Trevor Hodgkins] for NPR member station KRWG-FM with re-airings on July 13, 2013, and July 26, 2014.<ref name=\"Dry River Jazz\">{{cite web|last1=Hodgkins|first1=Trevor|url=http://composer.nprstations.org/widgets/v2/playlist/index.html?ucs=5182a3a6e1c8428d5e122298&prog_id=5182a3abe1c8428d5e1222a7&dateFilter=2014-07-26|title=Dry River Jazz 07/26/2014|website=composer.nprstations.org}}</ref> Mingus's elegy for Duke, \"Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love\", was recorded by [[Kevin Mahogany]] on ''Double Rainbow'' (1993) and [[Anita Wardell]] on ''Why Do You Cry?''

Cartoons]] on the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts. He wrote, produced, and/or directed many classic [[animated cartoon]] shorts starring [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Michigan J. Frog]], the [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|Three Bears]], and a slew of other Warner characters.\n\nAfter his career at Warner Bros. ended in 1962, Jones started [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|Sib Tower 12 Productions]], and began producing cartoons for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], including a new series of [[Tom and Jerry, The Chuck Jones Collection|''Tom and Jerry'' shorts]] and the television adaptation of [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (animated short)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''. He later started his own studio, Chuck Jones Enterprises, which created several one-shot specials, and periodically worked on ''Looney Tunes'' related works.\n\nJones was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] eight times and won three times, receiving awards for the cartoons ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'', ''[[So Much for So Little]]'', and ''[[The Dot and the Line]]''. He received an [[Honorary Academy Award]] in 1996 for his work in the animation industry. Film historian [[Leonard Maltin]] has praised Jones' work at Warner Bros., MGM and Chuck Jones Enterprises. He also said that the \"feud\" that there may have been between Jones and colleague [[Bob Clampett]] was mainly because they were so different from each other. In [[Jerry Beck]]'s ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', ten of the entries were directed by Jones, with four out of the five top cartoons being Jones shorts.\n\n==Early life==\nJones was born on September 21, 1912, in [[Spokane, Washington]], the son of Mabel McQuiddy (Martin) and Charles Adams Jones.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bZIv8NKfNKwC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22Mabel+McQuiddy+Martin%22&source=bl&ots=nceIX_M8XR&sig=6MgcU4mceA5fAK-nxqBcXyUlK40&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8uyDVZ-bFMbn-AHgyYGACQ&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg|title=Chuck Jones: A Flurry of Drawings|author1=Hugh Kenner|author2=Chuck Jones|page=22|website=Books.google.ca|accessdate=2017-05-04}}</ref> He later moved with his parents and three siblings to the Los Angeles, California area.<ref name=obit/>\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Chuck Amuck'', Jones credits his artistic bent to circumstances surrounding his father, who was an unsuccessful businessman in California in the 1920s. His father, Jones recounts, would start every new business venture by purchasing new stationery and new pencils with the company name on them. When the business failed, his father would quietly turn the huge stacks of useless stationery and pencils over to his children, requiring them to use up all the material as fast as possible. Armed with an endless supply of high-quality paper and pencils, the children drew constantly. Later, in one art school class, the professor gravely informed the students that they each had 100,000 bad drawings in them that they must first get past before they could possibly draw anything worthwhile. Jones recounted years later that this pronouncement came as a great relief to him, as he was well past the 200,000 mark, having used up all that stationery. Jones and several of his siblings went on to artistic careers.<ref>Jones, Chuck (1989).

''Chuck Reducks: Drawing from the Fun Side of Life''. New York: Warner Books; {{ISBN|0-446-51893-X}}</ref>\n\nDuring his artistic education, he worked part-time as a janitor. After graduating from [[Chouinard Art Institute]], Jones got a phone call from a friend named Fred Kopietz, who had been hired by the [[Ub Iwerks]] studio and offered him a job. He worked his way up in the animation industry, starting as a cel washer; \"then I moved up to become a painter in black and white, some color. Then I went on to take animator's drawings and traced them onto the celluloid. Then I became what they call an in-betweener, which is the guy that does the drawing between the drawings the animator makes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon1int-3|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727215042/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon1int-3 |archivedate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> While at Iwerks, he met a cel painter named Dorothy Webster, who later became his first wife.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jasmin|date=May 7, 2009|title=Chuck Jones \u2013 Master Animator|url=|journal=New York Post|volume=|page=34|via=Business Insights: Global}}</ref>\n\n==Warner Bros.==\n{{See also|Chuck Jones filmography}}\nJones joined [[Leon Schlesinger|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], the independent studio that produced ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]], in 1933 as an assistant animator. In 1935, he was promoted to animator, and assigned to work with new Schlesinger director [[Tex Avery]]. There was no room for the new Avery unit in Schlesinger's small studio, so Avery, Jones, and fellow animators [[Bob Clampett]], [[Virgil Ross]], and [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] were moved into a small adjacent building they dubbed \"Termite Terrace\". When Clampett was promoted to director in 1937, Jones was assigned to his unit; the Clampett unit was briefly assigned to work with Jones' old employer, [[Ub Iwerks]] when Iwerks subcontracted four cartoons to Schlesinger in 1937. Jones became a director (or \"supervisor\", the original title for an animation director in the studio) himself in 1938 when [[Frank Tashlin]] left the studio. The following year Jones created his first major character, [[Sniffles]], a cute Disney-style mouse, who went on to star in twelve Warner Bros. cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chuckjonescenter.org/characters/sniffles|title=Sniffles|website=Chuck Jones Center|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe was actively involved in efforts to unionize the staff of [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Studios]]. He was responsible for recruiting animators, layout men, and background people. Almost all animators joined, in reaction to salary cuts imposed by [[Leon Schlesinger]]. The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]] had already signed a union contract, encouraging their counterparts under Schlesinger.<ref name=\"Sigall\">Sigall (2005), pp. 59\u201361</ref> In a meeting with his staff, Schlesinger talked for a few minutes, then turned over the meeting to his attorney. His insulting manner had a unifying effect on the staff. Jones gave a pep talk at the union headquarters. As negotiations broke down, the staff decided to go on strike. Schlesinger locked them out of the studio for a few days, before agreeing to sign the contract.<ref name=\"Sigall\"/> A Labor Management Committee was formed and Jones served as a moderator. Because of his role as a supervisor in the studio, he could not himself join the union.<ref name=\"Sigall\"/> Jones created many of his lesser-known characters during this period, including [[Charlie Dog]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], and [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|The Three Bears]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[File:The Outpost.ogv|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:59|'Outpost', a Private Snafu cartoon directed by Chuck Jones in 1944]]\nDuring [[World War II]], Jones worked closely with Theodor Geisel, better known as [[Dr. Seuss]], to create the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of Army educational cartoons (the character was created by director [[Frank Capra]]). Jones later collaborated with Seuss on animated adaptations of Seuss' books, including ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' in 1966. Jones directed such shorts as ''[[The Weakly Reporter]]'', a 1944 short that related to shortages and rationing on the home front. During the same year, he directed ''[[Hell-Bent for Election]]'', a campaign film for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0005062|Chuck Jones}}</ref>\n\nJones created characters through the late 1940s and the 1950s, which include [[Claude Cat]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]], [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters#Charlie Dog|Charlie Dog]], [[Michigan J. Frog]], and his four most popular creations, [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner]]. Jones and writer [[Michael Maltese]] collaborated on the Road Runner cartoons, ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'', and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''. Other staff at Unit A that Jones collaborated with include layout artist, background designer, co-director [[Maurice Noble]]; animator and co-director [[Abe Levitow]]; and animators [[Ken Harris]] and [[Ben Washam]].\n\nJones remained at Warner Bros. throughout the 1950s, except for a brief period in 1953 when Warner closed the animation studio. During this interim, Jones found employment at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], where he teamed with [[Ward Kimball]] for a four-month period of uncredited work on ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). Upon the reopening of the Warner animation department, Jones was rehired and reunited with most of his unit.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn the early 1960s, Jones and his wife Dorothy wrote the screenplay for the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]''. The finished film would feature the voices of [[Judy Garland]], [[Robert Goulet]] and [[Red Buttons]] as cats in Paris, France. The feature was produced by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and directed by his former Warner Bros.  collaborator, Abe Levitow.\n\nJones moonlighted to work on the film since he had an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. UPA completed the film and made it available for distribution in 1962; it was picked up by Warner Bros. When Warner Bros. discovered that Jones had violated his exclusive contract with them, they terminated him.<ref name=\"endofstudio\">Barrier, Michael (1999). ''Hollywood Cartoons''.

Cartoons studio was closed in early 1963.<ref name=\"endofstudio\"/>\n\n==Post-Warner Bros.==\nWith business partner Les Goldman, Jones started an independent animation studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions, and brought on most of his unit from Warner Bros., including Maurice Noble and Michael Maltese. In 1963, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contracted with Sib Tower 12 to have Jones and his staff produce new ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons as well as a television adaptation of all ''Tom and Jerry'' theatricals produced to that date. This included major editing, including writing out the African-American maid, Mammy Two-Shoes, and replacing her with one of Irish descent voiced by [[June Foray]]. In 1964, Sib Tower 12 was absorbed by MGM and was renamed [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]]. His animated short film, ''[[The Dot and the Line|The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics]]'', won the 1965 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]. Jones directed the classic animated short ''[[The Bear That Wasn't]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nAs the ''Tom and Jerry'' series wound down (it was discontinued in 1967), Jones produced more for television. In 1966, he produced and directed the TV special ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]!'', featuring the voice and facial models based on the readings by [[Boris Karloff]].<ref name=bcdb>{{bcdb|15585|How The Grinch Stole Christmas!}}</ref>\n\nJones continued to work on other TV specials such as ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1970), but his main focus during this time was producing the feature film ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', which did lukewarm business when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] released it in 1970. Jones co-directed 1969's ''The Pogo Special Birthday Special'', based on the [[Walt Kelly]] comic strip, and voiced the characters of Porky Pine and Bun Rab. It was at this point that he decided to start ST Incorporated.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nMGM closed the animation division in 1970, and Jones once again started his own studio, Chuck Jones Enterprises. He produced a Saturday morning children's TV series for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] called ''[[Curiosity Shop|The Curiosity Shop]]'' in 1971. In 1973, he produced an animated version of the [[George Selden (author)|George Selden]] book ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]'' and would go on to produce two sequels.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nThree of his works during this period were animated TV adaptations of short stories from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Mowgli's Brothers (TV special)|Mowgli's Brothers]]'', ''[[The White Seal]]'' and ''[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]''. During this period, Jones began to experiment with more realistically designed characters, most of which having larger eyes, leaner bodies, and altered proportions, such as those of the Looney Tunes characters.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nJones resumed working with Warner Bros. in 1976 with the animated TV adaptation of ''[[Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals|The Carnival of the Animals]]'' with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Jones also produced the 1979 film ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'' which was a compilation of Jones' best theatrical shorts; Jones produced new Road Runner shorts for ''[[The Electric Company]]'' series and ''Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales'' (1979), and even newer shorts were made for ''Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over'' (1980).<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nFrom 1977 to 1978, Jones wrote and drew the newspaper comic strip ''Crawford'' (also known as ''Crawford & Morgan'') for the [[Tribune Media Services|Chicago Tribune-NY News Syndicate]].

Their correspondence was never published in the media. It was forwarded to [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]], who conducted the interview with Clampett and was distributed by Jones to multiple people concerned with animation over the years.

These have been in vogue for thousands of years and have developed into a distinctive dress style. The dress worn by men is known as [[Gho]] which is a robe worn up to knee-length and is fastened at the waist by a band called the [[Kera (clothing)|Kera]]. The front part of the dress which is formed like a pouch, in olden days was used to hold baskets of food and short dagger, but now it is used to keep cell phone, purse and the [[betel nut]] called ''Doma''. The dress worn by women consist of three pieces known as [[Kira (Bhutan)|Kira]], [[Toego|Tego]] and [[Wonju]]. The long dress which extends up to the ankle is Kira. The jacket worn above this is Tego which is provided with Wonju, the inner jacket. However, while visiting the [[Dzong]] or monastery a long scarf or stoll, called [[Kabney]] is worn by men across the shoulder, in colours appropriate to their ranks. Women also wear scarfs or stolls called [[Rachus]], made of raw silk with embroidery, over their shoulder but not indicative of their rank.<ref name=Council>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/bhutanese-dress|title=Bhutanese Dress|accessdate=17 October 2015|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan}}</ref>\n\n== Theatrical costume ==\n{{Main|Stage clothes}}\n[[File:Samurai actors.jpg|thumb|upright|Actors in [[samurai]] costume at the [[Kyoto]] [[Toei Kyoto Studio Park|Eigamura]] film set]]\n[[File:yakshagana vesha.jpg|thumb|upright|A costume used in [[yakshagana]], a theater art from [[India]]]]\n[[File:Purpledoublet.jpg|thumb|upright|Costumed performers from [[Bristol Renaissance Faire]]]]\n\n\"Costume\" often refers to a particular style of clothing worn to portray the wearer as a [[Character (arts)|character]] or type of character at a social event in a [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] on the [[Stagecraft|stage]] or in film or television. In combination with other aspects of stagecraft, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' and their contexts as well as communicate information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, season or weather of the theatrical performance. Some stylized theatrical costumes, such as [[Harlequin]] and [[Trousers|Pantaloon]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]], exaggerate an aspect of a character.\n\n== Religious festivals ==\n[[File:Oldfashioned.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A traditional, European-style [[Santa suit]]]]\nThe wearing of costumes is an important part of [[holidays]] developed from religious [[festival]]s such as [[Mardi Gras]] (in the lead up to [[Easter]]), and Halloween (related to [[All Hallow's Eve]]). [[French Quarter Mardi Gras costumes|Mardi Gras costumes]] usually take the form of [[jester]]s and other fantasy characters; [[Halloween costume]]s traditionally take the form of [[supernatural]] creatures such as [[ghosts]], [[vampires]], pop-culture icons and [[angels]]. In modern times. Christmas costumes typically portray characters such as [[Santa Claus]] (developed from [[Saint Nicholas]]). In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States the American version of a [[Santa suit]] and [[beard]] is popular; in the Netherlands, the costume of [[Zwarte Piet]] is customary. Easter costumes are associated with the [[Easter Bunny]] or other [[costumed character|animal costumes]].\n\nIn [[Judaism]], a common practice is to dress up on [[Purim]]. During this holiday, Jews celebrate the change of their destiny. They were delivered from being the victims of an evil decree against them and were instead allowed by the King to destroy their enemies. A quote from the [[Book of Esther]], which says: \"On the contrary\" ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0}}) is the reason that wearing a costume has become customary for this holiday.\n\nBuddhist religious festivals in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], Mongolia and [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]] and [[Sikkim]] in India  perform the [[Cham dance]], which is a popular dance form utilising masks and costumes.<ref name=\"Pearlman\">{{cite book|title=Tibetan Sacred Dance: a Journey into the Religious and Folk Traditions |first=Ellen |last=Pearlman |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear & Co |year=2002 |pages=21, 32, 180 |isbn=0-89281-918-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JX-gKEJPszwC |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife: Southeast Asia and India, Central and East Asia, Middle East |volume=2 |first=William M. |last=Clements |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-313-32849-8 |pages=106\u2013110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Dance\">{{cite web|url=https://dancehistorydevelopment.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/cham-dance-the-masked-ritual/|publisher=History and Development of Dance/ Brockport|title=Cham Dance: The Masked Ritual|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=18 October 2015|work=World Press.com}}</ref>\n\n== Parades and processions ==\nParades and processions provide opportunities for people to dress up in historical or imaginative costumes. For example, in 1879 the artist [[Hans Makart]] designed costumes and scenery to celebrate the wedding anniversary of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and Empress and led the people of Vienna in a costume parade that became a regular event until the mid-twentieth century. [[Uncle Sam]] costumes are worn on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the United States. The [[Lion dance|Lion Dance]], which is part of Chinese New Year celebrations, is performed in costume. Some costumes, such as the ones used in the [[Dragon dance|Dragon Dance]], need teams of people to create the required effect.\n\n== Sporting events and parties ==\nPublic sporting events such as [[fun run]]s also provide opportunities for wearing costumes, as do private [[masquerade ball]]s and [[fancy dress party|fancy dress parties]].\n\n=== Mascots ===\n[[File:Steinbockzunft Taisersdorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Capra (genus)|Ibex]] costumes]]\nCostumes are popularly employed at sporting events, during which fans dress as their team's representative [[mascot]] to show their support. Businesses use mascot costumes to bring in people to their business either by placing their mascot in the street by their business or sending their mascot out to sporting events, festivals, national celebrations, fairs, and parades. Mascots appear at organizations wanting to raise awareness of their work. Children's Book authors create mascots from the main character to present at their book signings. Animal costumes that are visually very similar to mascot costumes are also popular among the members of the [[furry fandom]], where the costumes are referred to as [[fursuit]]s and match one's animal persona, or \"fursona\".\n\n=== Children ===\nCostumes also serve as an avenue for children to explore and role-play. For example, children may dress up as characters from history or fiction, such as pirates, [[princesses]], cowboys, or superheroes. They may also dress in [[uniform]]s used in common jobs, such as nurses, police officers, or firefighters, or as zoo or farm animals. Young boys tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical ideas of being male, and young girls tend to prefer costumes that reinforce stereotypical ideas of being female.<ref>{{cite book|title = Rituals and Patterns in Children's Lives|publisher = Popular Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-299-20830-1|location = |page = 225|editor-last = Jackson|editor-first = Kathy Merlock}}</ref>\n\n=== Cosplay ===\n{{Main|Cosplay}}\n[[Cosplay]], a word of Japanese origin that in English is short for \"costume play\", is a performance art in which participants wear costumes and accessories to represent a specific character or idea that is usually always identified with a unique name (as opposed to a generic word). These costume wearers often interact to create a subculture centered on role play, so they can be seen most often in play groups, or at a gathering or convention. A significant number of these costumes are homemade and unique, and depend on the character, idea, or object the costume wearer is attempting to imitate or represent. The costumes themselves are often artistically judged to how well they represent the subject or object that the costume wearer is attempting to contrive.\n\n== Design ==\n{{Main|Costume design}}\n[[Costume design]] is the envisioning of clothing and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world that is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for, but not limited to, theater, cinema, or musical performances. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination, which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both processes are used to create stage clothes.\n\n=== Organizations ===\nThe [[Costume Designers Guild]]'s international membership includes motion picture, television, and commercial [[costume designer]]s, assistant costume designers and costume illustrators, and totals over 750 members.\n\n=== Publications ===\n''The Costume Designer'' is a quarterly magazine devoted to the costume design industry.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://costumedesignersguild.com/magazine/ |title=Current Issue |journal=The Costume Designer |publisher=[[Costume Designers Guild]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable designers and awards ===\n[[List of costume designers|Notable costume designers]] include recipients of the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design]], and [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design]]. [[Edith Head]] and [[Orry-Kelly]], both of whom were born late in 1897, were two of  Hollywood's most notable costume designers.\n\n=== DIY and homemade costumes ===\nIn the 20th century, contemporary fabric stores offered commercial patterns that could be bought and used to make a costume from raw materials. Some companies also began producing catalogs with great numbers of patterns.\n\nMore recently, and particularly with the advent of the Internet, the [[Do it yourself|DIY movement]] has ushered in a new era of DIY costumes and pattern sharing. [[PopSugar|POPSUGAR]] is one such example, with several hundred designs readily available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popsugar.com/latest/DIY-costumes |publisher=PopSugar |title=DIY Costumes}}</ref> [[YouTube]], [[Pinterest]], [[Mashable]] also feature many DIY costumes.\n\n== Industry ==\nProfessional-grade costumes are typically designed and produced by artisan crafters, often specifically for a particular character or setting. Specialty shops may also include common costumes of this caliber.\n\nSome high-end costumes may even be designed by the costume's wearer.\n\nThe costume industry includes vendors such the American company [[Spencer Gifts|Spirit Halloween]], which opens consumer-oriented stores seasonally with pre-made [[Halloween costume]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Theatre|Holidays|Fashion}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Best Costume Design (disambiguation)|Best Costume Design]]\n* [[Costumed character]]\n* [[Costume drama]]\n* [[Costume jewelry]]\n* [[Costume museum (disambiguation)|Costume museum]]\n* [[Illusion costume]]\n* [[List of costume designers]]\n* [[Persona]]\n* [[World Costume Festival]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Costumes}}\n*http://costumesocietyamerica.com/\n*[http://www.costumesociety.org.uk/ The Costume Society, UK]\n*[http://www.costumers.org/ National Costumers Association]\n*{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Costume |volume=7 |pages=224\u2013248 |short=1}}\n\n{{Clothing}}\n{{Theatre}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Costume design]]\n[[Category:Clothing by country|Clothing by nationality]]\n[[Category:Costumes]]", "sha1": "nfjs94bx7kxwlupl307lirgrf8368st"}}, {"title": "Cable car (railway)", "ns": "0", "id": "7674", "revision": {"id": "859005983", "parentid": "853472076", "timestamp": "2018-09-11T02:51:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta9) ([[User:Iggy the Swan|Iggy the Swan]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|ground-based mass transit|other cable railway systems|Cable railway|other uses|Cable car}}\nA '''cable car''' ('''cable tram''' elsewhere, apart from North America) is a type of [[cable railway]] used for [[Public transport|mass transit]] where rail cars are hauled by a continuously moving [[Wire rope|cable]] running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are distinct from [[funicular]]s, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable, and [[cable railway]]s, which are similar to funiculars, but where the rail vehicles are attached and detached manually.[[File:11 Cable Car on Powell St crop, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|right|A [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable car]] on the Powell & Hyde line]]\n[[File:Cable car.theora.ogv|thumb|View from Cable Car in San Francisco]]\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|left|Winding drums on the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway, 1840]]\n[[File:Cable Driving Plant, Designed and Constructed by Poole and Hunt, Baltimore, MD.jpg|thumb|Cable Driving Plant, Designed and Constructed by Poole & Hunt, Baltimore, MD.

In America, the first cable car installation in operation probably was the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway]] in [[New York City]], as its first-ever [[elevated railway]] which ran from 1 July 1868 to 1870. The cable technology used in this elevated railway involved collar-equipped cables and claw-equipped cars, proving cumbersome. The line was closed and rebuilt, reopening with [[steam locomotive]]s.\n\nIn 1869 [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] demonstrated a cable car at [[New Orleans]]<ref name=\"St. Charles Streetcar\">{{Cite book |title=St. Charles Streetcar, The: Or, the New Orleans & Carrollton Railroad |author=James Guilbeau |author2= |date =2011 |issue = |volume = |publisher =Pelican Publishing Company |isbn=9781879714021 |pages =48\u201349 }}</ref><ref name=\"The Streetcars of New Orleans\">{{Cite book |title=The Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Louis C.

The building of this line was promoted by [[Andrew Smith Hallidie]] with design work by [[William Eppelsheimer]], and it was first tested in 1873. The success of these grips ensured that this line became the model for other cable car transit systems, and this model is often known as the ''Hallidie Cable Car''.\n\nIn 1881 the [[Dunedin cable tramway system]] opened in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]] and became the first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, [[George Smith Duncan]] further developed the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too sharp to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Melbourne cable tramway system]] operated from 1885 to 1940. It was one of the most extensive in the world with 1200 trams and trailers operating over 15 routes with 103&nbsp;km (64 miles) of track. Sydney also had a couple of cable tram routes.\n\nCable cars rapidly spread to other cities, although the major attraction for most was the ability to displace [[horsecar]] (or [[mule]]-drawn) systems rather than the ability to climb hills. Many people at the time viewed horse-drawn transit as unnecessarily cruel, and the fact that a typical horse could work only four or five hours per day necessitated the maintenance of large [[stables]] of [[draft animals]] that had to be fed, housed, groomed, medicated and rested. Thus, for a period, economics worked in favour of cable cars even in relatively flat cities.\n\nFor example, the [[Chicago City Railway]], also designed by Eppelsheimer, opened in [[Chicago]] in 1882 and went on to become the largest and most profitable [[Cable cars in Chicago|cable car system]]. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of incline, but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities did, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like San Francisco's ''California Cars'', Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.\n\nIn 1883 the [[New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway]] was opened, which had a most curious feature: though it was a cable car system, it used [[steam locomotive]]s to get the cars into and out of the terminals. After 1896 the system was changed to one on which a motor car was added to each train to maneuver at the terminals, while en route, the trains were still propelled by the cable.\n\n[[Image:Cablecarpicjpg.jpg|thumb|right|A San Francisco cable car travels along California Street in the city's Financial District.]]\nOn 25 September 1883, a test of a cable car system was held by [[Liverpool United Tramways and Omnibus Company]] in [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale]], [[Liverpool]]. This would have been the first cable car system in Europe, but the company decided against implementing it. Instead, the distinction went to the 1884 route from [[Archway, London|Archway]] to [[Highgate]], north London, which used a continuous cable and grip system on the 1 in 11 (9%) climb of Highgate Hill. The installation was not reliable and was replaced by electric traction in 1909.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Sheila |title=The Moving Metropolis |publisher=Calmann and King |location=London |year=2001 |page=82 |isbn=1-85669-241-8}}</ref> Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the [[Glasgow Subway|Glasgow District Subway]], the first underground cable car system, in 1896. ([[London]], England's first deep-level tube railway, the [[City & South London Railway]], had earlier also been built for cable haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in 1890.) A few more cable car systems were built in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]], and [[France]]. European cities, having many more curves in their streets, were ultimately less suitable for cable cars than American cities.\n\nThough some new cable car systems were still being built, by 1890 the cheaper to construct and simpler to operate [[electricity|electrically]]-powered [[tram|trolley]] or tram started to become the norm, and eventually started to replace existing cable car systems. For a while hybrid cable/electric systems operated, for example in Chicago where electric cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the loop area, due to the lack of trolley wires there. Eventually, San Francisco became the only street-running manually operated system to survive\u2014Dunedin, the second city with such cars, was also the second-last city to operate them, closing down in 1957.\n\n===Recent Revival===\nIn the last decades of the 20th-century, cable traction in general has seen a limited revival as [[People mover|automatic people movers]], used in resort areas, airports (for example, [[LINK Train|Toronto Airport]]), huge hospital centers and some urban settings.  While many of these systems involve cars permanently attached to the cable, the [[Minimetro]] system from  [[Poma]]/[[Leitner Group]] and the [[Cable Liner]] system from [[DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car]] both have variants that allow the cars to be automatically decoupled from the cable under computer control, and can thus be considered a modern interpretation of the cable car.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:San Francisco Cable Car Power House.jpg|thumb|right|Machinery driving the San Francisco cable car system]]\n[[File:Cablecar tracks in San Francisco, 1970.jpg|thumb|The cable slot lies between the two tracks of the railway, providing an ingress for the grip, 1970.]]\nThe cable is itself powered by a stationary motor or engine situated in a cable house or power house. The speed at which it moves is relatively constant depending on the number of units gripping the cable at any given time.\n\nThe cable car begins moving when a clamping device attached to the car, called a ''[[Cable grip|grip]]'', applies pressure to (\"grips\") the moving cable. Conversely, the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This gripping and releasing action may be manual, as was the case in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated [[people mover]] type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the [[passenger]]s.\n\nIn the case of manual systems, the grip resembles a very large pair of [[pliers]], and considerable strength and skill are required to operate the car. As many early cable car operators discovered the hard way, if the grip is not applied properly, it can damage the cable, or even worse, become entangled in the cable. In the latter case, the cable car may not be able to stop and can wreak havoc along its route until the cable house realizes the mishap and halts the cable.\n\nOne apparent advantage of the cable car is its relative energy efficiency. This is due to the economy of centrally located power stations, and the ability of descending cars to transfer energy to ascending cars.  However, this advantage is totally negated by the relatively large energy consumption required to simply move the cable over and under the numerous guide rollers and around the many [[sheave]]s.  Approximately 95% of the tractive effort in the San Francisco system is expended in simply moving the four cables at 9.5 miles per hour.<ref>Source: San Francisco Municipal Railway</ref>  Electric cars with [[regenerative braking]] do offer the advantages, without the problem of moving a cable.   In the case of steep grades, however, cable traction has the major advantage of not depending on [[rail adhesion|adhesion between wheels and rails]].  There is also the obvious advantage that keeping the car gripped to the cable will also limit the downhill speed to that of the cable.\n\nBecause of the constant and relatively low speed, a cable car's potential to cause harm in an accident can be underestimated. Even with a cable car traveling at only 9 miles per hour, the mass of the cable car and the combined strength and speed of the cable can do quite a lot of damage in a collision.\n\n== Relation to Funiculars == <!-- Do not make this section about funiculars -->\nA cable car is superficially similar to a [[funicular]], but differs from such a system in that its cars are not permanently attached to the cable and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has cars that are permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a single cable, making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.{{when|date=December 2013}}\n\nA few funicular railways operate in street traffic, and because of this operation are often incorrectly described as cable cars. Examples of such operation, and the consequent confusion, are:\n* The [[Great Orme Tramway]] in [[Llandudno]], [[Wales]].\n* Several street funiculars in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].\n\nEven more confusingly, a hybrid cable car/funicular line once existed in the form of the original [[Wellington Cable Car]], in the [[New Zealand]] city of [[Wellington]]. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.\n\n== List of cable car systems ==\n\n=== Cities currently operating cable cars ===\n<!-- Please do not add funiculars here-->\n\n==== Traditional cable car systems ====\nThe best known existing cable car system is the [[San Francisco cable car system]] in the city of [[San Francisco, California]].

A monitor usually comprises the [[display device]], [[electronic circuit|circuitry]], casing, and [[power supply]]. The display device in modern monitors is typically a [[thin film transistor liquid crystal display]] (TFT-LCD) with [[LED-backlit LCD|LED backlighting]] having replaced [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]] (CCFL) backlighting. Older monitors used a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). Monitors are connected to the computer via [[VGA connector|VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI), [[HDMI]], [[DisplayPort]], [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], [[low-voltage differential signaling]] (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.\n\nOriginally, computer monitors were used for [[data processing]] while [[television receiver]]s were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while [[Television set|televisions]] have implemented some computer functionality. The common [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of televisions, and computer monitors, has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9.\n\nModern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets. However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include components such as a [[television tuner]] and [[Computer speakers|speakers]], it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-tv-and-computer-monitor/|title=Difference Between TV and Computer Monitor {{!}} Difference Between|website=www.differencebetween.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nEarly [[electronic computer]]s were fitted with a panel of [[light bulb]]s where the state of each particular bulb would indicate the on/off state of a particular [[register bit]] inside the computer.  This allowed the engineers operating the computer to monitor the internal state of the machine, so this panel of lights came to be known as the 'monitor'.  As early monitors were only capable of displaying a very limited amount of information and were very transient, they were rarely considered for program output. Instead, a line printer was the primary output device, while the monitor was limited to keeping track of the program's operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAs technology developed engineers realized that the output of a CRT display was more flexible than a panel of light bulbs and eventually, by giving control of what was displayed in the program itself, the monitor itself became a powerful output device in its own right.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nComputer monitors were formerly known as '''visual display units''' ('''VDU'''), but this term had mostly fallen out of use by the 1990s.\n\n==Technologies==\n{{Further|Comparison of CRT, LCD, Plasma, and OLED|History of display technology}}\nMultiple technologies have been used for computer monitors. Until the 21st century most used cathode ray tubes but they have largely been superseded by [[LCD monitors]].\n\n===Cathode ray tube===\n{{main|Cathode ray tube}}\nThe first computer monitors used [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs). Prior to the advent of [[home computer]]s in the late 1970s, it was common for a [[video display terminal]] (VDT) using a CRT to be physically integrated with a keyboard and other components of the system in a single large [[chassis]]. The display was [[monochrome]] and far less sharp and detailed than on a modern flat-panel monitor, necessitating the use of relatively large text and severely limiting the amount of information that could be displayed at one time. High-resolution CRT displays were developed for the specialized military, industrial and scientific applications but they were far too costly for general use.\n\nSome of the earliest home computers (such as the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]]) were limited to monochrome CRT displays, but color display capability was already a standard feature of the pioneering [[Apple II]], introduced in 1977, and the specialty of the more graphically sophisticated [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], introduced in 1979. Either computer could be connected to the antenna terminals of an ordinary color TV set or used with a purpose-made CRT color monitor for optimum resolution and color quality. Lagging several years behind, in 1981 IBM introduced the [[Color Graphics Adapter]], which could display four colors with a resolution of 320 x 200 pixels, or it could produce 640 x 200 pixels with two colors. In 1984 IBM introduced the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] which was capable of producing 16 colors and had a resolution of 640 x 350.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/crt/ |title=Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Monitors |publisher=Infodingo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326184456/http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/crt/ |archivedate=2011-03-26 |df= }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 1980s color CRT monitors that could clearly display 1024 x 768 pixels were widely available and increasingly affordable. During the following decade, maximum display resolutions gradually increased and prices continued to fall.

The dynamic range of early LCD panels was very poor, and although text and other motionless graphics were sharper than on a CRT, an LCD characteristic known as pixel lag caused moving graphics to appear noticeably smeared and blurry.\n\n===Liquid crystal display{{anchor|Liquid Crystal}}===\n{{Main|Liquid-crystal display|Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display}}\nThere are multiple technologies that have been used to implement liquid crystal displays (LCD). Throughout the 1990s, the primary use of LCD technology as computer monitors was in laptops where the lower power consumption, lighter weight, and smaller physical size of LCD's justified the higher price versus a CRT. Commonly, the same laptop would be offered with an assortment of display options at increasing price points: (active or passive) monochrome, passive color, or active matrix color (TFT). As volume and manufacturing capability have improved, the monochrome and passive color technologies were dropped from most product lines.\n\n[[TFT-LCD]] is a variant of LCD which is now the dominant technology used for computer monitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/panel_technologies.htm#tn_film |title=TFT Central |publisher=TFT Central |date=2017-09-29 |accessdate=2017-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629182048/http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/panel_technologies.htm#tn_film |archivedate=2017-06-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe first standalone LCDs appeared in the mid-1990s selling for high prices. As prices declined over a period of years they became more popular, and by 1997 were competing with CRT monitors. Among the first desktop LCD computer monitors was the Eizo L66 in the mid-1990s, the Apple Studio Display in 1998, and the Apple Cinema Display in 1999. In 2003, TFT-LCDs outsold CRTs for the first time, becoming the primary technology used for computer monitors.<ref name=\"pctech1\"/> The main advantages of LCDs over CRT displays are that LCD's consume less power, take up much less space, and are considerably lighter. The now common active matrix TFT-LCD technology also has less flickering than CRTs, which reduces eye strain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/lcd/why-choose-an-lcd.aspx |title=Is the LCD monitor right for you? |publisher=Infodingo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227071935/http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/lcd/why-choose-an-lcd.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}</ref> On the other hand, CRT monitors have superior contrast, have a superior response time, are able to use multiple screen resolutions natively, and there is no discernible flicker if the refresh rate<ref name=\"rr\">{{cite web |title=Refresh rate: A note-worthy factor for a PC monitor |url=https://reviewrooster.net/best-pc-monitor-2019/ |website=Review Rooster |date=26 September 2018}}</ref> is set to a sufficiently high value.

Since around the late 2000s, widescreen LCD monitors have become popular, in part due to [[television series]], [[Films|motion pictures]] and [[video game]]s transitioning to high-definition (HD), which makes standard-width monitors unable to display them correctly as they either stretch or crop HD content. These types of monitors may also display it in the proper width, however they usually fill the extra space at the top and bottom of the image with black bars. Other advantages of widescreen monitors over standard-width monitors is that they make work more productive by displaying more of a user's documents and images, and allow displaying toolbars with documents. They also have a larger viewing area, with a typical widescreen monitor having a 16:9 aspect ratio, compared to the 4:3 aspect ratio of a typical standard-width monitor.\n\n===Organic light-emitting diode===\n{{main|Organic light-emitting diode}}\n\n[[Organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) monitors provide higher contrast and better viewing angles than LCDs but they require more power when displaying documents with white or bright backgrounds.\n\n==Measurements of performance==\nThe performance of a monitor is measured by the following parameters:\n*[[Luminance]] is measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m<sup>2</sup> also called a Nit).\n*[[Display aspect ratio|Aspect ratio]] is the ratio of the horizontal length to the vertical length. Monitors usually have the aspect ratio [[4:3]], [[5:4]], [[16:10]] or [[16:9]].\n*[[Viewable image size]] is usually measured diagonally, but the actual widths and heights are more informative since they are not affected by the aspect ratio in the same way. For CRTs, the viewable size is typically {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the tube itself.\n*[[Display resolution]] is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. For a given display size, maximum resolution is limited by dot pitch.\n*[[Dot pitch]] is the distance between sub-pixels of the same color in millimeters. In general, the smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the picture will appear.\n*[[Refresh rate]] is the number of times in a second that a display is illuminated. Maximum refresh rate is limited by response time.\n*[[Response time (technology)|Response time]] is the time a pixel in a monitor takes to go from active (white) to inactive (black) and back to active (white) again, measured in milliseconds. Lower numbers mean faster transitions and therefore fewer visible image artifacts.\n*[[Contrast ratio]] is the ratio of the luminosity of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the monitor is capable of producing.\n*[[Power consumption]] is measured in watts.\n*[[Color difference|Delta-E]]: Color accuracy is measured in delta-E; the lower the delta-E, the more accurate the color representation. A delta-E of below 1 is imperceptible to the human eye. Delta-Es of 2 to 4 are considered good and require a sensitive eye to spot the difference.\n*[[Viewing angle]] is the maximum angle at which images on the monitor can be viewed, without excessive degradation to the image. It is measured in degrees horizontally and vertically.\n\n===Size===\n{{Main|Display size}}\n[[File:Screens png.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The area, height and width of displays with identical diagonal measurements vary dependent on [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]].]]\nOn [[two-dimensional display device]]s such as computer monitors the display size or view able image size is the actual amount of screen space that is available to display a [[picture]], [[video]] or working space, without obstruction from the case or other aspects of the unit's [[design]]. The main measurements for display devices are: width, height, total area and the diagonal.\n\nThe size of a display is usually by monitor manufacturers given by the diagonal, i.e. the distance between two opposite screen corners. This method of measurement is inherited from the method used for the first generation of CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, it was the external diameter of the glass envelope that described their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the rectangular image was smaller than the diameter of the tube's face (due to the thickness of the glass). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3.\n\nWith the introduction of flat panel technology, the diagonal measurement became the actual diagonal of the visible display.  This meant that an eighteen-inch LCD had a larger visible area than an eighteen-inch cathode ray tube.\n\nThe estimation of the monitor size by the distance between opposite corners does not take into account the [[display aspect ratio]], so that for example a 16:9 {{convert|21|in|cm|adj=on}} [[widescreen]] display has less [[area]], than a {{convert|21|in|cm|adj=on}} 4:3 screen. The 4:3 screen has dimensions of {{convert|16.8|\u00d7|12.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} and area {{convert|211|sqin|cm2|abbr=on}}, while the widescreen is {{convert|18.3|\u00d7|10.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|188|sqin|cm2|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Aspect ratio===\n{{Main|Display aspect ratio}}\nUntil about 2003, most computer monitors had a [[4:3]] [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and some had [[5:4]]. Between 2003 and 2006, monitors with [[16:9]] and mostly [[16:10]] (8:5) aspect ratios became commonly available, first in [[laptop]]s and later also in standalone monitors. Reasons for this transition was productive uses for such monitors, i.e. besides [[Field of view in video games|widescreen computer game play]] and movie viewing, are the word processor display of two standard letter pages side by side, as well as CAD displays of large-size drawings and CAD application menus at the same time.<ref>NEMATech Computer Display Standards {{cite web |url=http://www.millertech.com/Technical_Specs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302030131/http://www.millertech.com/Technical_Specs.htm |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315085244/http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |archivedate=2007-03-15 |url=http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |title=Introduction\u2014Monitor Technology Guide |publisher=necdisplay.com}} (currently offline)</ref> In 2008 16:10 became the most common sold aspect ratio for [[LCD monitor]]s and the same year 16:10 was the mainstream standard for [[laptop]]s and [[notebook computers]].<ref name=\"displaysearch1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0A424DE8-28DF6E59/displaysearch/hs.xsl/070108_16by9_PR.asp |title=Product Planners and Marketers Must Act Before 16:9 Panels Replace Mainstream 16:10 and Monitor LCD Panels, New DisplaySearch Topical Report Advises |publisher=DisplaySearch |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2011-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721072242/http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0A424DE8-28DF6E59/displaysearch/hs.xsl/070108_16by9_PR.asp |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 the computer industry started to move over from [[16:10]] to [[16:9]] because 16:9 was chosen to be the standard [[high-definition television]] display size, and because they were cheaper to manufacture.\n\nIn 2011 non-widescreen displays with 4:3 aspect ratios were only being manufactured in small quantities.

By 2015 most major display manufacturers had released 3840x2160 resolution displays.\n\n==Additional features==\n\n===Power saving===\nMost modern monitors will switch to a power-saving mode if no video-input signal is received. This allows modern operating systems to turn off a monitor after a specified period of inactivity. This also extends the monitor's service life. Some monitors will also switch themselves off after a time period on standby.\n\nMost modern laptops provide a method of screen dimming after periods of inactivity or when the battery is in use. This extends battery life and reduces wear.\n\n===Integrated accessories===\nMany monitors have other accessories (or connections for them) integrated. This places [[Computer port (hardware)|standard ports]] within easy reach and eliminates the need for another separate [[USB hub|hub]], [[Webcam|camera]], [[microphone]], or set of [[Computer speaker|speakers]]. These monitors have advanced microprocessors which contain codec information, Windows Interface drivers and other small software which help in proper functioning of these functions.\n\n===Glossy screen===\n{{Main|Glossy display}}\nSome displays, especially newer LCD monitors, replace the traditional anti-glare matte finish with a glossy one. This increases [[color saturation]] and sharpness but reflections from lights and windows are very visible. Anti-reflective coatings are sometimes applied to help reduce reflections, although this only mitigates the effect.\n\n===Curved designs===\nIn about 2009, [[NEC]]/[[Alienware]] together with Ostendo Technologies (based in Carlsbad, CA) were offering a curved (concave) {{convert|43|in|cm|adj=on}} monitor that allows better viewing angles near the edges, covering 75% of peripheral vision. This monitor had 2880x900 resolution, LED backlight and was marketed as suitable both for gaming and office work, while for $6499 it was rather expensive.<ref>[http://www.desktopreview.com/default.asp?newsID=868 R.

NEC/Alienware Curved Display Now Available</ref> While this particular monitor is no longer in production, most PC manufacturers now offer some sort of curved desktop display.\n\n===Directional screen===\nNarrow viewing angle screens are used in some security conscious applications.\n\n===3D===\n{{main|Stereo display}}\n{{See also|Active shutter 3D system|Polarized 3D system|Autostereoscopy}}\nNewer monitors are able to [[Stereoscopy|display a different image for each eye]], often with the help of special glasses, giving the perception of depth.  An autostereoscopic screen can generate 3D images without headgear.\n\n===Touch screen===\n{{Main|Touchscreen}}\nThese monitors use touching of the screen as an input method. Items can be selected or moved with a finger, and finger gestures may be used to convey commands. The screen will need frequent cleaning due to image degradation from fingerprints.\n\n===Tablet screens===\n{{Main|Graphics tablet/screen hybrid}}\nA combination of a monitor with a [[graphics tablet]]. Such devices are typically unresponsive to touch without the use of one or more special tools' pressure. Newer models however are now able to detect touch from any pressure and often have the ability to detect tilt and rotation as well.\n\nTouch and tablet screens are used on LCDs as a substitute for the light pen, which can only work on CRTs.\n\n===Ultrawide screens===\n{{Main|21:9 aspect ratio}}\nMonitors that feature an aspect ratio of 21:9 as opposed to the more common 16:9.\n\n==Mounting==\nComputer monitors are provided with a variety of methods for mounting them depending on the application and environment.\n\n===Desktop===\nA desktop monitor is typically provided with a stand from the manufacturer which lifts the monitor up to a more ergonomic viewing height. The stand may be attached to the monitor using a proprietary method or may use, or be adaptable to, a [[Video Electronics Standards Association]], VESA, standard mount. Using a VESA standard mount allows the monitor to be used with an after-market stand once the original stand is removed. Stands may be fixed or offer a variety of features such as height adjustment, horizontal swivel, and landscape or portrait screen orientation.\n\n===VESA mount===\nThe [[Flat Display Mounting Interface]] (FDMI), also known as VESA Mounting Interface Standard (MIS) or colloquially as a VESA mount, is a family of standards defined by the Video Electronics Standards Association for mounting [[flat panel]] [[computer display|monitor]]s, [[TV]]s, and other displays to stands or wall mounts.<ref name=\"vesa-fdmi\">{{cite web|title=FDMI Overview|url=http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/FDMI-Overview.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927035603/http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/FDMI-Overview.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}</ref> It is implemented on most modern flat-panel monitors and TVs.\n\nFor Computer Monitors, the VESA Mount typically consists of four threaded holes on the rear of the display that will mate with an adapter bracket.\n\n===Rack mount===\n[[19-inch rack|Rack mount]] computer monitors are available in two styles and are intended to be mounted into a 19-inch rack:\n\n[[File:Rackmount-LCD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A fixed {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}}, 4:3 rack mount LCD monitor]]\n;Fixed\nA fixed rack mount monitor is mounted directly to the rack with the LCD visible at all times. The height of the unit is measured in rack units (RU) and 8U or 9U are most common to fit 17-inch or 19-inch LCDs.  The front sides of the unit are provided with flanges to mount to the rack, providing appropriately spaced holes or slots for the rack mounting screws.  A 19-inch diagonal LCD is the largest size that will fit within the rails of a 19-inch rack.  Larger LCDs may be accommodated but are 'mount-on-rack' and extend forward of the rack.  There are smaller display units, typically used in broadcast environments, which fit multiple smaller LCDs side by side into one rack mount.\n\n[[File:Rackmount-KVM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A 1U stowable clamshell {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}}, 4:3 rack mount LCD monitor with keyboard]]\n;Stowable\nA stowable rack mount monitor is [[rack unit|1U, 2U or 3U]] high and is mounted on [[Linear-motion bearing|rack slides]] allowing the display to be folded down and the unit slid into the rack for storage.  The display is visible only when the display is pulled out of the rack and deployed.  These units may include only a display or may be equipped with a keyboard creating a [[Rackmount KVM|KVM]] (Keyboard Video Monitor).  Most common are systems with a single LCD but there are systems providing two or three displays in a single rack mount system.\n\n[[File:Panel-Mount-LCD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A panel mount {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}}, 4:3 rack mount LCD monitor]]\n\n===Panel mount===\nA panel mount computer monitor is intended for mounting into a flat surface with the front of the display unit protruding just slightly.  They may also be mounted to the rear of the panel.  A flange is provided around the LCD, sides, top and bottom, to allow mounting.  This contrasts with a rack mount display where the flanges are only on the sides.  The flanges will be provided with holes for thru-bolts or may have studs welded to the rear surface to secure the unit in the hole in the panel.  Often a gasket is provided to provide a water-tight seal to the panel and the front of the LCD will be sealed to the back of the front panel to prevent water and dirt contamination.\n\n===Open frame===\nAn open frame monitor provides the LCD monitor and enough supporting structure to hold associated electronics and to minimally support the LCD.  Provision will be made for attaching the unit to some external structure for support and protection.  Open frame LCDs are intended to be built into some other piece of equipment.  An arcade video game would be a good example with the display mounted inside the cabinet.  There is usually an open frame display inside all end-use displays with the end-use display simply providing an attractive protective enclosure.  Some rack mount LCD manufacturers will purchase desktop displays, take them apart, and discard the outer plastic parts, keeping the inner open-frame LCD for inclusion into their product.\n\n==Security vulnerabilities==\nAccording to an NSA document leaked to [[Der Spiegel]], the NSA sometimes swaps the monitor cables on targeted computers with a bugged monitor cable in order to allow the NSA to remotely see what is being displayed on the targeted computer monitor.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html Shopping for Spy Gear: Catalog Advertises NSA Toolbox, dec 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100506/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html |date=2015-09-06 }}</ref>\n\n[[Van Eck phreaking]] is the process of remotely displaying the contents of a CRT or LCD by detecting its electromagnetic emissions.

ClearType attempts to improve the appearance of text on certain types of [[computer display]] screens by sacrificing color fidelity for additional intensity variation. This trade-off is asserted to work well on [[LCD]] [[flat panel]] monitors.\n\nClearType was first announced at the November 1998 [[COMDEX]] exhibition. The technology was first introduced in software in January 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1135|title=First ClearType screens posted|publisher=Microsoft Typography|date=2000-01-26|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> as an always-on feature of [[Microsoft Reader]], which was released to the public in August 2000.\n\nClearType was significantly changed with the introduction of [[DirectWrite]] in [[Windows 7]].<ref name=ails>{{cite web|last1=Giannattasio|first1=Tom|title=The Ails Of Typographic Anti-Aliasing|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/|website=Smashing Magazine|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Word 2013]] stopped using ClearType, because \"There is a problem with ClearType: it depends critically on the color of the background pixels.\"<ref name=Word/>\n\n==Background==\nComputer displays where the positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed{{snd}} such as most modern [[flat panel]] displays{{snd}} can show saw-tooth edges when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements, such as text. ClearType uses spatial anti-aliasing at the subpixel level to reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear \"smoother\" and less jagged. ClearType also uses very heavy [[font hinting]] to force the font to fit into the pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticized by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nLike most other types of subpixel rendering, ClearType involves a compromise, sacrificing one aspect of image quality (color or ''[[chrominance]]'' detail) for another (light and dark or ''[[luminance]]'' detail). The compromise can improve text appearance when luminance detail is more important than chrominance.\n\nOnly user and system applications render the application of ClearType. ClearType does not alter other graphic display elements (including text already in [[bitmap]]s). For example, ClearType enhancement renders text on the screen in [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]], but text placed in a bitmapped image in a program such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] is not. In theory, the method (called \"RGB Decimation\" internally) can enhance the anti-aliasing of any digital image.<ref>Betrisey et al., \"Displaced Filtering for Patterned Displays\", Proc. Society for Information Display Symposium, 2000</ref>\n\nClearType is not used when printing text. Most printers already use such small pixels that aliasing is rarely a problem, and they don't have the addressable fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.\n\nClearType was invented in the Microsoft e-Books team by Bert Keely and Greg Hitchcock.  It was then analyzed by researchers in the company, and signal processing expert [[John Platt (Principal Researcher)|John Platt]] designed an improved version of the algorithm.<ref>Platt, J.C., \"[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68972/optfilt.pdf Optimal Filtering for Patterned Displays]\", IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 7(7), 2000, pp. 179-180</ref>  [[Dick Brass]], a Vice President at Microsoft from 1997 to 2004, complained that the company was slow in moving ClearType to market in the portable computing field.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagewanted=1&ref=opinion Microsoft\u2019s Creative Destruction]</ref>\n\n==How ClearType works==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=subpixel rendering|date=August 2014}}\n\nNormally, the software in a computer treats the computer\u2019s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible [[pixel]]s, each of which has an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three [[primary color]]s: red, green, and blue. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixel as a group of three adjacent, independent ''[[subpixel]]s,'' each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a flat-panel display is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows:\n\n[[Image:27 subpixels.svg|center|Subpixels|thumb]]\n\nIn the illustration above, there are nine pixels but 27 subpixels.\n\nIf the computer controlling the display knows the exact position and color of all the subpixels on the screen, it can take advantage of this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only one or two of the subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).\n\n[[Image:Antialias-vrs-Cromapixel.svg|center|frame|1) A diagonal line on a 1-bit display. 2) Grayscale anti-aliasing. 3) Identical to 1, but on a color monitor. 4) Rendered with direct control of each color subpixel. 5) Smaller version of 1-4. 6) 1 pixel lines without and with anti-aliasing.]]\n\nClearType uses this method to improve the smoothness of text. When the elements of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of that character. Text rendered with ClearType looks \u201csmoother\u201d than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.\n\nThe following picture shows a 4\u00d7 enlargement of the word ''Wikipedia'' rendered using ClearType.

The study notes that maximum benefit may be seen when the information worker is spending large proportions of their time reading text (which is not necessarily the case for the majority of computer users today).  Additionally, over one third of the study participants experienced some disadvantage when using ClearType.  Whether ClearType, or other rendering, should be used is very subjective and it must be the choice of the individual, with the report recommending \"to allow users to disable [ClearType] if they find it produces effects other than improved performance\".<ref>Dillon, A., Kleinman, L., Choi, G.

In a 2004 study, for instance, Lee Gugerty, a psychology professor at Clemson University, in South Carolina, measured a 17 percent improvement in word recognition accuracy with ClearType. Gugerty\u2019s group also showed, in a sentence comprehension study, that ClearType boosted reading speed by 5 percent and comprehension by 2 percent. Similarly, in a study published in 2007, psychologist Andrew Dillon at the University of Texas at Austin found that when subjects were asked to scan a spreadsheet and pick out certain information, they did those tasks 7 percent faster with ClearType.\"<ref>Kevin Larson (May 2007) \"[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-technology-of-text The Technology of Text]\", ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]''</ref>\n\n==Display requirements==\nClearType and allied technologies require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, the positions of the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected. This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which the positions of the pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue, arranged in vertical bands. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.\n\nClearType does not work properly with flat-panel displays that are operated at resolutions other than their \u201cnative\u201d resolutions, since only the native resolution corresponds exactly to the actual positions of pixels on the screen of the display.\n\nIf a display does not have the type of fixed pixels that ClearType expects, text rendered with ClearType enabled actually looks worse than type rendered without it. Some flat panels have unusual pixel arrangements, with the colors in a different order, or with the subpixels positioned differently (in three horizontal bands, or in other ways). ClearType needs to be manually tuned for use with such displays (see below).\n\nClearType will not work as intended on displays that have no fixed pixel positions, such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, however it will still have some antialiasing effect and may be preferable to some users as compared to non-anti-aliased type.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|title=ClearType FAQ|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx|website=Microsoft|accessdate=19 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624222557/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx |archivedate=24 June 2015|date=19 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Sensitivity to display orientation==\nBecause ClearType utilizes the physical layout of the red, green and blue [[pigments]] of the LCD screen, it is sensitive to the orientation of the display.\n\nClearType in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows XP]] currently supports the [[RGB]] and [[BGR (subpixels)|BGR]] sub pixel structures. Rotated displays, in which the subpixels are arranged vertically rather than horizontally, are ''not'' currently supported. Using ClearType on these display configurations will actually reduce the display quality. The best option for users of Windows XP having rotated LCD displays ([[Microsoft Tablet PC|Tablet PCs]] or swivel-stand LCD displays) is using regular anti-aliasing, or switching off font-smoothing altogether.\n\nThe software developer documentation for [[Windows CE]] states that ClearType for rotated screens is supported on that platform.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms901093.aspx Working with ClearType Fonts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical sub pixel structures are not supported in Windows XP.<ref>[http://www.brandonfurtwangler.com/?p=54 Tablets and cleartype, and a requested feature of Avalon at Brandon Furtwangler blog]</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n* [[Windows XP]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows Vista]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 7]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 8]]: Only used in Windows 8 Desktop and all desktop apps<ref name=\"something\">[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20120303/cleartype-takes-a-back-seat-for-windows-8-metro/ ClearType takes a back seat for Windows 8 Metro]</ref>\n* [[Internet Explorer 7]] and later (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Office 2007]] and later (on by default)\n* [[Windows Live Messenger]] (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Reader]]\n\nClearType is also an integrated component of the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] text-rendering engine.\n\n===ClearType in GDI===\nClearType can be globally enabled or disabled for [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] applications. A control panel applet is available to let the users tune the GDI ClearType settings. The GDI implementation of ClearType does not support sub-pixel positioning.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Overview]</ref>\n\n===ClearType tuning===\nSome versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], as supplied, allow ClearType to be turned on or off, with no adjustment; other versions allow tuning of the ClearType parameters. A Microsoft ClearType tuner utility is available for free download for Windows versions lacking this facility.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx | title = Microsoft's ClearType Tuner PowerToy | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> If ClearType is disabled in the operating system, applications with their own ClearType controls can still support it. [[Microsoft Reader]] (for [[e-book]]s) has its own ClearType tuner.\n\n===ClearType in WPF===\nAll text in [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType. There are separate ClearType registry settings for GDI and WPF applications, but by default the WPF entries are absent, and the GDI values are used in their absence. WPF registry entries can be tuned using the instructions<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2006/10/18/tips-for-improving-your-wpf-text-rendering-experience.aspx Tips for improving your WPF text rendering experience]</ref> from the MSDN WPF Text Blog.\n\nClearType in WPF supports sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing and [[hardware acceleration]]. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx MSDN Library : .NET Development : WPF : ClearType Overview]</ref> The extent to which this is supported is dependent on the [[video card]]. [[DirectX]] 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), [[alpha blending]] (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2&nbsp;MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics{{snd}} including video{{snd}} can also be done with no computation effort on the part of the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card.  Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5&nbsp;MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.\n\n===ClearType in DirectWrite===\n{{Expand section|changes|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe font rendering engine in [[DirectWrite]] supports an improved version of ClearType, as demonstrated at [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC]] 2008.<ref name=DirectWrite>{{cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC18|title=PC18: Introducing Direct2D and DirectWrite|author=Kam VedBrat, Leonardo Blanco|publisher=Microsoft|date=2008-10-28}}</ref> The improved version is sometimes called ''Natural ClearType''.<ref>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/02/13/advances-in-typography-and-text-rendering-in-windows-7.aspx</ref> The improvements have been confirmed by independent sources, such as [[Firefox]] developers;<ref>http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/font-rendering-gdi-versus-directwrite</ref> they were particularly noticeable for OpenType fonts in [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF).<ref>https://blog.mozilla.org/nattokirai/2009/10/22/better-postscript-cff-font-rendering-with-directwrite/</ref><ref>http://blog.typekit.com/2010/11/12/microsoft-directwrite-is-coming/</ref>\n\nDespite these improvements, [[Word 2013]] stopped using ClearType. The reasons invoked are, in the words of Murray Sargent: \"There is a problem with ClearType: it depends critically on the color of the background pixels. This isn\u2019t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn\u2019t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in future scenarios, screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale anti-aliasing should suffice.\"<ref name=Word>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/murrays/archive/2014/05/31/crisp-text-display.aspx</ref>\n\nFor the same reasons related to animation performance, the color-aware version of ClearType was abandoned in Metro and the Windows 8 (and 10) start menus.<ref>[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150129-00/?p=44803 Color-aware ClearType requires access to fixed background pixels, which is a problem if you don\u2019t know what the background pixels are, or if they aren\u2019t fixed]</ref><ref name=\"something\"/>\n\n==Patents==\nClearType is a [[registered trademark]] and Microsoft claims protection under the following U.S. [[patent]]s:<ref name=\"msip\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/iplicensing/productDetail.aspx?productTitle=ClearType |title=Microsoft Intellectual Property and Licensing: ClearType |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113030909/http://www.microsoft.com/iplicensing/productDetail.aspx?productTitle=ClearType |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"cleartype_expl\">{{cite web|url=http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html|date=2007-06-01|accessdate=2009-04-09|title=ClearType Patents, FreeType and the Unix Desktop: an explanation|author=David Turner}}</ref>\n\n* Subpixel rendering:\n** {{US patent|6188385}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for displaying images such as text''\n** {{US patent|6219025}} \u2013 ''Mapping image data samples to pixel sub-components on a striped display device''\n** {{US patent|6239783}} \u2013 ''Weighted mapping of image data samples to pixel sub-components on a display device''\n** {{US patent|6307566}} \u2013 ''Methods and apparatus for performing image rendering and rasterization operations''\n* Complex color filtering:\n** {{US patent|6225973}} \u2013 ''Mapping samples of foreground/background color image data to pixel sub-components''\n** {{US patent|6243070}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for detecting and reducing color artifacts in images''\n** {{US patent|6393145}} \u2013 ''Methods apparatus and data structures for enhancing the resolution of images to be rendered on patterned display devices''\n* Subpixel font hinting and layout:\n** {{US patent|6421054}} \u2013 ''Methods and apparatus for performing grid fitting and hinting operations''\n** {{US patent|6282327}} \u2013 ''Maintaining advance widths of existing characters that have been resolution enhanced''\n* ClearType tuning:\n** {{US patent|6624828}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for improving the quality of displayed images through the use of user reference information''\n\n==Other uses of the ClearType brand ==\nThe ClearType name was also used to refer to the screens of [[Microsoft Surface]] tablets.

These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech (\"And God said, Let there be light,\" etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 \"nations\" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical chronology]], which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\n\n===Modern religious affiliations===\nMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] supported by [[Liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]].

Soon after its publication, a movement was underway to have the subject taught in United States' public schools.\n\n===Court determinations===\nThe various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution were overturned in 1968 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' such laws violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. This ruling inspired a new creationist movement to promote laws requiring that schools give balanced treatment to creation science when evolution is taught. The 1981 Arkansas Act 590 was one such law that carefully detailed the principles of creation science that were to receive equal time in public schools alongside evolutionary principles.<ref>{{cite journal|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=Summer 1982|title=Act 590 of 1981: General Acts, 73rd General Assembly, State of Arkansas|journal=[[Science, Technology, & Human Values]]|location=New York|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|volume=7|issue=40|pages=11\u201313|issn=0162-2439|jstor=688783}}<!--|accessdate=2014-09-18--></ref> The act defined creation science as follows:\n\n\"'Creation-science' means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\n:#Sudden creation of the universe, and, in particular, life, from nothing;\n:#The insufficiency of [[mutation]] and natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds from a single organism;\n:#Changes only with fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals;\n:#Separate ancestry for man and [[ape]]s;\n:#Explanation of the earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of worldwide flood; and\n:#A relatively recent inception of the earth and living kinds.\"\n\nThis legislation was examined in ''McLean v. Arkansas'', and the ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that creation-science as defined in the act \"is simply not science\". The judgement defined the following as essential characteristics of science:\n:#It is guided by natural law;\n:#It has to be explanatory by reference to nature law;\n:#It is testable against the empirical world;\n:#Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n:#It is falsifiable.\n\nThe court ruled that creation science failed to meet these essential characteristics and identified specific reasons. After examining the key concepts from creation science, the court found:\n:#Sudden creation \"from nothing\" calls upon a supernatural intervention, not natural law, and is neither testable nor falsifiable\n:#Objections in creation science that mutation and natural selection are insufficient to explain common origins was an incomplete negative generalization\n:#'Kinds' are not scientific classifications, and creation science's claims of an outer limit to the evolutionary change possible of species are not explained scientifically or by natural law\n:#Separate ancestry of man and apes is an assertion rather than scientific explanation, and did not derive from any scientific fact or theory\n:#Catastrophism, including its identification of the worldwide flood, failed as a science\n:#\"Relatively recent inception\" was the product of religious readings and had no scientific meaning, and was neither the product of, nor explainable by, natural law; nor is it tentative\n\nThe court further noted that no recognized [[scientific journal]] had published any article espousing the creation science theory as described in the Arkansas law, and stated that the testimony presented by defense attributing the absence to censorship was not credible.\n\nIn its ruling, the court wrote that for any theory to qualify as scientific, the theory must be tentative, and open to revision or abandonment as new facts come to light. It wrote that any methodology which begins with an immutable conclusion which cannot be revised or rejected, regardless of the evidence, is not a scientific theory. The court found that creation science does not culminate in conclusions formed from scientific inquiry, but instead begins with the conclusion, one taken from a literal wording of the Book of Genesis, and seeks only scientific evidence to support it.\n\nThe law in Arkansas adopted the same two-model approach as that put forward by the [[Institute for Creation Research]], one allowing only two possible explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Scientific evidence that failed to support the theory of evolution was posed as necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism, but in its judgment the court ruled this approach to be no more than a \"[[False dilemma|contrived dualism]] which has not scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose.\"<ref name=\"McLean_vs_Arkansas\">{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html |title=McLean v.

The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the [[anti-evolutionist]] design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to \"creation\" or \"creator,\" and replace them instead with references to \"design\" or \"designer.\"<ref name=\"numbers\">{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemic]]s and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the [[intelligent designer]] as God in their public arguments, intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the First Amendment's prohibition against religious infringement.<ref name=\"Johnson-Touchstone\">{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E.

While creationist movements also exist in [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], these movements do not use the phrase ''creation science'' to describe their beliefs.\n\n==Issues==\nCreation science has its roots in the work of young Earth creationist George McCready Price disputing modern science's account of [[natural history]], focusing particularly on geology and its concept of uniformitarianism, and his efforts instead to furnish an alternative empirical explanation of observable phenomena which was compatible with strict Biblical literalism.<ref>{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&pg=PA107 107\u2013111]}}</ref> Price's work was later discovered by civil engineer Henry M.

Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from [[faith]] in a religious text rather than by the application of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"McLean_vs_Arkansas\" /> The United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) has stated unequivocally, \"Evolution pervades all biological phenomena.

In some areas of science such as [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]] or medicine, creation science proponents do not challenge the application of naturalistic or uniformitarian assumptions.

Evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes as well as correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as [[dendrochronology]], ice core dating, and historical records. Although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in [[quantum mechanics]], wherein any deviation in the rate would require a change in the fundamental constants. According to these principles, a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly, and a comparison between each of the elements' resulting unique chronological timescales would then give inconsistent time estimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF210.html |title=CF210: Constancy of Radioactive Decay Rates |date=June 4, 2003 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn refutation of young Earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C.

The artificially-produced isotope, [[Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-7]] has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.\n# ... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus. ... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees. ...\n#The last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by [[atomic clock]]s in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity.

Gentry]] proposed that radiohaloes in certain granites represented evidence for the Earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually. This idea has been criticized by physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks Gentry studied were not primordial and that the radionuclides in question need not have been in the rocks initially.\n\nThomas A. Baillieul, a geologist and retired senior environmental scientist with the [[United States Department of Energy]], disputed Gentry's claims in an article entitled, \"'Polonium Haloes' Refuted: A Review of 'Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective' by Robert V.

Additionally, he noted that Gentry relied on research from the beginning of the 20th century, long before radioisotopes were thoroughly understood; that his assumption that a [[polonium]] isotope caused the rings was speculative; and that Gentry falsely argued that the half-life of radioactive elements varies with time. Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/creation-halos-stand-unrefuted.htm |title=It Stands Unrefuted |last=Gentry |first=Bob |authorlink=Robert V.

The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the Universe require millions or billions of years for [[speed of light|light to travel]] to Earth (the \"[[Creationist cosmologies#The \"starlight problem\"|starlight problem]]\").

R. R. Tolkien]] for the [[constructed language]]s he devised and used in his works. ''Cirth'' is written with a capital letter when referring to the writing system; the runes themselves can be called ''cirth''.\n\nIn the fictional history of [[Middle-earth]], the original '''''Certhas Daeron''''' was created by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Daeron]], and was later expanded into what was known as the '''''Angerthas Daeron'''''. Although the Cirth were later largely replaced by the [[Tengwar]], they were adopted by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] to write down their [[Khuzdul]] language ('''''Angerthas Moria''''' and '''''Angerthas Erebor''''') because their straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar. Cirth was also adapted, in its oldest and simplest form, by various peoples including [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] and even [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]].\n\n==Earliest Cirth==\nDuring the Chaining of [[Melkor]], the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] began developing an [[alphabet]] for their language. Its letters were entirely made for carving on wood, stone or metal, hence their angular forms and straight lines. These letters were named ''cirth'' (sing. ''certh''). The corresponding [[Quenya]] words are ''certar'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8k\u025brt\u0251r]}}) and ''certa'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8k\u025brt\u0251]}}).<ref name=\"Tolkien 1955\">{{cite book |title=[[The Lord of the Rings]], Volume III - [[The Return of the King]], Appendix E|first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien |authorlink=J.R.R.

The attachment of the branch was, if on one side only, usually made on the right side. The reverse was not infrequent, but had no phonetic significance.<br>Two basic principles were followed:\n* adding a stroke to a branch added [[Voiced consonant|voice]];\n* placing the branch on both sides of the stem added [[Nasal stop|voice and nasality]].\nThe original display of Cirth should have been this:<ref name=\"Tolkien 1955\"/>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

We can infer that this was the certh for \"m\" judging by both its 'labial' shape, and the symmetrical shape used for nasals.\n# This certh will later have the value \"m\". Its original value can't be guessed, but judging from the 'labial' shape, it could be \"w\".\n# The sound of these cirth was interchangeable.\n# This certh will later have the value \"ss\". It must have had another unknown value before.\n\nThe known ancient cirth don't cover all the sounds of Sindarin, since we are missing \"rh\", \"lh\", \"mh\", \"y\", \"\u0153\". Perhaps they were used for the Old Sindarin tongue, and many of the above-mentioned sounds indeed didn't exist in that language. However still frequent sounds \"w\" and \"a\" are missing. This indicates that some ancient, unknown cirth could have existed, but didn't make it to the later systems; a fuller table therefore can't be reconstructed.<br>As for the vowel usage, perhaps the certh for \"u\" possibly was used for \"w\" (like in early Latin orthography). The certh for \"a\" can't be guessed, so maybe this sound was meant (like in some Tengwar Modes for Quenya). More possibly it was one of some other cirth that did not survive.<br>Long vowels were evidently indicated by doubling.<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Cirth#Structure \"Structure\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>\n\n==Certhas Daeron==\nThe [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Daeron]], [[minstrel]] of king [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] reorganised the cirth and added new ones, being somehow inspired by [[F\u00ebanor]]'s [[Tengwar]] (therefore this mustn't have occurred before the return of the [[Noldor]]) and made the extension of the cirth known as '''''Certhas Daeron''''' (where \"Certhas\" means \"runic alphabet\"<ref>[http://www.tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Certhas \"Certhas\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>), used for inscribing names in [[Menegroth]]. The [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] working for Thingol liked them and adopted them, making them known also in the East.<br>Unlike the previous system, the reversal of the certh had a phonemic significance: reversed cirth were softer versions of their originals. This also gives us another information: perhaps [[Lenition|lenited]] consonants must have started to occur in Sindarin around that time.<br>We know that at one time a sign for the sound \"mh\" was needed and the most appropriate solution was to revert the certh for \"m\" to indicate its softening, but it could not be reverted ([[Image:Certh 5.svg|15px]]); therefore \"m\" was given to the reversible [[Image:Certh 6.svg|15px]] (which until then had a value unknown to us), \"mh\" to [[Image:Certh 7.svg|15px]], and the certh [[Image:Certh 5.svg|15px]] got the value of \"hw\".<ref name=\"Tolkien 1955\"/><ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Certhas_Daeron \"Certhas Daeron\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Later the [[Noldor]] in [[Eregion]] adopted the Cirth, added several more runes to the system and created the '''''Angerthas Daeron''''' (where \"Angerthas\" means \"long rune-rows\"<ref>[http://www.tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Angerthas \"Angerthas\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>) sometimes also referred to as '''''Angerthas Eregion'''''. These additional letters were used to represent sounds not found in Sindarin, but present in the tongues of other peoples. The Angerthas Daeron was used primarily for carved inscriptions. For most other forms of written communication the Tengwar were used.<br>Here the Cirth are grouped according to their phonetic features:\n* the cirth #1\u20137 are [[labial consonant]]s;\n* the cirth #8\u201312 are [[dental consonant]]s;\n* the cirth #13\u201317 are [[palatal consonant]]s and are inventions of the Noldor;\n* the cirth #18\u201322;33 are [[velar consonant]]s;\n* the cirth #23\u201328 are [[Labialization|labialized consonant]]s, introduced by the Noldor;\n* the cirth #29\u201332 are [[liquid consonant]]s;\n* the cirth #34\u201336 are [[sibilant|hissing sibilants]];\n* the cirth #39;42\u201352 are [[vowel]]s and [[semi-vowel]]s.\n\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!'''''Certh'''''||'''No.'''||'''Translit.'''||'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n!'''''Certh'''''||'''No.'''||'''Translit.'''||'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n!'''''Certh'''''||'''No.'''||'''Translit.'''||'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n!'''''Certh'''''||'''No.'''||'''Translit.'''||'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 1.svg|20px]]||1||p||{{IPA|/p/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 16.svg|20px]]||16||zh||{{IPA|/\u0292/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 31.svg|20px]]||31||l||{{IPA|/l/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 46.svg|20px]]||46||e||{{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 2.svg|20px]]||2||b||{{IPA|/b/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 17.svg|20px]]||17||nj||{{IPA|/nd\u0292/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 32.svg|20px]]||32||lh||{{IPA|/\u026c/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 47.svg|20px]]||47||\u00ea||{{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 3.svg|20px]]||3||f||{{IPA|/f/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 18.svg|20px]]||18||k||{{IPA|/k/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 33.svg|20px]]||33||ng||{{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 48.svg|20px]]||48||a||{{IPA|/\u0251/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 4.svg|20px]]||4||v||{{IPA|/v/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 19.svg|20px]]||19||g||{{IPA|/\u0261/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 34.svg|20px]]||34||rowspan=\"2\"|s||rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|/s/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 49.svg|20px]]||49||\u00e2||{{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 5.svg|20px]]||5||hw||{{IPA|/\u028d/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 20.svg|20px]]||20||kh||{{IPA|/x/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 35.svg|20px]]||35\n|[[Image:Certh 50.svg|20px]]||50||o||{{IPA|/\u0254/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 6.svg|20px]]||6||m||{{IPA|/m/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 21.svg|20px]]||21||gh||{{IPA|/\u0263/}} \n|[[Image:Certh 36.svg|20px]]||36||ss-z<sup>2</sup>||{{IPA|/ss/-/z/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 51.svg|20px]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[Image:Certh 51a.svg|20px]]||51||\u00f4||{{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 7.svg|20px]]||7||mh||{{IPA|/\u1e7d/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 22.svg|20px]]||22||\u014b||{{IPA|/\u014b/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|[[Image:Certh 52.svg|20px]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[Image:Certh 52a.svg|20px]]||52||\u00f6||{{IPA|/\u0153/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 8.svg|20px]]||8||t||{{IPA|/t/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 23.svg|20px]]||23||kw||{{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 38.svg|20px]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[Image:Certh 38a.svg|20px]]||38||nd||{{IPA|/nd/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 9.svg|20px]]||9||d||{{IPA|/d/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 24.svg|20px]]||24||gw||{{IPA|/\u0261\u02b7/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 39.svg|20px]]||39||i,&nbsp;y||{{IPA|/i/,&nbsp;/j/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 54.svg|20px]]||54||h<sup>3</sup>||{{IPA|/h/}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 10.svg|20px]]||10||th||{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 25.svg|20px]]||25||khw||{{IPA|/x\u02b7/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 11.svg|20px]]||11||dh||{{IPA|/\u00f0/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 26.svg|20px]]||26||ghw||{{IPA|/\u0263\u02b7/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 12.svg|20px]]||12||n||{{IPA|/n/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 27.svg|20px]]||27||ngw||{{IPA|/\u014b\u0261\u02b7/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 42.svg|20px]]||42||u||{{IPA|/u/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 13.svg|20px]]||13||ch<sup>1</sup>||{{IPA|/t\u0283/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 28.svg|20px]]||28||nw||{{IPA|/\u014b\u02b7/}}\u2192{{IPA|/n\u02b7/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 43.svg|20px]]||43||\u00fb||{{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 14.svg|20px]]||14||j||{{IPA|/d\u0292/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 29.svg|20px]]||29||r||{{IPA|/r/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 44.svg|20px]]||44||w||{{IPA|/w/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 15.svg|20px]]||15||sh||{{IPA|/\u0283/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 30.svg|20px]]||30||rh||{{IPA|/r\u0325/}}\n|[[Image:Certh 45.svg|20px]]&nbsp;or&nbsp;[[Image:Certh 45a.svg|20px]]||45||\u00fc||{{IPA|/y/}}\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Notes on Angerthas Daeron===\n\n\n# The certh [[Image:Certh 13.svg|16px]] (previously used for {{IPA|/h/}}) was chosen for \"ch\" {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, as its shape looked intermediate between the cirth [[Image:Certh 8.svg|16px]] and [[Image:Certh 18.svg|16px]], and it occurred phonologically between sounds {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}. This should not be confused with Sindarin {{angbr|ch}} pronounced {{IPA|/x/}} and here transliterated with \"kh\".\n# Tolkien gives the value {{IPA|/z/}} to this certh (maybe in alien systems), but notes it was {{IPA|/ss/}} when used in Quenya and Sindarin.\n# This new certh was made for the value of {{IPA|/h/}}, similar in shape to the former [[Image:Certh 13.svg|16px]] (and to the tengwa ''hyarmen'').\n\nFor the transliteration of this alphabet, meant to be used for more than one language (for Quenya and Sindarin, at least) and needing a bigger set of sounds, Tolkien thought up to a kind of ''general Middle-earth languages phonetic transcription'', here used.\n\n==Angerthas Moria==\nDwarves first came to know the runes of the Noldor during the beginning of the [[Second Age]]. They modified them to suit the specific needs of their language, Khuzdul. The Dwarves spread their revised alphabet to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], where it came to be known as '''''Angerthas Moria'''''. The Dwarves developed both carved and pen-written forms of the runes. Travelling for trading, they spread their alphabet throughout Middle-earth: as a result, variations of Angerthas Moria were employed by other races for their languages.\n\nMany cirth here stand for sounds not occurring in Khuzdul (at least in published words of Khuzdul: of course, our corpus is very limited to judge the necessity or not, of these sounds). Here they are marked with a black star (<sup>\u2605</sup>).\n\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-

a word with an initial vowel. Thus, in need of a reversible cirth to represent these sounds, they switched [[Image:Certh 54.svg|16px]] and [[Image:Certh 34.svg|16px]], giving the first the value {{IPA|/s/}} and using the second for {{IPA|/h/}} and its reversed counterpart [[Image:Certh 35.svg|16px]] for {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.\n# These cirth where a halved form of [[Image:Certh 46.svg|16px]], used for vowels like those in the word \"b''u''tt''e''r\". [[Image:Certh 55.svg|16px]] represented a schwa sound {{IPA|/\u0259/}} in unstressed syllables, while [[Image:Certh 56.svg|16px]] represented {{IPA|/\u028c/}}, a sound similar to the schwa, only in stressed syllables. When weak they were reduced to a stroke without a stem ([[Image:Certh 55a.svg|16px]], [[Image:Certh 56a.svg|16px]]).\n# This sign is to denote [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] in voiceless stops, occurring frequently in Khuzdul.\n\n* For unknown reasons, the Dwarves also dropped the cirth [[Image:Certh 14.svg|16px]] {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, [[Image:Certh 16.svg|16px]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} and for those sounds they substituted [[Image:Certh 29.svg|16px]] and [[Image:Certh 30.svg|16px]] which the Elves used for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/r\u0325/}}.\n* Subsequently, the Dwarves used [[Image:Certh 12.svg|16px]] for {{IPA|/\u0280/, /\u0281/}} which had the value of {{IPA|/n/}} by the Elves; then for the sound of {{IPA|/n/}}, they chose the certh [[Image:Certh 22.svg|16px]] which the Elves used for the sound {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, useless in Khuzdul.\n* They also invented the new certh [[Image:Certh 53.svg|16px]], used as an alternative, simplified (and, maybe, weaker) form of [[Image:Certh 22.svg|16px]]. Inspired by the visual relation of those two letters, they gave [[Image:Certh 17.svg|16px]] the value of {{IPA|/z/}} to relate better with [[Image:Certh 54.svg|16px]] that had, by then, the value {{IPA|/s/}}.<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Angerthas_Moria \"Angerthas Moria\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>\n\n==Angerthas Erebor==\nAccording to [[Tolkien's legendarium]], after the [[Second Age]], the Cirth were obsoleted by the [[Tengwar]] among the western races and remained in use only by Dwarves and Men. The Dwarves developed even pen-written cursive forms, since they used them exclusively in any form of writing communication, even in paper. At the beginning of the [[Third Age]], the Dwarves were driven out of Moria. Some migrated to the [[Ered Mithrin|Grey Mountains]], some to the [[Iron Hills]] and [[Thr\u00e1in I]] came to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. There he founded his Dwarf-kingdom. There the ''Angerthas Moria'' was modified further and some new cirth were added, but some reverted to their Elvish usage, thus creating the '''''Angerthas Erebor''''' variation. This mode was used in [[Westron]] by Dwarves.<ref name=\"Angerthas Erebor\">[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Angerthas_Erebor \"Angerthas Erebor\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>\n\nMany cirth here stand for sounds not occurring in Khuzdul (at least in published words of Khuzdul: of course, our corpus is very limited to judge the necessity or not, of these sounds).

(''not'' [[Futhorc]] runes, which he did use in [[The Hobbit]]) at least twice in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'':\n* in the upper inscription of the title page, where it reads \"''[dh]\u0259&#183;&#8203;lord&#183;&#8203;ov&#183;&#8203;[dh]\u0259&#183;&#8203;ri\u014bs&#183;&#8203;translat\u1d4ad&#183;&#8203;from&#183;&#8203;[dh]\u0259&#183;&#8203;[[Red Book of

In fact, he invented a great number of runic alphabets, of which only a few others have been published. Many of them were included in the \"Appendix on Runes\" in [[The History of Middle-Earth]], vol. VII, [[The Treason of Isengard]], edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].\n\n===Runes from ''The Hobbit''===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Hobbit cover.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Runes around the edges of the cover of ''The Hobbit'' are a transliteration of English, giving information on the book.]] -->\n\nAccording to Tolkien, the earliest Cirth became known to many peoples of Middle-earth like Men, Dwarves or Orcs. The people of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]] and the [[Rohirrim]] maintained a simple form of these characters \u2014 hence the \"branching runes\" that appear on the stone floor of the [[Meduseld]] in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]].\n\nIt is speculated that the runes used in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' are indeed the form of Cirth used by the Men of Dale, although Tolkien himself wrote that the letters used for [[Thror]]'s Map are a form of [[Fu\u00feorc|our ancient runes]] used to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] actual Dwarf-runes.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Hobbit]]|first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien |authorlink=J.R.R. Tolkien |publisher=London: George Allen & Unwin. |year=1937}}</ref>\n\nThese runes \u2013 used only to write in [[English language|English]] \u2013 are indeed nearly identical to those of Fu\u00feorc but their sound may change according to their position, just as the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters do. And, in fact, Tolkien's writing mode for these runes is mainly orthographic.<br>\nIt has one rune for each letter, regardless of pronunciation (for example the rune [[Image:Certh 13.svg|16px]] can sound {{IPAc-en|k}} in the word {{angbr|''c''at}} or {{IPAc-en|s}} in the word {{angbr|''c''ellar}} or even {{IPAc-en|\u0283}} in the word {{angbr|deli''c''ious}} and {{IPAc-en|t\u0283}} in the digraph [[Image:Certh 13.svg|16px]][[Image:Certh 47.svg|16px]]).<br>\nA few sounds are instead written with the same rune regardless of the letter (e.g. the sound {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}} is always written with the rune [[Image:Certh 24.svg|16px]] either if in English it is written {{angbr|o}} as in {{angbr|n''o''rth}}, {{angbr|a}} as in {{angbr|f''a''ll}}, or {{angbr|oo}} as in {{angbr|d''oo''r}}). The letters that are subject to this phonemic spelling are {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|o}}.<br>\nIn addition, there are also some runes which stand for particular English digraphs and diphthongs.\n\nHere the runes used in ''The Hobbit'' are represented along with their English transliteration and [[Fu\u00feorc]] equivalent:\n\n<center>\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!'''''Rune'''''||'''Translit.'''||'''Fu\u00feorc'''\n!'''''Rune'''''||'''Translit.'''||'''Fu\u00feorc'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc A.svg|20px]]||rowspan=2|a||{{script|Runr|\u16aa}}\n|[[Image:Certh 28.svg|20px]]||p||{{script|Runr|\u16c8}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 9.svg|20px]]||{{script|Runr|\u16ab}}\n|[[Image:Certh 2.svg|20px]]||r||{{script|Runr|\u16b1}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 6.svg|20px]]||b||{{script|Runr|\u16d2}}\n|[[Image:Certh 40.svg|20px]]||s||{{script|Runr|\u16cb}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 13.svg|20px]]||c||{{script|Runr|\u16b3}}\n|[[Image:Certh 12.svg|20px]]||t||{{script|Runr|\u16cf}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 38.svg|20px]]||d||{{script|Runr|\u16de}}\n|[[Image:Certh 48.svg|20px]]||u, v||{{script|Runr|\u16a2}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc E.svg|20px]]||e||{{script|Runr|\u16d6}}\n|[[Image:Certh 1.svg|20px]]||w||{{script|Runr|\u16b9}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc F.svg|20px]]||f||{{script|Runr|\u16a0}}\n|[[Image:Certh 22.svg|20px]]||x||{{script|Runr|\u16c9}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 36.svg|20px]]||g||{{script|Runr|\u16b7}}\n|[[Image:Certh AU.svg|20px]]||y||{{script|Runr|\u16a3}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 47.svg|20px]]||h||{{script|Runr|\u16bb}}\n|[[Image:Certh 17.svg|20px]]||z||{{script|Runr|\u16e3}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 39.svg|20px]]||i, j||{{script|Runr|\u16c1}}\n|[[Image:Certh 57.svg|20px]]||th||{{script|Runr|\u16a6}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc K.svg|20px]]||k *||\n|[[Image:Certh 27.svg|20px]]||ea||{{script|Runr|\u16e0}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 8.svg|20px]]||l||{{script|Runr|\u16da}}\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc ST.svg|20px]]||st||{{script|Runr|\u16e5}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc M.svg|20px]]||m||{{script|Runr|\u16d7}}\n|[[Image:Certh 42.svg|20px]]||ee||{{script|Runr|\u16df}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 32.svg|20px]]||n||{{script|Runr|\u16be}}\n|[[Image:Certh 43.svg|20px]]||ng||{{script|Runr|\u16dd}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[Image:Certh 24.svg|20px]]||o||{{script|Runr|\u16a9}}\n|[[Image:Tolkien's Futhorc EO.svg|20px]]||eo||{{script|Runr|\u16c7}}\n|}\n</center>\n\nTwo other runes, not attested in ''The Hobbit'', were added by Tolkien in order to represent additional English sounds:\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The swords found in the [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]]s' cave (which were from the ancient kingdom of [[Gondolin]]) bore runes that [[Gandalf]] could not read. In fact, the swords [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]] and [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Orcrist|Orcrist]], forged in Gondolin,  bore a type of letters known as '''''Gondolinic runes'''''. They seem to have been obsoleted and forgotten by the [[Third Age]], and this is supported by the fact that only [[Elrond]] could read the inscriptions of the swords.<br>\nTolkien devised this runic alphabet in a very early stage of his shaping of Middle-earth, but they are known to us only from a slip of paper written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a photocopy of which [[Christopher Tolkien]] sent to Paul Nolan Hyde in February 1992, who published it, together with an extensive analysis, in the 1992 Summer issue of [[Mythlore]], no. 69.<ref>http://www.mythsoc.org/mythlore/mythlore-69.htm</ref><ref>http://www.oocities.org/tyalie/runegond.html</ref><br />\nThe system provides sounds not found in the known Elven languages of the First Age, but perhaps it was designed for notating a variety of languages. However, the consonants seem to be, more or less, the same found in [[Welsh phonology]], a theory supported by the fact that Tolkien was heavily influenced by [[Welsh language|Welsh]] when creating Elven languages.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13472344 BBC article] on Tolkien's Welsh influences.</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|+ Consonants\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=3|<small>[[Labial consonant|Labial]]</small>\n!colspan=9|<small>[[Dental consonant|Dentals]]</small>\n!colspan=3|<small>[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]</small>\n!colspan=3|<small>[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]</small>\n!colspan=3|<small>[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]</small>\n|- align=\"center\"\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n!colspan=2|<small>'''Rune'''</small>||<small>'''[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]'''</small>\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes but is in any case much more obscure.<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Cirth#Inspiration \"Inspiration\"] on Tolkien Gateway wiki.</ref>\n\nThe division between the older Cirth of Daeron and their adaptation by Dwarves and Men has been interpreted as a parallel drawn by Tolkien to the development of the Fu\u00feorc to the [[Younger Fu\u00feark]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Mittelerde: Tolkien und die germanische Mythologie |trans-title=Middle-earth: Tolkien and Germanic Mythology |first=Rudolf |last=Simek |language=German |authorlink=Rudolf Simek |pages=155\u2013156 |publisher=C.

Similar to the Germanic tribes who had no written literature and used only simple runes before their conversion to Christianity, the Sindar Elves of Beleriand with their Cirth were introduced to the more elaborate Tengwar of F\u00ebanor when the Noldor Elves returned to Middle-earth from the lands of the divine [[Valar]].<ref>{{cite conference  |booktitle=Semiotics Around the World: Synthesis in Diversity.

Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], [[maritime patrol]], and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[Tactical airlift|tactical airlifter]] for many military forces worldwide. More than 40 variants of the Hercules, including a civilian one marketed as the [[Lockheed L-100]], operate in more than 60 nations.\n\nThe C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft{{refn|The C-130 was fifth aircraft after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer as of 2007.|group= N}} to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which is the [[United States Air Force]] for the C-130.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The C-130 Hercules is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at over 60 years, with the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] currently being produced.<ref>{{cite web |title=C-130 aircraft designed in the 1950s still delivers |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |date=29 December 2015 |access-date=2 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Background and requirements===\nThe [[Korean War]] showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports\u2014[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s\u2014were no longer adequate.

Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed specifically as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage.\n\nA key feature was the introduction of the [[Allison T56]] [[turboprop]] powerplant, which was developed for the C-130. At the time, the turboprop was a new application of [[gas turbine]]s, which offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure [[turbojet]]s, which were faster but consumed more fuel. They also produced much more power for their weight than piston engines.\n\n===Design phase===\nThe Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the [[Chase XCG-20|Chase XCG-20 Avitruc]], which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm \"Chase XCG-20 Avitruc.\"] ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] also had a rear ramp, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the plane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included low-altitude extraction for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised \"[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]\" bombs.\n\nThe new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down. Fairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.\n\nThe Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130-page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.<ref name=\"rhodes\">Rhodes, Jeff. \"Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules.\" ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004.</ref> [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, \"If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.\"<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.<ref name=\"boyne\">Boyne, Walter J.

Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A-models were equipped with [[ski]]s and re-designated ''C-130D''.  As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added with wing pylon-mounted tanks outboard of the engines; this added 6,000 lb of fuel capacity for a total capacity of 40,000 lb.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Lockheed C-130 Hercules flight deck.jpg|thumb|Lockheed C-130 Hercules flight deck.

Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aeroproducts three-blade propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models.  The C-130B had [[aileron]]s with boost increased from {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}, as well as uprated engines and four-blade propellers that were standard until the J-model's introduction.\n\nAn electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.\n\nThe extended-range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[aileron]]s was reduced back to {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966\u201367 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.\n\nThe ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F'' procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&nbsp;US gal (13,626&nbsp;L) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&nbsp;US gal per minute (19&nbsp;L per second) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:RAAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules AVV Creek.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force]] C-130H, 2007]]\n\nThe ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with certain amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range.<ref>Cassidy, J. \"[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA391744 C-130 Transportability of Army Vehicles]\" p. 3. ''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'', 2001</ref> The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered RAAF Service in 1958.  The U.S. Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.\n\n[[File:USCG_HC-130H.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Coast Guard]] HC-130H]]\nC-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF.

The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&nbsp;in (2.54&nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&nbsp;in (2.03&nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-testbed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130K (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm \"C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.\"] ''doppeladler.com.''

The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.\n\n[[File:HC-130P-N refuels HH-60G.jpg|thumb|USAF HC-130P refuels a [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter]]\nThe ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.\n\nThe ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.\n\nThe RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].\n\nThe ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.\n\n===Next generation===\n{{main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.\n\nBuilding on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html NASA and Lockheed Martin Partners In C-130 Technology] Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref>  Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf The High Technology Test Bed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123150753/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf |date=23 January 2013 }} Lockheed Service News Vol. 12 No. 3, September 1985.

The new aircraft is to carry a 190 percent greater payload and assume the mission of mounted vertical maneuver (MVM). The greater payload and mission would enable it to carry medium-weight armored vehicles and drop them off at locations without long runways.  Various options are being considered, including new or upgraded fixed-wing designs, rotorcraft, [[tiltrotor]]s, or even an [[airship]]. Development could start in 2014, and become operational by 2024. The C-130 fleet of around 450 planes would be replaced by only 250 aircraft.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2010/10/usaf-asks-industry-to-answer-c/ USAF asks industry to answer C-130 replacement questions] - Flightglobal.com, 22 October 2010</ref> The Air Force had attempted to replace the C-130 in the 1970s through the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project, which resulted in the [[C-17 Globemaster III]] that instead replaced the [[C-141 Starlifter]].<ref name=\"speedagile\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/09/images-lockheeds-stealth-c-130/ Lockheed's stealth C-130 successor revealed] - Flightglobal.com, 13 September 2011</ref> The [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] funded Lockheed and Boeing demonstrators for the '''Speed Agile''' concept, which had the goal of making a STOL aircraft that can take off and land at speeds as low as {{convert|70|kn|abbr=on}} on airfields less than 2,000&nbsp;ft (610&nbsp;m) long and cruise at Mach 0.8-plus.

An aircraft would be produced from the early 2030s to the 2040s. If requirements are decided for operating in contested airspace, Air Force procurement of C-130s would end by the end of the decade to not have them serviceable by the 2030s and operated when they cannot perform in that environment.

After the failure of the [[Black Cat Squadron]] to plant operating sensor pods near the [[Lop Nur]] Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a [[Lockheed U-2]], the [[CIA]] developed a plan, named ''Heavy Tea'', to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a Black Bat Squadron crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months before their batteries failed. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets. Another mission to the area was planned as Operation ''Golden Whip'', but was called off in 1970.<ref>Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights over China from Taiwan 1951\u20131969''.

It is a single-sided, 170 kB version of the [[Commodore 1571]], released as a stopgap measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms (supplied from an outside manufacturer). Like the 1571, it can read and write both [[Group Coded Recording|GCR]] and [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] disk formats.\nThe 1570 utilizes a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541|original-1541]]-like case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541's except that it was equipped with track-zero detection. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provides a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541 can. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contains some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later. The 1570 can read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]]-format disks that the 1571 can access.\n\nAlthough the 1570 is compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 isn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it's little more than a pricier 1541. Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.\n\nThe drive uses the CPU [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]], floppy controller [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1770]] or WD1772, I/O controllers 2x [[MOS Technology 6522]] and 1x [[MOS Technology 6526]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commodore disk drives}}\n\n[[Category:Commodore 64]]\n[[Category:CBM floppy disk drives]]", "sha1": "996u5gkelaubg5xxtiyrpjzi14hiup2"}}, {"title": "Commodore 1571", "ns": "0", "id": "7700", "revision": {"id": "832564821", "parentid": "832562043", "timestamp": "2018-03-26T19:14:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Beetstra", "id": "855858"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/Geraldholdsworth|Geraldholdsworth]] ([[User talk:Geraldholdsworth|talk]]) to last version by Frietjes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox information appliance  <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_information_appliance -->\n| name         = Commodore 1571\n| title        = \n| image        = VC1571.JPG\n| caption      = Commodore 1571 floppy drive\n| manufacturer = Commodore Business Machines, Inc.\n| type         = Floppy drive\n| releasedate  = {{Start date|1985||}}\n| price <!--intro--> = 300 USD (1985) USD {{Inflation|US|300|1985|fmt=c|r=-2}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} equivalent)\n| discontinued = \n| media        = 5\u00bc\" [[floppy disk]] [[Floppy disk format#Single Sided, Double Density|DS]] [[Floppy disk format#Single Sided, Double Density|DD]] using [[Group coded recording|GCR]] or [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]<ref name=z71>{{cite web\n|title=Commodore 1571 Disk Drive : Coming up to par:\n|date=2015-03-20\n|accessdate=2016-04-27\n|url=https://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/d1571s.html\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326051411/http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/d1571s.html\n|archivedate=2016-03-26\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n| os           = [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS 3.0]]<ref name=z71/> {{nowrap|([[Commodore 128#Commodore 128D|128D]] uses v3.1)}}\n| power        = <!--220 V 50 Hz ?

With its [[Double-sided disk|double-sided]] drive mechanism, it has the ability to use double-sided, double-density (DS/DD) floppy disks natively. This is in contrast to its predecessors, the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1570|1570]], which can fully read and write such disks only if the user manually [[Flippy disk|flipped them over]] to access the second side. Because flipping the disk also reverses the direction of rotation, the two methods are not interchangeable; disks which had their back side created in a 1541 by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the 1571 too, and the back side of disks written in a 1571 using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a 1541.\n\n== Release & features ==\n\nThe 1571 was released to match the [[Commodore 128]], both design-wise and feature-wise. It was announced in the summer of 1985, at the same time as the C128, and became available in quantity later that year. The later C128''D'' had a 1571-compatible drive integrated in the system unit. A double-sided disk on the 1571 would have a capacity of 340 [[kilobyte|kB]] (70 tracks, 1,360 disk blocks of 256 [[byte]]s each); as 8 kB are reserved for system use (directory and block availability information) and, under {{nowrap|[[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS]],}} {{nowrap|2 bytes}} of each block serve as pointers to the next logical block, {{nowrap|254 x 1,328}} = 337,312 [[byte|B]] or about {{nowrap|329.4 kB}} were available for user data. (However, with a program organizing disk storage on its own, all space could be used, e.g. for data disks.)\n\nThe 1571 was designed to accommodate the C128's \"burst\" mode for 2x faster disk access, however the drive cannot use it if connected to older Commodore machines. This mode replaced the slow [[bit-banging]] serial routines of the 1541 with a true serial [[shift register]] implemented in hardware, thus dramatically increasing the drive speed. Although this originally had been planned when Commodore first switched from the parallel [[IEEE-488]] interface to a custom serial interface ([[Commodore bus|CBM-488]]), hardware bugs in the VIC-20's [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]] shift register prevented it from working properly.<ref name=\"b64notes\">{{cite web|title=Binary Dinosaurs - C64 Notes |url=http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php |date=1994-04-07 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>\n\nWhen connected to a C128, the 1571 would default to double-sided mode, which allowed the drive to read its own 340k disks as well as single-sided 170 kB 1541 disks. If the C128 was switched into C64 mode by typing GO 64 from BASIC, the 1571 will stay in double-sided mode. If C64 mode was activated by holding down the C= key on power-up, the drive would automatically switch to single-sided mode, in which case it is unable to read 340 kB disks (also the default if a 1571 is used with a C64, Plus/4, VIC-20, or PET). A manual command can also be issued from BASIC to switch the 1571 between single and double sided mode. There is also an undocumented command which allows the user to independently control either of the read/write heads of the 1571, making it possible to format both sides of a diskette separate from each other, however the resultant disk cannot be read in a 1541 as it would be spinning in reverse direction when flipped upside down. In the same vein, \"flippy\" disks created with a 1541 cannot be read on a 1571 with this feature; they must be inserted upside down.\n\nThe 1571 is not 100% low-level compatible with the 1541, however this isn't a problem except in some software that uses advanced copy protections such as the RapidLok system found on [[Microprose]] and [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] games.\n\nThe 1571 was noticeably quieter than its predecessor and tended to run cooler as well, even though, like the 1541, it had an internal power supply (later Commodore drives, like the 1541-II and the 3\u00bd\" [[Commodore 1581|1581]], came with external power supplies). The 1541-II/1581 power supply makes mention of a 1571-II, hinting that Commodore may have intended to release a version of the 1571 with an external power supply. However, no 1571-IIs are known to exist. The embedded OS in the 1571 was {{nowrap|[[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS]]}} {{nowrap|V3.0 1571,}} an improvement over the {{nowrap|1541's V2.6.}}{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nEarly 1571s had a bug in the ROM-based disk operating system that caused relative files to corrupt if they occupied both sides of the disk.  A version 2 ROM was released, but though it cured the initial bug, it introduced some minor quirks of its own - particularly with the 1541 emulation.  Curiously, it was also identified as V3.0.\n\nAs with the 1541, Commodore initially could not meet demand for the 1571, and that lack of availability and the drive's relatively high price (about US$300) presented an opportunity for cloners. Two 1571 clones appeared, one from Oceanic and one from Blue Chip, but legal action from Commodore quickly drove them from the market.\n\nCommodore announced at the 1985 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] a dual-drive version of the 1571, to be called the '''Commodore 1572''', but quickly canceled it,<ref>{{cite web|title=A nostalgic look back at the Commodore 128\n|date=December 1985 \u2013 January 1986\n|accessdate=2013-01-12\n|url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-09/Info_Issue_09_1985_Dec-Jan_1986#page/n25/mode/2up}}</ref> reportedly due to technical difficulties with the 1572 DOS.  It would have had four times as much RAM as the 1571 (8 kB), and twice as much ROM (64 kB). The 1572 would have allowed for fast disk backups of [[copy protected|non-copy-protected]] media, much like the old [[Commodore 4040|4040]], [[Commodore 8050|8050]], and 8250 dual drives.\n\nThe 1571 built into the European plastic-case C128 D computer is electronically identical to the stand-alone version, but 1571 version integrated into the later metal-case C128 D (often called C128 DCR, for D Cost-Reduced) differs a lot from the stand-alone 1571. It includes a newer DOS, version 3.1, replaces the [[MOS Technology CIA]] interface chip, of which only a few features were used by the 1571 DOS, with a very much simplified chip called 5710, and has some compatibility issues with the stand-alone drive. Because this internal 1571 does not have an unused 8-bit input/output port on any chip, unlike most other Commodore drives, it is not possible to install a parallel cable in this drive, such as that used by [[SpeedDOS]], [[DolphinDOS]] and some other fast third-party Commodore DOS replacements.\n\n== Technical design ==\nThe drive detects the motor speed and generates an internal data sampling clock signal that matches with the motor speed.<ref>{{cite web|title=20 Pin Gate array (continued)\n|publication-date=October 1986\n|accessdate=2016-04-27\n|url=ftp://www.zimmers.net/pub/cbm/schematics/drives/new/1571/manual/05.html}}</ref>\n\nThe 1571 uses a saddle canceler when reading the data stream. A correction signal is generated when the raw data pattern on the disk consists of two consecutive zeros. With the [[Group coded recording|GCR]] recording format a problem occurs in the read signal waveform. The worst case pattern 1001 may cause a saddle condition where a false data bit may occur. The original 1541 drives uses a one-shot to correct the condition. The 1571 uses a gate array to corrected this digitally.<ref>{{cite web|title=20 Pin Gate array 1541B and 1571\n|publication-date=October 1986\n|accessdate=2016-04-27\n|url=ftp://www.zimmers.net/pub/cbm/schematics/drives/new/1571/manual/04.html}}</ref>\n\nThe drive uses the [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] CPU, [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1770]] or WD1772 floppy controller, 2x [[MOS Technology 6522]] I/O controllers and 1x [[MOS Technology 6526]].<!--de:Commodore 128 article says so-->\n\n== Disk format ==\nUnlike the 1541, which was limited to [[Group Coded Recording|GCR]] formatting, the 1571 could read both GCR and [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] disk formats. The version of CP/M included with the C128 supported the following formats:\n\n* [[IBM PC]] [[CP/M-86]]\n* [[Osborne 1]] (double density upgrade)\n* [[Epson]] QX10\n* [[Kaypro]] II, IV\n* CBM CP/M FORMAT SS \n* CBM CP/M FORMAT DS\n\nIf the CP/M BIOS is modified, it is possible to read any soft sector 40-track MFM format. Single density (FM) formats are not supported because the density selector pin on the MFM controller chip in the drive is disabled (wired to ground).\n\nA 1571 cannot boot from MFM disks; the user must boot CP/M from a GCR disk and then switch to MFM disks.\n\nWith additional software, it was possible to read and write to [[MS-DOS]]-formatted floppies as well. Numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available, the best-known being [[SOGWAP]]'s \"Big Blue Reader\". Although the C128 could not run any DOS-based software, this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with PC users. Reading {{nowrap|[[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]]}} {{nowrap|130 kB}} or {{nowrap|180 kB}} disks was possible as well with special software, but the standard {{nowrap|Atari 8-bit}} {{nowrap|90 kB}} format, which used [[Frequency modulation|FM]] rather than [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] encoding, could not be handled by the 1571 hardware without modifying the drive circuitry as the control line that determines if FM or MFM encoding is used by the disc controller chip was permanently wired to ground (MFM mode) rather than being under software control.\n\nIn the 1541 format, while 40 tracks are possible for a {{nowrap|5.25\" DD}} drive like the 154x/157x, only {{nowrap|35 tracks}} are used. Commodore chose not to use the upper five tracks by default (or at least to use more than 35) due to the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms, which did not always work reliably on those tracks.\n\nFor compatibility and ease of implementation, the 1571's double-sided format of one logical disk side with {{nowrap|70 tracks}} was created by putting together the lower 35 physical tracks on each of the physical sides of the disk rather than using two times {{nowrap|40 tracks,}} even though there were no more quality problems with the mechanisms of the 1571 drives.\n\n== References ==\n* Ellinger, Rainer (1986).

The juices are absorbed slowly by the mucous membrane of the inner cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed. Alternatively, coca leaves can be infused in liquid and consumed like tea. Ingesting coca leaves generally is an inefficient means of administering cocaine.\n\nBecause cocaine is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and rendered inactive in the acidic stomach, it is not readily absorbed when ingested alone. Only when mixed with a highly alkaline substance (such as [[Lime (material)|lime]]) can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach. The efficiency of absorption of orally administered cocaine is limited by two additional factors. First, the drug is partly catabolized by the liver. Second, capillaries in the mouth and esophagus constrict after contact with the drug, reducing the surface area over which the drug can be absorbed. Nevertheless, cocaine metabolites can be detected in the urine of subjects that have sipped even one cup of coca leaf infusion.\n\nOrally administered cocaine takes approximately 30&nbsp;minutes to enter the bloodstream. Typically, only a third of an oral dose is absorbed, although absorption has been shown to reach 60% in controlled settings. Given the slow rate of absorption, maximum [[physiological]] and [[psychotropic]] effects are attained approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after cocaine is administered by ingestion. While the onset of these effects is slow, the effects are sustained for approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after their peak is attained.\n\nContrary to popular belief, both ingestion and [[insufflation]] result in approximately the same proportion of the drug being absorbed: 30 to 60%. Compared to ingestion, the faster absorption of insufflated cocaine results in quicker attainment of maximum drug effects. Snorting cocaine produces maximum physiological effects within 40&nbsp;minutes and maximum psychotropic effects within 20&nbsp;minutes, however, a more realistic activation period is closer to 5 to 10&nbsp;minutes. Physiological and psychotropic effects from nasally insufflated cocaine are sustained for approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;minutes after the peak effects are attained.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnett G, Hawks R, Resnick R | title = Cocaine pharmacokinetics in humans | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 3 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 353\u201366 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7242115 | doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(81)90063-5 }}; Jones, supra note 19; Wilkinson ''et al.'', Van Dyke ''et al.''</ref>\n\n[[Coca tea]], an infusion of coca leaves, is also a traditional method of consumption.

Subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection (usually when in excess of 120&nbsp;milligrams) lasting two to 5&nbsp;minutes including [[tinnitus]] and audio distortion.

In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 3.1&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"Volkow\" /> The euphoria passes quickly. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory [[embolism|emboli]] from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. As with all injected illicit substances, there is a risk of the user contracting blood-borne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used. Additionally, because cocaine is a vasoconstrictor, and usage often entails multiple injections within several hours or less, subsequent injections are progressively more difficult to administer, which in turn may lead to more injection attempts and more consequences from improperly performed injection.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAn injected mixture of cocaine and [[heroin]], known as \"[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]\" is a particularly dangerous combination, as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other, but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose. It has been responsible for numerous deaths, including celebrities such as comedians/actors [[John Belushi]] and [[Chris Farley]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[River Phoenix]], grunge singer [[Layne Staley]] and actor [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]].

The drug is then absorbed by the membranes of these body parts. Little research has been focused on the suppository (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration, also known as \"plugging\". This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Cocaine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects is infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would be taken up through the membranes lining its walls.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Adverse effects==\n===Acute===\n{{Main|Cocaine intoxication}}\nWith excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause [[itch]]ing, [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[formication|paranoid delusions]].<ref name=\"weizhao2008\">{{cite book |title=Mechanisms Mediating Sex Differences in the Effects of Cocaine |last=Zhao |first=Wei | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |isbn=978-0-549-99458-9 |page=3 |access-date=25 September 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF8zjRBtSuIC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404151302/http://books.google.com/books?id=AF8zjRBtSuIC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=4 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Overdoses cause [[hyperthermia]] and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening,<ref name=\"weizhao2008\" /> [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s,<ref name=\"Nav\">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary ME, Hancox JC | title = Role of voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels in the development of cocaine-associated cardiac arrhythmias | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 427\u201342 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20573078 | pmc = 2856043 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03629.x }}</ref> and death.<ref name=\"Nav\" />\n\nAnxiety, [[paranoia]], and restlessness can also occur, especially during the comedown.

The free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as \"coca tea\" has been actively promoted by the governments of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] for many years as a drink having medicinal powers. Visitors to the city of [[Cuzco]] in Peru, and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia are greeted with the offering of coca leaf infusions (prepared in teapots with whole coca leaves) purportedly to help the newly arrived traveler overcome the malaise of high altitude sickness. The effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift. It does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine. In order to prevent the demonization of this product, its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids, as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different.\n\nIt has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In one controversial study, coca leaf infusion was used\u2014in addition to counseling\u2014to treat 23 addicted coca-paste smokers in [[Lima]], Peru. Relapses fell from an average of four times per month before treatment with coca tea to one during the treatment. The duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32&nbsp;days prior to treatment to 217&nbsp;days during treatment. These results suggest that the administration of coca leaf infusion plus counseling would be an effective method for preventing relapse during treatment for cocaine addiction. Importantly, these results also suggest strongly that the primary pharmacologically active metabolite in coca leaf infusions is actually cocaine and not the secondary alkaloids.{{synthesis inline|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe cocaine metabolite [[benzoylecgonine]] can be detected in the urine of people a few hours after drinking one cup of coca leaf infusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|title=Coca tea or mate de coca \u2013 the holy coca leaf infusion|work=inkanat.com|access-date=17 December 2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220221155/http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|archive-date=20 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Biosynthesis of cocaine}}\n[[File:Biosynthesis of N-methyl-pyrrolinium cation.png|right|thumb|Biosynthesis of ''N''-methyl-pyrrolinium cation]]\n[[File:Biosynthesis of cocaine.png|thumb|right|Biosynthesis of cocaine]]\n[[File:Robinson biosynthesis of tropane.png|right|thumb|Robinson biosynthesis of tropane]]\n[[File:Reduction of tropinone.png|right|thumb|Reduction of tropinone]]\nThe first synthesis and elucidation of the cocaine molecule was by [[Richard Willst\u00e4tter]] in 1898.<ref name=\"Humphrey2001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Humphrey AJ, O'Hagan D | title = Tropane alkaloid biosynthesis.

Most commercial cocaine immunoassay screening tests cross-react appreciably with the major cocaine metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the cocaine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate a cocaine-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of the metabolites in his system. Cautious interpretation of testing results may allow a distinction between passive or active usage, and between smoking versus other routes of administration.<ref>R.

He proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to [[Milan]] he wrote a paper in which he described the effects. In this paper he declared coca and cocaine (at the time they were assumed to be the same) as being useful medicinally, in the treatment of \"a furred tongue in the morning, [[flatulence]], and whitening of the teeth.\"\n\nA chemist named [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] who read Mantegazza's paper became immediately intrigued with coca and its economic potential. In 1863, Mariani started marketing a [[wine]] called [[Vin Mariani]], which had been treated with coca leaves, to become [[cocawine]]. The [[ethanol]] in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It contained 6&nbsp;mg cocaine per ounce of wine, but Vin Mariani which was to be exported contained 7.2&nbsp;mg per ounce, to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. A \"pinch of coca leaves\" was included in [[John Pemberton|John Styth Pemberton]]'s original 1886 recipe for [[Coca-Cola]], though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was passed.\n\nIn 1879 cocaine began to be used to treat [[morphine]] addiction.

There was a 28% increase from the amount of potentially harvestable coca plants which were grown in Colombia in 1998. This, combined with crop reductions in Bolivia and Peru, made Colombia the nation with the largest area of [[cocaine production in Colombia|coca under cultivation]] after the mid-1990s. Coca grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities, a use which is still present and is permitted by Colombian laws, only makes up a small fragment of total coca production, most of which is used for the illegal drug trade.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAn interview with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by [[acid-base extraction]] that has changed little since 1905. Roughly {{convert|625|lb|kg}} of leaves were harvested per [[hectare]], six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a string trimmer and sprinkled with a small amount of powdered cement (replacing [[sodium carbonate]] from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in {{convert|50|USgal|L}} of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then [[battery acid]] (weak [[sulfuric acid]]) was used, one bucket per {{convert|25|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of leaves, to create a [[phase (matter)|phase]] separation in which the cocaine [[free base]] in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of \"murky-looking smelly liquid\". Once powdered [[caustic soda]] was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth. The resulting material, when dried, was termed ''[[cocaine paste|pasta]]'' and sold by the farmer. The 3750&nbsp;pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced {{convert|2.5|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of ''pasta''<!--- note that this figure is only about \u2153 of the figure inferred from the numbers below --->, approximately 40\u201360% cocaine.

Whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear. These strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown, increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine. Although production fell temporarily, coca crops rebounded in numerous smaller fields in Colombia, rather than the larger plantations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe cultivation of coca has become an attractive economic decision for many growers due to the combination of several factors, including the lack of other employment alternatives, the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs, the eradication-related damages to non-drug farms, the spread of new strains of the coca plant due to persistent worldwide demand.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Estimated Andean region coca cultivation and potential pure cocaine production<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[National Drug Intelligence Center|NDIC]]|title=National Drug Threat Assessment 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs11/18862/index.htm|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111172335/http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs11/18862/index.htm|archive-date=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n! !!2000!!2001!!2002!!2003!!2004\n|-\n| Net cultivation km<sup>2</sup> (sq mi)||{{Convert|1875|km2|mi2|abbr = values}}||{{Convert|2218|km2|mi2|abbr = values}}||{{convert|2007.5|km2|mi2|abbr = values}}||{{Convert|1663|km2|mi2|abbr = values}}||{{Convert|1662|km2|mi2|abbr = values}}\n|-\n| Potential pure cocaine production ([[tonne]]s)||770||925||830||680||645\n|}\n\nThe latest estimate provided by the U.S. authorities on the annual production of cocaine in Colombia refers to 290 metric tons.\nAs of the end of 2011, the seizure operations of [[Colombian cocaine]] carried out in different countries have totaled 351.8 metric tons of cocaine, i.e. 121.3% of Colombia's annual production according to the U.S. Department of State's estimates.\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.flarenetwork.org/report/top_news_100615/article/cocaine_seized_worldwide_highest_ever_in_2011.htm |title=Cocaine Seized Worldwide Highest Ever in 2011 |date=18 January 2012 |publisher=Flare Network (Flarenetwork.org) |access-date=5 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106033115/http://www.flarenetwork.org/report/top_news_100615/article/cocaine_seized_worldwide_highest_ever_in_2011.htm |archive-date=6 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><!--OLD URL:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13210473/NARCOLEAKS%20ENG.pdf Narcoleaks--><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35754.htm |title=Colombia |publisher=State.gov |access-date=26 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402152541/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35754.htm |archive-date=2 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Synthesis====\nSynthetic cocaine would be highly desirable to the illegal drug industry as it would eliminate the high visibility and low reliability of offshore sources and international smuggling, replacing them with clandestine domestic laboratories, as are common for illicit [[methamphetamine]].

The drugs may be strapped to the waist or legs or hidden in bags, or hidden in the body. If the mule gets through without being caught, the gangs will reap most of the profits. If he or she is caught, however, gangs will sever all links and the mule will usually stand trial for trafficking alone.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nBulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western Caribbean\u2013[[Gulf of Mexico]] area. These vessels are typically 150\u2013250-foot (50\u201380&nbsp;m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations.

Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: {{nowrap|(2, 3)}} in green, {{nowrap|(\u22123, 1)}} in red, {{nowrap|(\u22121.5, \u22122.5)}} in blue, and the origin {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} in purple.]]\nA '''Cartesian coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances to the point from two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]]. Each reference line is called a ''coordinate axis'' or just ''axis'' (plural ''axes'') of the system, and the point where they meet is its ''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'', at ordered pair {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}. The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.\n\nOne can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in [[three-dimensional space]] by three Cartesian coordinates, its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In general, ''n'' Cartesian coordinates (an element of [[real n-space|real ''n''-space]]) specify the point in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] for any [[dimension]] ''n''. These coordinates are equal, up to [[sign (mathematics)|sign]], to distances from the point to ''n'' mutually perpendicular [[hyperplane]]s.\n\n[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is {{nowrap|1=(''x'' \u2212 ''a'')<sup>2</sup> + (''y'' \u2212 ''b'')<sup>2</sup> = ''r''<sup>2</sup>}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are the coordinates of the center {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and ''r'' is the radius.]]\n\nThe invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] ([[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] name: ''Cartesius'') revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [[curve]]s) can be described by '''Cartesian equations''': algebraic [[equation]]s involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2, centered at the origin of the plane, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' satisfy the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 4}}.\n\nCartesian coordinates are the foundation of [[analytic geometry]], and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as [[linear algebra]], [[complex analysis]], [[differential geometry]], multivariate [[calculus]], [[group theory]] and more. A familiar example is the concept of the [[graph of a function]]. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[engineering]] and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in [[computer graphics]], [[computer-aided geometric design]] and other [[computational geometry|geometry-related data processing]].\n\n==History==\nThe adjective ''Cartesian'' refers to the French [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] who published this idea in 1637. It was independently discovered by [[Pierre de Fermat]], who also worked in three dimensions, although Fermat did not publish the discovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-geometry|title=Analytic geometry|last=Bix|first=Robert A.|last2=D'Souza|first2=Harry J.|date=|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref> The French cleric [[Nicole Oresme#Mathematics|Nicole Oresme]], used constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVRSDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT307&dq=Nicole+Oresme+coordinate&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh05av6rrbAhVi4YMKHfMJBT4Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=Nicole%20Oresme%20coordinate&f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Mapping and Cartography|last=Kent|first=Alexander J.|last2=Vujakovic|first2=Peter|date=2017-10-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317568216|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoth Descartes and Fermat used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' ''[[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]]'' was translated into Latin in 1649 by [[Frans van Schooten]] and his students. These commentators introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=p. 374}}</ref>\n\nThe development of the Cartesian coordinate system would play a fundamental role in the development of the [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].<ref>A Tour of the Calculus, David Berlinski</ref> The two-coordinate description of the plane was later generalized into the concept of [[vector spaces]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6|title=Linear Algebra Done Right - Springer|last=Axler|first=Sheldon|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6|via=}}</ref>\n\nMany other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes, such as the [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] for the plane, and the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] for three-dimensional space.\n\n==Description==\n\n===One dimension {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in one dimension}}===\n{{Main article|number line}}\nChoosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a one-dimensional space{{snd}} that is, for a straight line\u2014involves choosing a point ''O'' of the line (the origin), a unit of length, and an orientation for the line. An orientation chooses which of the two half-lines determined by ''O'' is the positive, and which is negative; we then say that the line \"is oriented\" (or \"points\") from the negative half towards the positive half. Then each point ''P'' of the line can be specified by its distance from ''O'', taken with a + or \u2212 sign depending on which half-line contains ''P''.\n\nA line with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''number line'''. Every real number has a unique location on the line. Conversely, every point on the line can be interpreted as a [[number]] in an ordered continuum such as the real numbers.\n\n===Two dimensions {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions}}===\n{{Further information|two-dimensional space}}\nA Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (also called a '''rectangular coordinate system''' or an '''orthogonal coordinate system'''<ref name=\":0\" />) is defined by an [[ordered pair]] of [[perpendicular]] lines (axes), a single [[unit of length]] for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a number line.   For any point ''P'', a line is drawn through ''P'' perpendicular to each axis, and the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number.  The two numbers, in that chosen order, are the ''Cartesian coordinates'' of ''P''.  The reverse construction allows one to determine the point ''P'' given its coordinates.\n\nThe first and second coordinates are called the ''[[abscissa]]'' and the ''[[ordinate]]'' of ''P'', respectively; and the point where the axes meet is called the ''origin'' of the coordinate system.   The coordinates are usually written as two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in {{nowrap|(3, -10.5)}}.  Thus the origin has coordinates {{nowrap|(0,0)}}, and the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin, have coordinates {{nowrap|(1,0)}} and {{nowrap|(0,1)}}.\n\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering, the first axis is usually defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right, and the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards.  (However, in some [[computer graphics]] contexts, the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards.) The origin is often labeled ''O'', and the two coordinates are often denoted by the letters ''X'' and ''Y'', or ''x'' and ''y''. The axes may then be referred to as the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis.   The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values. \n\nA [[Euclidean plane]] with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system ''Cartesian plane''.  In a Cartesian plane one can define canonical representatives of certain geometric figures, such as the [[unit circle]] (with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin), the [[unit square]] (whose diagonal has endpoints at {{nowrap|(0,0)}} and {{nowrap|(1,1)}}),  the  [[unit hyperbola]], and so on.\n\nThe two axes divide the plane into four [[right angle]]s, called ''quadrant''.  The quadrants may be named or numbered in various ways, but the quadrant where all coordinates are  positive is usually called the ''first quadrant''.\n\nIf the coordinates of a point are {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}}, then its [[distance from a point to a line|distances]] from the ''X''-axis and from the ''Y''-axis are |''y''| and |''x''|, respectively; where |...| denotes the [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] of a number.\n\n===Three dimensions {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions}} ===\n{{Further information|three-dimensional space}}\n\n[[File:Coord system CA 0.svg|thumb|240px|A three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, with origin ''O'' and axis lines ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'', oriented as shown by the arrows. The tick marks on the axes are one length unit apart. The black dot shows the point with coordinates {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 4}}, or {{nowrap|(2, 3, 4)}}.]]\n\nA Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space consists of an ordered triplet of lines (the ''axes'') that go through a common point (the ''origin''), and are pair-wise perpendicular; an orientation  for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes.  As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line.  For any point ''P'' of space, one considers a plane through ''P'' perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and interprets the point where that plane cuts the axis as a number.  The Cartesian coordinates of ''P'' are those three numbers, in the chosen order. The reverse construction determines the point ''P'' given its three coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, each coordinate of a point ''P'' can be taken as the distance from ''P'' to the plane defined by the other two axes, with the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis. \n\nEach pair of axes defines a ''coordinate plane''. These planes divide space into eight [[trihedron|trihedra]], called ''octants''.\n\nThe coordinates are usually written as three numbers (or algebraic formulas) surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas, as in {{nowrap|(3,-2.5,1)}} or {{nowrap|(''t'',''u''+''v'',\u03c0/2)}}.  Thus, the origin has coordinates {{nowrap|(0,0,0)}}, and the unit points on the three axes are {{nowrap|(1,0,0)}}, {{nowrap|(0,1,0)}}, and {{nowrap|(0,0,1)}}.\n\nThere are no standard names for the coordinates in the three axes. The coordinates are often denoted by the letters ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' (or ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''), in which case the lines are called the ''X''-, ''Y''-, and ''Z''-axis, respectively.  Then the coordinate planes can be referred to as the ''XY''-, ''YZ''-, and ''XZ''-planes.\n\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts, the first two axes are often defined or depicted as horizontal, with the third axis pointing up.   In that case the third coordinate may be called ''height'' or ''altitude''.  The orientations are usually chosen so that the 90 degree angle from the first axis to the second axis looks counter-clockwise when seen from the point {{nowrap|(0,0,1)}}; a convention that is commonly called ''the [[right hand rule]]''.\n\n[[File:Cartesian coordinate surfaces.png|thumb|240px|right| The [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] of the Cartesian coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}.  The ''z''-axis is vertical and the ''x''-axis is highlighted in green.  Thus, the red plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 1}}, the blue plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 1}}, and the yellow plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''y'' = \u22121}}. The three surfaces intersect at the point ''P'' (shown as a black sphere) with the Cartesian coordinates {{nowrap|(1, \u22121, 1}}).]]\n\n===Higher dimensions===\nA [[Euclidean plane]] with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''Cartesian plane'''.  Since Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous, the points of a Cartesian plane can be identified with pairs of [[real number]]s; that is with the [[Cartesian product]] <math>\\R^2 = \\R\\times\\R</math>, where <math>\\R</math> is the set of all reals.  In the same way, the points in any [[Euclidean space]] of dimension ''n''  be identified with the [[tuple]]s (lists) of ''n'' real numbers, that is, with the Cartesian product <math>\\R^n</math>.\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe concept of Cartesian coordinates generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other, and/or different units along each axis.  In that case, each coordinate is obtained by projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis (or, in general, to the [[hyperplane]] defined by all the other axes). In such an '''oblique coordinate system''' the computations of distances and angles must be modified from that in standard Cartesian systems, and many standard formulas (such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance) do not hold (see [[affine plane]]).\n\n==Notations and conventions==<!-- [[Abscissa]] redirects here -->\n\nThe Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in [[parentheses]] and separated by commas, as in {{nowrap|(10, 5)}} or {{nowrap|(3, 5, 7)}}.  The origin is often labelled with the capital letter ''O''. In analytic geometry, unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters (''x'', ''y'') in the plane, and (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three-dimensional space. This custom comes from a convention of algebra, which uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values (such as were the coordinates of points in many geometric problems), and letters near the beginning for given quantities.\n\nThese conventional names are often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering, although other letters may be used.  For example, in a graph showing how a [[pressure]] varies with [[time]], the graph coordinates may be denoted ''p'' and ''t''.  Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the ''x-axis'', the ''y-axis'', the ''t-axis'', etc.\n\nAnother common convention for coordinate naming is to use subscripts, as (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) for the ''n'' coordinates in an ''n''-dimensional space, especially when ''n'' is greater than 3 or unspecified.  Some authors prefer the numbering (''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>).  These notations are especially advantageous in [[computer programming]]: by storing the coordinates of a point as an [[Array data type|array]], instead of a [[record (computer science)|record]], the [[subscript]] can serve to index the coordinates.\n\nIn mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the first coordinate (traditionally called the [[abscissa]]) is measured along a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] axis, oriented from left to right.  The second coordinate (the [[ordinate]]) is then measured along a [[vertical direction|vertical]] axis, usually oriented from bottom to top. Young children learning the Cartesian system, commonly learn the order to read the values before cementing the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axis concepts, by starting with 2D mnemonics (e.g. 'Walk along the hall then up the stairs' akin to straight across the ''x''-axis then up vertically along the ''y''-axis).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Charts_and_Diagrams.htm|title=Charts and Graphs: Choosing the Right Format|website=www.mindtools.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\nComputer graphics and [[image processing]], however, often use a coordinate system with the ''y''-axis oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in [[framebuffer|display buffers]].\n\nFor three-dimensional systems, a convention is to portray the ''xy''-plane horizontally, with the ''z''-axis added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the ''x''-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left.  If a diagram ([[3D projection]] or [[Perspective (graphical)|2D perspective drawing]]) shows the ''x''- and ''y''-axis horizontally and vertically, respectively, then the ''z''-axis should be shown pointing \"out of the page\" towards the viewer or camera. In such a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system, the ''z''-axis would appear as a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right, depending on the presumed viewer or camera [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. In any diagram or display, the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary. However, the orientation of the axes relative to each other should always comply with the [[right-hand rule]], unless specifically stated otherwise. All laws of physics and math assume this [[#Orientation and handedness|right-handedness]], which ensures consistency.\n\nFor 3D diagrams, the names \"abscissa\" and \"ordinate\" are rarely used for ''x'' and ''y'', respectively. When they are, the ''z''-coordinate is sometimes called the '''applicate'''. The words ''abscissa'', ''ordinate'' and ''applicate'' are sometimes used to refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Cartesian_orthogonal_coordinate_system|title=Cartesian orthogonal coordinate system|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Quadrants and octants===\n{{Main article|octant (solid geometry)|quadrant (plane geometry)}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Heraldry]] and from [[Quadrant (Cartesian coordinate system)]]-->\n[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|240px|The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system]]\nThe axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called '''quadrants''',<ref name=\":0\" /> each bounded by two half-axes. These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by [[Roman numeral]]s: I (where the signs of the two coordinates are I (+,+), II (\u2212,+), III (\u2212,\u2212), and IV (+,\u2212).  When the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom, the numbering goes [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] starting from the upper right (\"north-east\") quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines a division of space into eight regions or '''octants''',<ref name=\":0\" /> according to the signs of the coordinates of the points.  The convention used for naming a specific octant is to list its signs, e.g. {{nowrap|(+ + +)}} or {{nowrap|(\u2212 + \u2212)}}. The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions is the '''[[orthant]]''', and a similar naming system applies.\n\n==Cartesian formulae for the plane==\n\n===Distance between two points===\nThe [[Euclidean distance]] between two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates <math>(x_1, y_1)</math> and <math>(x_2, y_2)</math> is\n\n:<math>d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}.</math>\n\nThis is the Cartesian version of [[Pythagoras's theorem]].  In three-dimensional space, the distance between points <math>(x_1,y_1,z_1)</math> and <math>(x_2,y_2,z_2)</math> is\n\n:<math>d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2+ (z_2-z_1)^2} ,</math>\n\nwhich can be obtained by two consecutive applications of Pythagoras' theorem.<ref name=\"Hughes\">{{cite book|last1=Hughes-Hallett|first1=Deborah|last2=McCallum|first2=William G.|last3=Gleason|first3=Andrew M.|title=Calculus : Single and Multivariable|date=2013|publisher=John wiley|isbn=978-0470-88861-2|edition=6}}</ref>\n\n===Euclidean transformations===\nThe [[Euclidean plane isometry|Euclidean transformations]] or '''Euclidean motions''' are the ([[bijective]]) mappings of points of the [[Euclidean plane]] to themselves which preserve distances between points. There are four types of these mappings (also called isometries): [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] and [[glide reflection]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Smart|1998|loc=Chap. 2}}</ref>\n\n====Translation====\n[[Translation (geometry)|Translating]] a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set.  That is, if the original coordinates of a point are {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}, after the translation they will be\n\n:<math>(x', y') = (x + a, y + b) .</math>\n\n====Rotation====\nTo [[rotation (geometry)|rotate]] a figure [[clockwise|counterclockwise]] around the origin by some angle <math>\\theta</math> is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (''x'',''y'') by the point with coordinates  (''x<nowiki>'</nowiki>'',''y<nowiki>'</nowiki>''), where\n\n:<math>x'=x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta</math>\n:<math>y'=x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta .</math>\n\nThus:\n\n<math>(x',y') = ((x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta\\,) , (x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta\\,)) .</math>\n\n====Reflection====\nIf {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} are the Cartesian coordinates of a point, then {{nowrap|(\u2212''x'', ''y'')}} are the coordinates of its [[coordinate rotations and reflections|reflection]] across the second coordinate axis (the y-axis), as if that line were a mirror.  Likewise, {{nowrap|(''x'', \u2212''y'')}} are the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis (the x-axis). In more generality, reflection across a line through the origin making an angle <math>\\theta</math> with the x-axis, is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} by the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''\u2032,''y''\u2032)}}, where\n\n:<math>x'=x \\cos 2\\theta + y \\sin 2\\theta</math>\n:<math>y'=x \\sin 2\\theta - y \\cos 2\\theta .</math>\n\nThus:\n<math>(x',y') = ((x \\cos 2\\theta + y \\sin 2\\theta\\,) , (x \\sin 2\\theta - y \\cos 2\\theta\\,)) .</math>\n\n====Glide reflection====\nA glide reflection is the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line. It can be seen that the order of these operations does not matter (the translation can come first, followed by the reflection).\n\n====General matrix form of the transformations====\nThese [[Euclidean transformation]]s of the plane can all be described in a uniform way by using matrices.  The result <math>(x', y')</math> of applying a Euclidean transformation to a point <math>(x,y)</math> is given by the formula\n\n:<math>(x',y') = (x,y) A + b</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is a 2\u00d72 orthogonal [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{nowrap|1=''b'' = (''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>)}} is an arbitrary ordered pair of numbers;<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1998|loc=pg. 49}}</ref> that is,\n\n:<math>x' = x A_{1 1} + y A_{2 1} + b_{1}</math>\n:<math>y' = x A_{1 2} + y A_{2 2} + b_{2},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n::<math>A =  \\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} \\end{pmatrix}.</math> <nowiki>[</nowiki>Note the use of row vectors for point coordinates and that the matrix is written on the right.<nowiki>]</nowiki>\n\nTo be ''orthogonal'', the matrix ''A'' must have [[orthogonal]] rows with same Euclidean length of one, that is,\n\n:<math>A_{1 1} A_{2 1} + A_{1 2} A_{2 2} = 0</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>A_{1 1}^2 + A_{1 2}^2 = A_{2 1}^2 + A_{2 2}^2 = 1.</math>\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that ''A'' times its [[transpose]] must be the [[identity matrix]].  If these conditions do not hold, the formula describes a more general [[affine transformation]] of the plane provided that the [[determinant]] of ''A'' is not zero.\n\nThe formula defines a translation [[if and only if]] ''A'' is the [[identity matrix]].  The transformation is a rotation around some point if and only if ''A'' is a [[rotation matrix]], meaning that\n\n:<math> A_{1 1} A_{2 2} - A_{2 1} A_{1 2} = 1 .</math>\n\nA reflection or glide reflection is obtained when,\n\n:<math> A_{1 1} A_{2 2} - A_{2 1} A_{1 2} = -1 .</math>\n\nAssuming that translation is not used transformations can be combined by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices.\n\n====Affine transformation====\nAnother way to represent coordinate transformations in Cartesian coordinates is through [[affine transformation]]s. In affine transformations an extra dimension is added and all points are given a value of 1 for this extra dimension. The advantage of doing this is that point translations can be specified in the final column of matrix ''A''.  In this way, all of the euclidean transformations become transactable as matrix point multiplications. The affine transformation is given by:\n\n::<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{21} & b_{1} \\\\ A_{12} & A_{22} & b_{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.</math> <nowiki>[</nowiki>Note the matrix ''A'' from above was transposed. The matrix is on the left and column vectors for point coordinates are used.<nowiki>]</nowiki>\nUsing affine transformations multiple different euclidean transformations including translation can be combined by simply multiplying the corresponding matrices.\n\n====Scaling====\nAn example of an affine transformation which is not a Euclidean motion is given by scaling. To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number ''m''. If {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates\n\n:<math>(x',y') = (m x, m y).</math>\n\nIf ''m'' is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if ''m'' is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.\n\n====Shearing====\nA [[shear mapping|shearing transformation]] will push the top of a square sideways to form a parallelogram. Horizontal shearing is defined by:\n\n:<math>(x',y') = (x+y s, y)</math>\n\nShearing can also be applied vertically:\n\n:<math>(x',y') = (x, x s+y)</math>\n\n==Orientation and handedness==\n{{Main article|orientation (mathematics)}}\n{{See also|right-hand rule|axes conventions}}\n\n===In two dimensions===\n[[File:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|left|thumb|The [[right-hand rule]] ]]\nFixing or choosing the ''x''-axis determines the ''y''-axis up to direction.  Namely, the ''y''-axis is necessarily the [[perpendicular]] to the ''x''-axis through the point marked 0 on the ''x''-axis.  But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative.  Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called ''handedness'') of the Cartesian plane.\n\nThe usual way of orienting the axes, with the positive ''x''-axis pointing right and the positive ''y''-axis pointing up (and the ''x''-axis being the \"first\" and the ''y''-axis the \"second\" axis) is considered the ''positive'' or ''standard'' orientation, also called the ''right-handed'' orientation.\n\nA commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the ''[[right-hand rule]]''. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.\n\nThe other way of orienting the axes is following the ''left hand rule'', placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.\n\nWhen pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis towards positive, the curvature of the fingers indicates a positive rotation along that axis.\n\nRegardless of the rule used to orient the axes, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation.  Switching any two axes will reverse the orientation, but switching both will leave the orientation unchanged.\n\n===In three dimensions===\n[[File:Cartesian coordinate system handedness.svg|left|200px|thumb|Fig. 7 \u2013 The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.]]\n[[File:Right hand cartesian.svg|right|thumb|200px|Fig. 8 \u2013 The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes.]]\n\nOnce the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are specified, they determine the [[line (geometry)|line]] along which the ''z''-axis should lie, but there are two possible directions on this line.  The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'.  The standard orientation, where the ''xy''-plane is horizontal and the ''z''-axis points up (and the ''x''- and the ''y''-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the ''xy''-plane if observed from ''above'' the ''xy''-plane) is called '''right-handed''' or '''positive'''.\n\n[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|3D Cartesian coordinate handedness]]\n\nThe name derives from the [[right-hand rule]]. If the [[index finger]] of the right hand is pointed forward, the [[middle finger]] bent inward at a right angle to it, and the [[thumb]] placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative directions of the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes in a ''right-handed'' system.  The thumb indicates the ''x''-axis, the index finger the ''y''-axis and the middle finger the ''z''-axis.  Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.\n\nFigure 7 depicts a left and a right-handed coordinate system.  Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point ''towards'' the observer, whereas the \"middle\"-axis is meant to point ''away'' from the observer.  The red circle is ''parallel'' to the horizontal ''xy''-plane and indicates rotation from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis (in both cases).  Hence the red arrow passes ''in front of'' the ''z''-axis.\n\nFigure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as \"flipping in and out\" between a [[wikt:convex|convex]] cube and a [[wikt:concave|concave]] \"corner\".  This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the coordinate system.  Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system.  Thus the \"correct\" way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the ''x''-axis as pointing ''towards'' the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Representing a vector in the standard basis==\nA point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system may also be represented by a position [[Euclidean vector|vector]], which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1998|loc=Appendix 2, pp. 377\u2013382}}</ref> If the coordinates represent spatial positions (displacements), it is common to represent the vector from the origin to the point of interest as <math>\\mathbf{r}</math>. In two dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) can be written as:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r} = x \\mathbf{i} + y \\mathbf{j} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math> are [[unit vectors]] in the direction of the ''x''-axis and ''y''-axis respectively, generally referred to as the ''[[standard basis]]'' (in some application areas these may also be referred to as [[versor]]s). Similarly, in three dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates <math>(x,y,z)</math> can be written as:<ref>{{Cite book| author = David J. Griffiths | title = Introduction to Electrodynamics | publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn= 0-13-805326-X}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r} = x \\mathbf{i} + y \\mathbf{j} + z \\mathbf{k} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} </math> is the unit vector in the direction of the z-axis.\n\nThere is no ''natural'' interpretation of multiplying vectors to obtain another vector that works in all dimensions, however there is a way to use [[complex number]]s to provide such a multiplication. In a two dimensional cartesian plane, identify the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} with the complex number {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + '''i'''''y''}}. Here, '''i''' is the [[imaginary unit]] and is identified with the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1)}}, so it is '''not''' the unit vector in the direction of the ''x''-axis. Since the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number, this identification provides a means to \"multiply\" vectors. In a three dimensional cartesian space a similar identification can be made with a subset of the [[quaternion]]s.\n\n==Applications==\nCartesian coordinates are an abstraction that have a multitude of possible applications in the real world.  However, three constructive steps are involved in superimposing coordinates on a problem application.  1) Units of distance must be decided defining the spatial size represented by the numbers used as coordinates.  2) An origin must be assigned to a specific spatial location or landmark, and 3) the orientation of the axes must be defined using available directional cues for all but one axis.\n\nConsider as an example superimposing 3D Cartesian coordinates over all points on the Earth (i.e. geospatial 3D). What units make sense?   Kilometers are a good choice, since the original definition of the kilometer was geospatial...10&nbsp;000&nbsp;km equalling the surface distance from the Equator to the North Pole. Where to place the origin?  Based on symmetry, the gravitational center of the Earth suggests a natural landmark (which can be sensed via satellite orbits).  Finally, how to orient X-, Y- and Z-axis directions?   The axis of Earth's spin provides a natural direction strongly associated with \"up vs. down\", so positive Z can adopt the direction from geocenter to North Pole. A location on the Equator is needed to define the X-axis, and the [[prime meridian]] stands out as a reference direction, so the X-axis takes the direction from geocenter out to [ 0 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude ]. Note that with 3 dimensions, and two perpendicular axes directions pinned down for X and Z, the Y-axis is determined by the first two choices.  In order to obey the right-hand rule, the Y-axis must point out from the geocenter to  [ 90 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude ]. So what are the geocentric coordinates of the Empire State Building in New York City?   Using [ longitude = \u221273.985656, latitude = 40.748433 ], Earth radius = 40,000/2\u03c0, and transforming from spherical --> Cartesian coordinates, you can estimate the geocentric coordinates of the Empire State Building, [ ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ] = [ 1330.53&nbsp;km, \u20134635.75&nbsp;km, 4155.46&nbsp;km ].  GPS navigation relies on such geocentric coordinates.\n\nIn engineering projects, agreement on the definition of coordinates is a crucial foundation.  One cannot assume that coordinates come predefined for a novel application, so knowledge of how to erect a coordinate system where there is none is essential to applying Ren\u00e9 Descartes' ingenious thinking.\n\nWhile spatial apps employ identical units along all axes, in business and scientific apps, each axis may have different [[units of measurement]] associated with it (such as kilograms, seconds, pounds, etc.).  Although four- and higher-dimensional spaces are difficult to visualize, the algebra of Cartesian coordinates can be extended relatively easily to four or more variables, so that certain calculations involving many variables can be done.  (This sort of algebraic extension is what is used to define the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces.)  Conversely, it is often helpful to use the geometry of Cartesian coordinates in two or three dimensions to visualize algebraic relationships between two or three of many non-spatial variables.\n\nThe [[graph of a function]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] is the set of all points satisfying that function or relation. For a function of one variable, ''f'', the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is the graph of the function ''f''. For a function ''g'' of two variables, the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} is the graph of the function ''g''. A sketch of the graph of such a function or relation would consist of all the salient parts of the function or relation which would include its relative extrema, its concavity and points of inflection, any points of discontinuity and its end behavior. All of these terms are more fully defined in calculus. Such graphs are useful in calculus to understand the nature and behavior of a function or relation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Horizontal and vertical]]\n* [[Jones diagram]], which plots four variables rather than two\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Polar coordinate system]]\n* [[Spherical coordinate system]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citation |last1=Brannan |first1=David A. |last2=Esplen |first2=Matthew F. |last3=Gray |first3=Jeremy J. |title=Geometry |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=1998 |isbn=0-521-59787-0}}\n* {{citation |last=Burton |first=David M. |title=The History of Mathematics/An Introduction |year=2011 |edition=7th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |place=New York |isbn=978-0-07-338315-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Smart |first=James R. |title=Modern Geometries |edition=5th |publisher=Brooks/Cole |place=Pacific Grove |year=1998 |isbn=0-534-35188-3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Descartes, Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |translator=Paul J.

At the time, there was no state highway system, since roads were purely a local responsibility. California's roads consisted of crude dirt roads maintained by county governments, as well as some paved roads within city boundaries, and this [[wikt:ad hoc|ad hoc]] system was no longer adequate for the needs of the state's rapidly growing population. After the commissioners submitted their report to the governor on November 25, 1896, the legislature replaced the Bureau with the Department of Highways.<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 12.</ref>\n\nDue to the state's weak fiscal condition and corrupt politics, little progress was made until 1907, when the legislature replaced the Department of Highways with the Department of Engineering, within which there was a Division of Highways.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/> California voters approved an US$18 million bond issue for the construction of a state highway system in 1910, and the first [[California Highway Commission]] was convened in 1911.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/>  On August 7, 1912,

history of Caltrans and its predecessor agencies during the 20th century was marked by many firsts. It was one of the first agencies in the United States to paint [[June McCarroll|centerlines on highways]] statewide; the first to build a [[Arroyo Seco Parkway|freeway west of the Mississippi River]]; the first to build a [[Four Level Interchange|four-level stack interchange]]; the first to develop and deploy non-reflective raised pavement markers, better known as [[Botts' dots]]; and one of the first to implement dedicated freeway-to-freeway connector ramps for [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s.\n\nIn late 1972, the legislature approved a reorganization, suggested by a study initiated by then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], in which the Department of Public Works was merged with the Department of Aeronautics to become the modern California Department of Transportation.<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 128.</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nFor administrative purposes, Caltrans divides the State of California into 12 districts, supervised by district offices. Most districts cover multiple [[County (United States)|counties]]; District 12 ([[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) is the only district with one county. The largest districts by population are District 4 ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and District 7 ([[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties). Like most state agencies, Caltrans maintains its headquarters in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which is covered by District 3.\n\n==Districts==\n[[File:CalTrans District

Vehvil\u00e4inen asserted that the reality of this claim changed when the Finnish forces crossed the 1939 frontier and started annexation operations.{{sfn|Vehvil\u00e4inen|2002|p=91}} The US Library of Congress catalogue also lists the variants '''War of Retribution''' and '''War of Continuation''' (see authority control).|group=\"Note\"}} In Russian historiography, the war is called the '''Soviet\u2013Finnish Front of the Great Patriotic War'''.{{refn|{{lang-ru|\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b}}.

There have been a number of reasons proposed for the Finnish decision to invade, with regaining territory lost during the Winter War being regarded as the most common. Other justifications for the conflict included President [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]]'s vision of a [[Greater Finland]] and Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]]'s desire to liberate Karelia. Plans for the attack were developed jointly between the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and a small faction of Finnish political and military leaders with the rest of the government remaining ignorant. Despite the co-operation in this conflict, Finland never formally signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] that had established the Axis powers and justified its alliance with Germany as self-defense.\n\nIn June 1941, with the start of the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], the Finnish Defence Forces launched their offensive following Soviet airstrikes. By September 1941, Finland [[Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)|occupied East Karelia]] and reversed its post-Winter War concessions to the Soviet Union along the [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|Karelian Isthmus]] and in [[Finnish reconquest of Ladoga Karelia (1941)|Ladoga Karelia]]. The Finnish Army halted its offensive past the old border, around {{Convert|30-32|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the centre of Leningrad and participated in [[Siege of Leningrad|besieging the city]] by cutting its northern supply routes and digging in until 1944.{{refn|See the relevant section and the following sources: <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books/about/The_Siege_of_Leningrad_Epic_of_Survival.html?id=p3FAAAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=The Siege of Leningrad: Epic of Survival|last=Wykes|first=Alan|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|isbn=9780356029580|location=|pages=9-21|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The World War II Desk Reference|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2004|isbn=9780060526511|location=|pages=210}}</ref>{{Sfn|Baryshnikov|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Salisbury|2003|p=246|ps=: \"This line was only twenty miles from the Leningrad city limits.\"}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=4uRmAAAAMAAJ&|title=The Battle for Leningrad: 1941\u20131944|last=Glantz|first=David M.|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=|isbn=9780700612086|location=|pages=416|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302150336/https://books.google.ch/books?id=4uRmAAAAMAAJ&|archivedate=2 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=_oHRAwAAQBAJ|title=Combat and Genocide on the Eastern Front: The German Infantry's War, 1941\u20131944|last=Rutherford|first=Jeff|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107055711|location=|pages=190|language=en|quote=The ensnaring of Leningrad between the German and Finnish armies did not end the combat in the region as the Soviets launched repeated and desperate attempts to regain contact with the city.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153427/https://books.google.ch/books?id=_oHRAwAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=8iQuDwAAQBAJ|title=Leningrad 1941\u201342: Morality in a City under Siege|last=Yarov|first=Sergey|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|others=Foreword by John Barber|year=2017|isbn=9781509508020|location=|pages=7|language=en|quote=While the exact number who died during the siege by the German and Finnish armies from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944 will never be known, available data point to 900,000 civilian deaths, over half a million of whom died in the winter of 1941\u20132 alone.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153547/https://books.google.ch/books?id=8iQuDwAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>|group=\"Note\"}} In [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], joint German\u2013Finnish forces failed to capture [[Murmansk]] or cut the Kirov (Murmansk) Railway, a transit route for [[Lend-Lease|lend-lease]] equipment to the USSR. The conflict stabilised with only minor skirmishes until the tide of the war turned against the Germans and the Soviet Union's strategic [[Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive]] in June 1944. The attack drove the Finns from most of the territories they had gained during the war, but the Finnish Army managed to halt the offensive in August 1944.\n\nHostilities between Finland and the USSR ended with a ceasefire, which was called on 5 September, and formalised by the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September. One of the conditions of this agreement was the expulsion, or disarming, of any German troops in Finnish territory, which led to the [[Lapland War]] between the former co-belligerents. World War II was concluded formally for Finland and the minor Axis powers with the signing of the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] in 1947. The treaties resulted in the restoration of borders per the 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], the ceding of the municipality of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] ({{Lang-ru|Pechengsky raion}}) and the leasing of [[Porkkalanniemi|Porkkala Peninsula]] to the USSR. Furthermore, Finland was required to pay [[United States dollar|$]]300 million in [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to the USSR]].\n\n63,200 Finns and 23,200 Germans died or went missing during the war in addition to 158,000 and 60,400 wounded, respectively.

The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded eastern Poland]] on 17 September.{{sfn|Vehvil\u00e4inen|2002|p=31}} Moscow turned its attention to the [[Baltic states]], demanding that they allow Soviet military bases to be established and troops stationed on their soil.

The government declared national defence to be its first priority, and military expenditure rose to nearly half of public spending. Finland purchased and received donations of war materiel during and immediately after the Winter War.{{sfn|Vehvil\u00e4inen|2002|p=75}} Likewise, Finnish leadership wanted to preserve the [[Spirit of the Winter War|spirit of unanimity]] that was felt throughout the country during the Winter War.

A license to mine the deposit had already been granted to a British-Canadian company, and the demand was rejected by Finland. The following month, the Soviets demanded that Finland destroy the fortifications on the [[\u00c5land islands]] and grant the USSR the right to use Finnish railways to transport Soviet troops to the newly-acquired Soviet base at Hanko. The Finns very reluctantly agreed to these demands.{{sfn|Vehvil\u00e4inen|2002|p=80}} On 24 July, Molotov accused the Finnish government of persecuting the [[Finland \u2013 Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society]], a pro-communist group, and soon afterwards publicly declared support for the group. The society organised demonstrations in Finland, some of which turned into riots.{{sfn|Vehvil\u00e4inen|2002|p=81}}{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=218}}\n\nRussian sources, such as the book ''[[Stalin's Missed Chance]]'', maintain that Soviet policies leading up to the Continuation War were best explained as defensive measures by offensive means. The Soviet division of occupied Poland with Germany, the Soviet [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|occupations of Lithuania]], [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|Latvia]] and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], and the Soviet invasion of Finland in the Winter War are described as elements in the Soviet construction of a security zone, or buffer region, against the perceived threat from the [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers of Western Europe. The Russian sources see the post-World War II establishment of Soviet [[satellite state]]s in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and the [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] as the culmination of the Soviet defence plan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baryshnikov|first=Vladimir N.|date=2002|title=\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f 1932\u20131941 \u0433\u0433|trans-title=The problem of ensuring the security of Leningrad from the north in the light of the implementation of the Soviet military planning of 1932\u20131941|url=http://www.aroundspb.ru/finnish/baryshnikov/pvp1932.php|journal=St. Petersburg and the Countries of Northern Europe|language=ru|publisher=Russian Christian Humanitarian Academy|location=St. Petersburg|volume=|pages=|quote=The actual war with Finland began first of all due to unresolved issues in Leningrad's security from the north and Moscow's concerns for the perspective of Finland's politics.

He also reminded the Germans of the 1939 Soviet\u2013German non-aggression pact.

Similarly, the Finns were distressed by the Allied Invasion of Sicily in July and the German defeat in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in August.

The Parliament of Finland accepted the terms in a secret meeting on 2 September and requested that official negotiations for an armistice begin. The Finnish Army implemented a ceasefire at 8:00 a.m. Helsinki time on 4 September; the Red Army followed suit a day later. On 14 September, a delegation led by Finnish Prime Minister [[Antti Hackzell]] and Foreign Minister [[Carl Enckell]] began negotiating, with the USSR and the United Kingdom, the final terms of the Moscow Armistice, which eventually included additional stipulations from the Soviets.

He also wrote that Stalin had described territorial concessions, reparations and military bases as his objective with Finland to representatives from the UK, in December 1941, and the US, in March 1943, as well as the Tehran Conference.

He argued that there is no documentary evidence for such claims and that the Soviet government was always open for negotiations. Baryshnikov cited, for example, the then-public-information chief of Finnish Headquarters, Major [[Kalle Lehmus]], to show that Finnish leadership had learned of the limited Soviet plans for Finland by at least July 1944 after intelligence revealed that some Soviet divisions were to be transferred to reserve in Leningrad.{{Sfn|Baryshnikov|2002|pp=222\u2013223 (section heading \"\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0432\", paragraph 48 after cit. 409 et seq.)}} Finnish historian [[Heikki Ylikangas]] stated similar findings in 2009.

It has been generalized to any [[commutative ring]], with a formulation involving [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known statement of the theorem, as a problem with specific numbers, appears in the 3rd-century book ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' by the Chinese mathematician Sunzi:<ref name=Katz>{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=197}}</ref>\n\n{{pull quote|There are certain things whose number is unknown.

Let us denote by {{math|''N''}} the product of the {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}}.\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem asserts that if the {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} are [[pairwise coprime]], and if {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>k</sub>''}} are integers such that {{math|0 \u2264 ''a<sub>i</sub>'' < ''n<sub>i</sub>''}} for every {{math|''i''}}, then there is one and only one integer {{math|''x''}}, such that {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' < ''N''}} and the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{math|''x''}} by {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} is {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''}} for every {{math|''i''}}.\n\nThis may be restated as follows in term of [[congruence relation|congruence]]s:\nIf the {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} are pairwise coprime, and if {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>k</sub>''}} are any integers, then there exists an integer {{math|''x''}} such that\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n x &\\equiv a_1  \\pmod{n_1} \\\\\n  &\\vdots \\\\\n x &\\equiv a_k \\pmod{n_k},\n \\end{align}</math>\nand any two such {{math|''x''}} are congruent modulo {{math|''N''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=34}}</ref>\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], the theorem is often restated as: if the {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} are pairwise coprime, the map\n:<math>x\\ \\operatorname{mod} N \\;\\mapsto\\;(x\\ \\operatorname{mod}n_1,\\, \\ldots,\\, x\\ \\operatorname{mod} n_k)</math>\ndefines a [[ring isomorphism]]<ref>{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=35}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\Bbb{Z}/N\\Bbb{Z} \\cong \\Bbb{Z}/n_1\\Bbb{Z} \\times \\cdots \\times \\Bbb{Z}/n_k\\Bbb{Z}</math>\nbetween the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''N''}}]] and the [[direct product]] of the rings of integers modulo the {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. This means that for doing a sequence of arithmetic operations in <math>\\Bbb{Z}/N\\Bbb{Z},</math> one may do the same computation independently in each <math>\\Bbb{Z}/n_i\\Bbb{Z}</math> and then get the result by applying the isomorphism (from the right to the left). This may be much faster than the direct computation if {{math|''N''}} and the number of operations are large. This is widely used, under the name ''multi-modular computation'', for [[linear algebra]] over the integers or the [[rational number]]s.\n\nThe theorem can also be restated in the language of [[combinatorics]] as the fact that the infinite [[arithmetic progression]]s of integers form a [[Helly family]].<ref>{{harvnb|Duchet|1995}}</ref>\n\n==Proof==\nThe existence and the uniqueness of the solution may be proven independently. However, the first proof of existence, given below, uses this uniqueness.\n\n===Uniqueness===\nSuppose that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are both solutions to all the congruences. As {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} give the same remainder, when divided by {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}}, their difference {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} is a multiple of each {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}}. As the {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} are pairwise coprime, their product {{math|''N''}} divides also {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}}, and thus {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are congruent modulo {{math|''N''}}. If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}  are supposed to be non negative and less than {{math|''N''}} (as in the first statement of the theorem), then their difference may be a multiple of {{math|''N''}} only if {{math|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.\n\n===Existence (first proof)===\nThe map\n:<math>x \\mapsto (x \\operatorname{mod} n_1, \\ldots, x\\operatorname{mod} n_k)</math>\nmaps congruence classes modulo {{math|''N''}} to sequences of congruence classes modulo {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}}. The proof of uniqueness shows that this map is [[injective]]. As the [[domain of a function|domain]] and the [[codomain]] of this map have the same number of elements, the map is also [[surjective]], which proves the existence of the solution.\n\nThis proof is very simple but does not provide any direct way for computing a solution. Moreover, it cannot be generalized to other situations where the following proof can.\n\n===Existence (constructive proof)===\nExistence may be established by an explicit construction of {{mvar|x}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosen|1993|page=136}}</ref> This construction may be split into two steps, firstly by solving the problem in the case of two moduli, and the second one by extending this solution to the general case by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the number of moduli.\n\n====Case of two moduli====\nWe want to solve the system:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  x &\\equiv a_1 \\pmod {n_1}\\\\\n  x &\\equiv a_2 \\pmod {n_2},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>n_1</math> and <math>n_2</math> are coprime.\n\n[[B\u00e9zout's identity]] asserts the existence of two integers <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> such that \n:<math>m_1n_1+m_2n_2=1.</math>\nThe integers <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> may be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].\n\nA solution is given by\n:<math>x = a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1.</math>\nIndeed, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx&=a_1m_2n_2+a_2m_1n_1\\\\\n&=a_1(1 - m_1n_1) + a_2m_1n_1 \\\\\n&=a_1 + (a_2 - a_1)m_1n_1,\n\\end{align}</math>\nimplying that <math>x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod {n_1}.</math> The second congruence is proved similarly.\n\n====General case====\nLet us consider a sequence of congruence equations:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align} \n  x &\\equiv a_1 \\pmod{n_1} \\\\ \n  &\\vdots              \\\\ \n  x &\\equiv a_k \\pmod{n_k},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the <math>n_i</math> are pairwise coprime. The two first equations have a solution <math>a_{1,2}</math> provided by the method of the previous section. The set of the solutions of these two first equations is the set of all solutions of the equation\n:<math>x \\equiv a_{1,2} \\pmod{n_1n_2}.</math>\n\nAs the other <math>n_i</math> are coprime with <math>n_1n_2,</math> this reduces solving the initial problem of {{mvar|k}} equations to a similar problem with <math>k-1</math> equations. Iterating the process, one gets eventually the solutions of the initial problem.\n\n===Existence (direct construction)===\nFor constructing a solution, it is not necessary to make an induction on the number of moduli. However, such a direct construction involves more computation with large numbers, which makes it less efficient and less used. Nevertheless, [[Lagrange interpolation]] is a special case of this construction, applied to polynomials instead of integers.\n\nLet <math>N_i = N/n_i</math> be the product of all moduli but one. As the <math>n_i</math> are pairwise coprime, <math>N_i</math> and <math>n_i</math> are coprime. Thus [[B\u00e9zout's identity]] applies, and there exist integers <math>M_i</math> and <math>m_i</math> such that\n:<math>M_iN_i + m_in_i=1.</math>\n\nA solution of the system of congruences is\n:<math>x=\\sum_{i=1}^k a_iM_iN_i.</math>\nIn fact, as <math>N_j</math> is a multiple of <math>n_i</math> for <math>i\\neq j,</math>\nwe have\n:<math>x \\equiv a_iM_iN_i \\equiv a_i(1-m_in_i) \\equiv a_i \\pmod{n_i}, </math>\nfor every <math>i.</math>\n\n==Computation==\nLet us consider a system of congruences:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align} \n x &\\equiv a_1  \\pmod{n_1} \\\\\n &\\vdots             \\\\ \n x &\\equiv a_k \\pmod{n_k}, \\\\ \n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the <math>n_i</math> are pairwise [[coprime]], and let <math>N=n_1 n_2\\cdots n_k.</math> In this section several methods are described for computing the unique solution for <math>x</math>, such that <math>0\\le x<N,</math> and these methods are applied on the example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n x &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n x &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n x &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Systematic search===\nIt is easy to check whether a value of {{mvar|x}} is a solution: it suffices to compute the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|x}} by each {{math|''n''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Thus, to find the solution, it suffices to check successively the integers from {{math|0}} to {{mvar|N}} until finding the solution.\n\nAlthough very simple this method is very inefficient: for the simple example considered here, {{math|40}} integers (including {{math|0}}) have to be checked for finding the solution {{math|39}}. This is an [[exponential time]] algorithm, as the size of the input is, up to a constant factor, the number of digits of {{mvar|N}}, and the average number of operations is of the order of {{mvar|N}}.\n\nTherefore, this method is rarely used, for hand-written computation as well on computers.\n\n===Search by sieving===\nThe search of the solution may be made dramatically faster by sieving. For this method, we suppose, without loss of generality, that <math>0\\le a_i <n_i</math> (if it were not the case, it would suffice to replace each <math>a_i</math> by the remainder of its division by <math>n_i</math>). This implies that the solution belongs to the [[arithmetic progression]]\n:<math>a_1, a_1 + n_1, a_1+2n_1, \\ldots</math>\nBy testing the values of these numbers modulo <math>n_2,</math> one eventually finds a solution <math>x_2</math> of the two first congruences. Then the solution belongs to the arithmetic progression \n:<math>x_2, x_2 + n_1n_2, x_2+2n_1n_2, \\ldots</math>\nTesting the values of these numbers modulo <math>n_3,</math>, and continuing until every modulus has been tested gives eventually the solution.\n\nThis method is faster if the moduli have been ordered by decreasing value, that is if <math>n_1>n_2> \\cdots > n_k.</math> For the example, this gives the following computation. We consider first the numbers that are congruent to 4 modulo 5 (the largest modulus), which are 4, {{nowrap|1=9 = 4 + 5}}, {{nowrap|1=14 = 9 + 5}}, ... For each of them, compute the remainder by 4 (the second largest modulus) until getting a number congruent to 3 modulo 4. Then one can proceed  by adding {{nowrap|1=20 = 5\u00d74}} at each step, and computing only the remainders by 3. This gives\n:4 mod 4 \u2192 0. Continue\n:4 + 5 = 9 mod 4 \u21921.  Continue\n:9 + 5 = 14 mod 4 \u2192 2. Continue\n:14 + 5 = 19 mod 4 \u2192 3. OK, continue by considering remainders modulo 3 and adding 5\u00d74 = 20 each time\n:19 mod 3 \u2192 1. Continue\n:19 + 20 = 39 mod 3 \u2192 0. OK, this is the result.\n\nThis method works well for hand-written computation with a product of moduli that is not too big. However, it is much slower than other methods, for very large products of moduli. Although dramatically faster than the systematic search, this method also has an [[exponential time]] complexity and is therefore not used on computers.\n\n===Using the existence construction===\nThe [[#Existence (constructive proof)|constructive existence proof]] shows that, in the [[#Case of two moduli|case of two moduli]], the solution may be obtained by the computation of the [[B\u00e9zout coefficients]] of the moduli, followed by a few multiplications, additions and reductions modulo <math>n_1n_2</math> (for getting a result in the interval <math>(0, n_1n_2-1)</math>). As the B\u00e9zout's coefficients may be computed with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]], the whole computation, at most, has a quadratic [[time complexity]] of <math>O((s_1+s_2)^2),</math> where <math>s_i</math> denotes the number of digits of <math>n_i.</math>\n\nFor more than two moduli, the method for two moduli allows the replacement of any two congruences by a single congruence modulo the product of the moduli. Iterating this process provides eventually the solution with a complexity, which is quadratic in the number of digits of the product of all moduli. This quadratic time complexity does not depend on the order in which the moduli are regrouped. One may regroup the two first moduli, then regroup the resulting modulus with the next one, and so on. This strategy is the easiest to implement, but it also requires more computation involving large numbers.\n\nAnother strategy consists in partitioning the moduli in pairs whose product have comparable sizes (as much as possible), applying, in parallel, the method of two moduli to each pair, and iterating with a number of moduli approximatively divided by two. This method allows an easy parallelization of the algorithm. Also, if fast algorithms (that is algorithms working in [[quasilinear time]]) are used for the basic operations, this method provides an algorithm for the whole computation that works in quasilinear time.\n\nOn the current example (which has only three moduli), both strategies are identical and work as follows.\n\n[[B\u00e9zout's identity]] for 3 and 4 is\n:<math>1\\times 4 + (-1)\\times 3 = 1.</math>\nPutting this in the formula given for proving the existence gives \n:<math>0\\times 4 + (-3)\\times 3 =-9</math>\nfor a solution of the two first congruences, the other solutions being obtained by adding to \u22129 any multiple of {{nowrap|1= 3\u00d74 = 12}}. One may continue with any of these solutions, but the solution {{nowrap|1=3 = \u22129 +12}} is smaller (in absolute value) and thus leads probably to an easier computation\n\nB\u00e9zout identity for 5 and 3\u00d74 = 12 is\n:<math>5\\times 5 +(-2)\\times 12 =1.</math>\nApplying the same formula again, we get a solution of the problem:\n:<math>25\\times 3 -24\\times 4 = -21.</math>\nThe other solutions are obtained by adding any multiple of {{nowrap|1=3\u00d74\u00d75 = 60}}, and the smallest positive solution is {{nowrap|1=\u221221 + 60 = 39}}.\n\n===As a linear Diophantine system===\nThe system of congruences solved by the Chinese remainder theorem may be rewritten as a [[Diophantine equation#System of linear Diophantine equations|system of simultaneous linear Diophantine equations]]:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align} \n x &= a_1 +x_1n_1\\\\ \n &\\vdots   \\\\ \n x &=a_k+x_kn_k, \n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the unknown integers are <math>x</math> and the <math>x_i.</math> Therefore, every general method for solving such systems may be used for finding the solution of Chinese remainder theorem, such as the reduction of the matrix of the system to [[Smith normal form]] or [[Hermite normal form]]. However, as usual when using a general algorithm for a more specific problem, this approach is less efficient than the method of the preceding section, based on a direct use of [[B\u00e9zout's identity]].\n\n==Over principal ideal domains==\nIn {{slink||Theorem statement}}, the Chinese remainder theorem has been stated in three different ways: in terms of remainders, of congruences, and of a ring isomorphism. The statement in terms of remainders does not apply, in general, to [[principal ideal domain]]s, as remainders are not defined in such rings. However, the two other versions make sense over a principal ideal domain {{math|''R''}}: it suffices to replace \"integer\" by \"element of the domain\" and <math>\\Bbb Z</math> by  {{math|''R''}}. These two versions of the theorem are true in this context, because the proofs (except for the first existence proof), are based on [[Euclid's lemma]] and [[B\u00e9zout's identity]], which are true over every principal domain.\n\nHowever, in general, the theorem is only an existence theorem and does not provide any way for computing the solution, unless one has an algorithm for computing the coefficients of B\u00e9zout's identity.\n\n==Over univariate polynomial rings and Euclidean domains==\nThe statement in terms of remainders given in {{slink||Theorem statement}} cannot be generalized to any principal ideal domain, but its generalization to [[Euclidean domain]]s is straightforward. The [[univariate polynomial]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] is the typical example of a Euclidean domain, which is not the integers. Therefore, we state the theorem for the case of a ring of univariate domain <math>R=K[X]</math> over a field <math>K.</math> For getting the theorem for a general Euclidean domain, it suffices to replace the degree by the [[Euclidean function]] of the Euclidean domain.\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is thus: Let <math>P_i(X)</math> (the moduli) be,  for {{math|1=''i''=1, ..., ''k''}}, [[pairwise coprime]] polynomials in <math>R=K[X]</math>. Let <math>d_i =\\deg P_i</math> be the degree of <math>P_i(X)</math>, and <math>D</math> be the sum of the <math>d_i.</math>\nIf <math>A_i(X), \\ldots,A_k(X)</math> are polynomials such that <math>A_i(X)=0</math> or <math>\\deg A_i<d_i</math> for every {{math|''i''}}, then, there is one and only one polynomial <math>P(X)</math>, such that <math>\\deg P<D</math> and the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of <math>P(X)</math> by <math>P_i(X)</math> is <math>A_i(X)</math> for every {{math|''i''}}.\n\nThe construction of the solution may be done as in {{slink||Existence (constructive proof)}} or {{slink||Existence (direct proof)}}. However, the latter construction may be simplified by using, as follows, [[partial fraction decomposition]] instead of [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].\n\nThus, we want to find a polynomial <math>P(X)</math>, which satisfies the congruences\n:<math>P(X)\\equiv A_i(X) \\pmod {P_i(X)},</math>\nfor <math>i=1,\\ldots,k.</math>\n\nLet us consider the polynomials\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    Q(X) &= \\prod_{i=1}^{k}P_i(X) \\\\\n  Q_i(X) &= \\frac{Q(X)}{P_i(X)}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe partial fraction decomposition of <math>1/Q(X)</math> gives {{mvar|k}} polynomials <math>S_i(X)</math> with degrees <math>\\deg S_i(X) < d_i,</math> such that\n:<math>\\frac{1}{Q(X)} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{S_i(X)}{P_i(X)},</math>\nand thus\n:<math>1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}S_i(X) Q_i(X).</math>\n\nThen a solution of the simultaneous congruence system is given by the polynomial\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^k A_i(X) S_i(X) Q_i(X).</math>\n\nIn fact, we have\n: <math>\\sum_{i=1}^k A_i(X) S_i(X) Q_i(X)= A_i(X)+ \\sum_{j=1}^{k}(A_j(X) - A_i(X)) S_j(X) Q_j(X) \\equiv A_i(X)\\pmod{P_i(X)},</math>\nfor <math>1 \\leq i \\leq k.</math>\n\nThis solution may have a degree larger that <math>D=\\sum_{i=1}^k d_i.</math> The unique solution of degree less than <math>D</math> may be deduced by considering the remainder <math>B_i(X)</math> of the Euclidean division of <math>A_i(X)S_i(X)</math> by <math>P_i(X).</math> This solution is \n:<math>P(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^k B_i(X) Q_i(X).</math>\n\n===Lagrange interpolation===\nA special case of Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials is [[Lagrange interpolation]]. For this, let us consider {{mvar|k}} [[monic polynomial]]s of degree one:\n\n:<math>P_i(X)=X-x_i.</math>\n\nThey are pairwise coprime if the <math>x_i</math> are all different. The remainder of the division by <math>P_i(X)</math> of a polynomial <math>P(X)</math> is <math>P(x_i).</math>\n\nNow, let <math>A_1, \\ldots, A_k</math> be constants (polynomials of degree 0) in <math>K.</math> Both Lagrange interpolation and Chinese remainder theorem assert the existence of a unique polynomial <math>P(X),</math> of degree less than <math>k</math> such that\n\n:<math>P(x_i)=A_i,</math>\n\nfor every <math>i.</math>\n\nLagrange interpolation formula is exactly the result, in this case, of the above construction of the solution. More precisely, let \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  Q(X)  &= \\prod_{i=1}^{k}(X-x_i) \\\\[6pt]\n Q_i(X) &= \\frac{Q(X)}{X-x_i}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe [[partial fraction decomposition]] of <math>\\frac{1}{Q(X)}</math> is \n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{Q(X)} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{Q_i(x_i)(X-X_i)}.</math>\n\nIn fact, reducing the right-hand side to a common denominator one gets \n\n:<math> \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{Q_i(x_i)(X-X_i)}= \\frac{1}{Q(X)} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{Q_i(X)}{Q_i(x_i)},</math>\n\nand the numerator is equal to one, as being a polynomial of degree less than <math>k,</math> which takes the value one for <math>k</math> different values of <math>X.</math>\n\nUsing the above general formula, we get the Lagrange interpolation formula:\n\n:<math>P(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^k A_i\\frac{Q_i(X)}{Q_i(x_i)}.</math>\n\n===Hermite interpolation===\n[[Hermite interpolation]] is an application of Chinese remainder theorem for univariate polynomials, which may involve moduli of arbitrary degrees (Lagrange interpolation involves only moduli of degree one).\n\nThe problem consists of finding a polynomial of the least possible degree, such that the polynomial and its first derivatives take given values at some fixed points.\n\nMore precisely, let <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_k</math> be <math>k</math> elements of the ground [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>K,</math> and, for <math>i=1,\\ldots, k,</math> let <math>a_{i,0}, a_{i,1}, \\ldots, a_{i,r_i-1}</math> be the values of the first <math>r_i</math> derivatives of the sought polynomial at <math>x_i</math> (including the 0th derivative, which is the value of the polynomial itself). The problem is to find a polynomial <math>P(X)</math> such that its ''j''th derivative takes the value <math>a_{i,j} </math> at <math>x_i,</math> for <math>i=1,\\ldots,k</math> and <math>j=0,\\ldots,r_j.</math>\n\nLet us consider the polynomial\n:<math>P_i(X) = \\sum_{j=0}^{r_i - 1}\\frac{a_{i,j}}{j!}(X - x_i)^j.</math>\nThis is the Taylor polynomial   of order <math>r_i-1</math> at <math>x_i</math>, of the unknown polynomial <math>P(X).</math> Therefore, we must have\n:<math>P(X)\\equiv P_i(X) \\pmod {(X-x_i)^{r_i}}.</math>\n\nConversely, any polynomial <math>P(X) </math> that satisfies these <math>k</math> congruences, in particular verifies, for any <math>i=1, \\ldots, k</math>\n:<math>P(X)= P_i(X) +o(X-x_i)^{r_i-1} </math> \ntherefore <math>P_i(X)</math> is its Taylor polynomial of order <math> r_i - 1</math> at <math>x_i</math>, that is, <math>P(X)</math> solves the initial Hermite interpolation problem.\nThe Chinese remainder theorem asserts that there exists exactly one polynomial of degree less than the sum of the <math>r_i,</math> which satisfies these <math>k</math> congruences.\n\nThere are several ways for computing the solution <math>P(X).</math> One may use the method described at the beginning of {{slink||Over univariate polynomial rings and Euclidean domains}}. One may also use the constructions given in {{slink||Existence (constructive proof)}} or {{slink||Existence (direct proof)}}.\n\n==Generalization to non-coprime moduli==\nThe Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to non-coprime moduli. Let <math>m, n, a, b</math> be any integers, let <math>g = \\gcd(m,n)</math>, and consider the system of congruences:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx &\\equiv a \\pmod {m} \\\\\nx &\\equiv b \\pmod {n},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nIf <math>a \\equiv b \\pmod g</math>, then this system of equations has a unique solution modulo <math>\\operatorname{lcm}(m,n) = mn/g</math>. Otherwise, it has no solutions.\n\nIf we use [[B\u00e9zout's identity]] to write <math>g = um + vn</math>, then the solution is\n:<math> x = \\frac{avn+bum}{g}.</math>\nThis defines an integer, as {{mvar|g}} divides both {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}. Otherwise, the proof is very similar to that for coprime moduli.\n\n==Generalization to arbitrary rings==\nThe Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], by using [[Coprime integers#Coprimality in ring ideals|coprime ideal]]s (also called [[Ideal (ring theory)#Types of ideals|comaximal ideals]]). Two ideals {{mvar|I}} and {{mvar|J}} are coprime if there are elements <math>i\\in I</math> and <math>j\\in J</math> such that <math>i+j=1.</math> This relation plays the role of [[B\u00e9zout's identity]] in the proofs related to this generalization, which, otherwise are very similar. The generalization may be stated as follows.<ref>{{harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|page=181}}</ref>\n\nLet {{math|''I''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''I<sub>k</sub>''}} be [[two-sided ideal]]s of a ring <math>R</math> that are pairwise coprime,  and {{math|''I''}} be their intersection. Then we have the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]: \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    R/I &\\to R/I_1 \\times \\cdots \\times R/I_k \\\\\n  x\\ \\operatorname{mod} I &\\mapsto (x\\ \\operatorname{mod} I_1,\\, \\ldots,\\, x\\ \\operatorname{mod} I_k),\n\\end{align}</math>\nbetween the [[quotient ring]] <math>R/I</math> and the [[direct product of rings|direct product]] of the <math>R/I_i,</math>\nwhere \"<math>x \\operatorname{mod} I</math>\" denotes the image of the element <math>x</math> in the quotient ring defined by the ideal <math>I.</math>\nMoreover, if <math>R</math> is [[commutative ring|commutative]], then the ideal intersection {{math|''I''}} is equal to the [[product of ideals|product of the ideals]] <math>I_i:</math>\n:<math>\nI= I_1\\cap I_2 \\cap\\cdots\\cap I_k= I_1I_2\\cdots I_k.\n</math>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Sequence numbering===\nThe Chinese remainder theorem has been used to construct a [[G\u00f6del numbering for sequences]], which is involved in the proof of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]].\n\n===Fast Fourier transform===\nThe [[prime-factor FFT algorithm]] (also called Good-Thomas algorithm) uses the Chinese remainder theorem for reducing the computation of a [[fast Fourier transform]] of size <math>n_1n_2</math> to the computation of two fast Fourier transforms of smaller sizes <math>n_1</math> and <math>n_2</math> (providing that <math>n_1</math> and <math>n_2</math> are coprime).\n\n===Encryption===\nMost [[RSA (cryptosystem)#Using the Chinese remainder algorithm|implementations of RSA use the Chinese remainder theorem]] during signing of [[HTTPS]] certificates and during decryption.\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in [[secret sharing]], which consists of distributing a set of shares among a group of people who, all together (but no one alone), can recover a certain secret from the given set of shares. Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered. [[Secret sharing using the Chinese remainder theorem]] uses, along with the Chinese remainder theorem, special sequences of integers that guarantee the impossibility of recovering the secret from a set of shares with less than a certain [[cardinality]].\n\n===Range ambiguity resolution===\n{{main article | range ambiguity resolution }}\n\nThe [[range ambiguity resolution]] techniques used with [[medium pulse repetition frequency]] radar can be seen as a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem.\n\n===Dedekind's theorem===\n'''Dedekind's theorem on the linear independence of characters.''' Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[monoid]] and {{mvar|k}} an [[integral domain]], viewed as a monoid by considering the multiplication on {{mvar|k}}. Then any finite family {{math|(&nbsp;''f<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>}} of distinct monoid homomorphisms {{math|&nbsp;''f<sub>i</sub>'' : ''M'' \u2192 ''k''}} is linearly independent. In other words, every family {{math|(''\u03b1<sub>i</sub>'')<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>}} of elements {{math|''\u03b1<sub>i</sub>'' \u2208 ''k''}} satisfying \n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I}\\alpha_i f_i = 0</math>\n\nmust be equal to the family {{math|(0)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>}}.\n\n'''Proof.''' First assume that {{mvar|k}} is a field, otherwise, replace the integral domain {{mvar|k}} by its quotient field, and nothing will change. We can linearly extend the monoid homomorphisms {{math|&nbsp;''f<sub>i</sub>'' : ''M'' \u2192 ''k''}} to {{mvar|k}}-algebra homomorphisms {{math|''F<sub>i</sub>'' : ''k''[''M''] \u2192 ''k''}}, where {{math|''k''[''M'']}} is the [[monoid ring]] of {{mvar|M}} over {{mvar|k}}. Then, by linearity, the condition\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}\\alpha_i f_i = 0,</math>\n\nyields\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I}\\alpha_i F_i = 0.</math>\n\nNext, for {{math|''i'', ''j'' \u2208 ''I''; ''i'' \u2260 ''j''}} the two {{mvar|k}}-linear maps {{math|''F<sub>i</sub>'' : ''k''[''M''] \u2192 ''k''}} and {{math|''F<sub>j</sub>'' : ''k''[''M''] \u2192 ''k''}} are not proportional to each other. Otherwise {{math|&nbsp;''f<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;}} and {{math|&nbsp;''f<sub>j</sub>''&nbsp;}} would also be proportional, and thus equal since as monoid homomorphisms they satisfy: {{math|&nbsp;''f<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;(1) {{=}} 1 {{=}} &nbsp;''f<sub>j</sub>''&nbsp;(1)}}, which contradicts the assumption that they are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the kernels {{math|Ker ''F<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|Ker ''F<sub>j</sub>''}} are distinct. Since {{math|''k''[''M'']/Ker ''F<sub>i</sub>'' \u2245 ''F<sub>i</sub>''(''k''[''M'']) {{=}} ''k''}} is a field, {{math|Ker ''F<sub>i</sub>''}} is a maximal ideal of {{math|''k''[''M'']}} for every {{math|''i'' \u2208 ''I''}}. Because they are distinct and maximal the ideals {{math|Ker ''F<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|Ker ''F<sub>j</sub>''}} are coprime whenever {{math|''i'' \u2260 ''j''}}. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (for general rings) yields an isomorphism:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\phi: k[M] / K &\\to \\prod_{i \\in I}k[M] / \\mathrm{Ker} F_i \\\\\n     \\phi(x + K) &= \\left(x + \\mathrm{Ker} F_i\\right)_{i \\in I}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>K = \\prod_{i \\in I}\\mathrm{Ker} F_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I}\\mathrm{Ker} F_i.</math>\n\nConsequently, the map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\Phi: k[M] &\\to \\prod_{i \\in I}k[M]/ \\mathrm{Ker} F_i \\\\\n     \\Phi(x) &= \\left(x + \\mathrm{Ker} F_i\\right)_{i \\in I}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nis surjective. Under the isomorphisms {{math|''k''[''M'']/Ker ''F<sub>i</sub>'' \u2192 ''F<sub>i</sub>''(''k''[''M'']) {{=}} ''k'',}} the map {{math|\u03a6}} corresponds to:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\psi: k[M] &\\to \\prod_{i \\in I}k \\\\\n     \\psi(x) &= \\left[F_i(x)\\right]_{i \\in I}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow,\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I}\\alpha_i F_i = 0</math>\n\nyields\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I}\\alpha_i u_i = 0</math>\n\nfor every vector {{math|(''u<sub>i</sub>'')<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>}} in the image of the map {{mvar|\u03c8}}. Since {{mvar|\u03c8}} is surjective, this means that\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I}\\alpha_i u_i = 0</math>\n\nfor every vector\n:<math>\\left(u_i\\right)_{i \\in I} \\in \\prod_{i \\in I}k.</math>\n\nConsequently, {{math|(''\u03b1<sub>i</sub>'')<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> {{=}} (0)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>}}.

Upon his discharge, he returned to finish his education, which had been interrupted by the war, at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name=\"strangehorizons.com\"/> While living in Chicago he also worked at Trans-Radio Press, a news wire service. In 1951 he started writing full-time,<ref name=Platt>[[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]], \"C. M. Kornbluth: A Study Of His Work and Interview With His Widow\", ''[[Foundation (journal)|Foundation]]'' 17, September 1979, pp.57-63</ref> returning to the East Coast where he collaborated on novels with his old Futurian friends Frederik Pohl and [[Judith Merril]].\n\n==Work==\nKornbluth began writing at 15. His first solo story, \"The Rocket of 1955\", was published in [[Richard Wilson (author)|Richard Wilson]]'s [[fanzine]] ''Escape'' (Vol. 1, No 2, August 1939); his first collaboration, \"Stepsons of Mars,\" written with Richard Wilson and published under the name \"Ivar Towers\", appeared in the April 1940 ''[[Astonishing Stories|Astonishing]]''. His other short fiction includes \"[[The Little Black Bag]]\", \"[[The Marching Morons]]\", \"The Altar at Midnight\", \"MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie\", \"Gomez\" and \"The Advent on Channel 12\".\n\n\"The Little Black Bag\" was first adapted for television live on the television show ''Tales of Tomorrow'' on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the [[BBC]] in 1969 for its ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'' series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by [[Rod Serling]] for an episode of his ''[[Night Gallery]]'' series. This dramatization starred [[Burgess Meredith]] as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctor's license and become a homeless alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future (2098), which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently.\n\n\"[[The Marching Morons]]\" is a look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses&nbsp;\u2013 the precarious minority of the \"elite\" working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. In his introduction to ''The Best of C.M. Kornbluth'', Pohl states that \"The Marching Morons\" is a direct sequel to \"The Little Black Bag\": it is easy to miss this, as \"Bag\" is set in the contemporary present while \"Morons\" takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of \"The Marching Morons\": a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to \"play doctor\". A future Earth similar to \"The Marching Morons\"&nbsp;\u2013 a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses&nbsp;\u2013 is used again in the final stages of Kornbluth & Pohl's ''Search the Sky''.<ref name= \"Best\">{{cite book |last= Rich |first= Mark |chapter= ''The Best of C.

M. Kornbluth'' ([[NESFA Press]], 1997).\n\n==Personality and habits==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n\nFrederik Pohl, in his autobiography ''The Way the Future Was'', [[Damon Knight]], in his memoir ''The Futurians'', and [[Isaac Asimov]], in his memoirs ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' and ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'', all give descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and eccentricities.\n\nKornbluth, for example, decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories, in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ''[[ballista]]'', an Ancient Roman weapon, Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the 'A's and had started on the 'B's.\n\nAccording to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.\n\nKornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were \"supposed to\" drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually \"weaned himself\" (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''[[Outpost Mars]]'' (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as [[Cyril Judd]]), first published as a ''[[Galaxy science fiction|Galaxy]]'' serial entitled ''Mars Child'' (May\u2013July 1951) and later reprinted as ''Galaxy novel'' No. 46 retitled ''Sin in Space'' (1961)\n* ''[[Gunner Cade]]'' (1952) (with Judith Merril, writing as [[Cyril Judd]]), first published as an ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' serial (March\u2013May 1952)\n* ''Takeoff'' (May 1952), later serialised in ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' (April\u2013June 1954)\n* ''[[The Space Merchants]]'' (April 1953) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a ''[[Galaxy science fiction|Galaxy]]'' serial entitled ''Gravy Planet'' (June\u2013August 1952)\n* ''[[The Syndic]]'' (October 1953), later serialised in ''[[Science Fiction Adventures (1952 magazine)|Science Fiction Adventures]]'' (December 1953-March 1954), entered the [[Prometheus Award]] Hall of Fame in 1986\n* ''[[Search the Sky]]'' (February 1954) (with Frederik Pohl), later revised by Pohl (October 1985)\n* ''[[Gladiator at Law]]'' (May 1955) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a ''[[Galaxy science fiction|Galaxy]]'' serial (June\u2013August 1954), later revised by Pohl (April 1986)\n* ''[[Not This August]]'' (July 1955) (AKA ''Christmas Eve''), later revised by Pohl (December 1981)\n* ''[[Wolfbane (novel)|Wolfbane]]'' (September 1959) (with Frederik Pohl), first published as a ''[[Galaxy science fiction|Galaxy]]'' serial (October\u2013November 1957), later revised by Pohl (June 1986)\n\n===Collections===\n* ''[[The Explorers (collection)|The Explorers]]'' (1954)\n** \"Foreword\", [Frederik Pohl]\n** \"Gomez\", [original here]\n** \"The Mindworm\", 1950\n** \"The Rocket of 1955\", 1939\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1952-11/Galaxy_1952_11#page/n95/mode/2up The Altar at Midnight]\", 1952\n** \"Thirteen O\u2019Clock\" [as by Cecil Corwin], (1941) \"Peter Packer\" series\n** \"The Goodly Creatures\", 1952\n** \"[https://archive.org/stream/10_Story_Fantasy_v01n01_1951-Spring_Tawrast-EXciter#page/n25/mode/2up Friend to Man]\", 1951\n** \"With These Hands\", 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory\", 1962\n* ''The Mindworm and Other Stories'' (1955)\n** \"The Mindworm\u201d, (1950)\n** \"Gomez\u201d, 1954\n** \"The Rocket of 1955\u201d, 1939\n** \"The Altar at Midnight\u201d, 1952\n** \"The Little Black Bag\u201d, 1950\n** \"The Goodly Creatures\u201d, 1952\n** \"Friend to Man\u201d, 1951\n** \"With These Hands\u201d, 1951\n** \"That Share of Glory\u201d, 1952\n** \"The Luckiest Man in Denv\" [as by Simon Eisner], \u00b7 1952\n** \"The Silly Season\u201d, 1950\n** \"The Marching Morons \u00b7 nv ''Galaxy'' Apr \u201951\n* ''[[A Mile Beyond the Moon]]'' (1958) [abridged for its 1962 paperback reprint, see below]\n** \"Make Mine Mars\u201d, 1952\n** \"The Meddlers\u201d, 1953 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"The Events Leading Down to the Tragedy\u201d, 1958\n** \"The Little Black Bag\u201d, 1950 (related to \"The Marching Morons\")\n** \"Everybody Knows Joe\u201d, 1953\n** \"Time Bum\u201d, 1953\n** \"Passion Pills\u201d, [original here] [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Virginia\u201d, 1958\n** \"The Slave\u201d, 1957 [not in 1962 paperback]\n** \"Kazam Collects\" [as by S.

Animals in these species reingest their cecotropes, to extract further nutrients. Cecotropes derive from chewed plant material that collects in the [[cecum]], a chamber between the large and small intestine, containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. After [[egestion|excretion]] of the soft [[cecotrope]],  it is again eaten whole by the animal and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables these animals to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrients are derived from the food they eat.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard | year = 2007}}</ref> This process serves the same purpose within these animals as [[ruminant|rumination]] (cud-chewing) does in cattle and sheep.<ref>''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R.

L. Moore'''. She was among the first women to write in the science fiction and fantasy genres, though earlier woman writers in these genres include [[Clare Winger Harris]], [[Greye La Spina]], and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett|Francis Stevens]], amongst others. Nevertheless, Moore's work paved the way for many other female [[speculative fiction]] writers.\n\nMoore married her first husband [[Henry Kuttner]] in 1940, and most of her work from 1940-1958 (Kuttner's death) was written by the couple collaboratively.  They were prolific co-authors under their own names, although more often under any one of several [[pseudonym]]s.\n\nAs \"Catherine Kuttner\", she had a brief career as a television scriptwriter from 1958 to 1962.  She retired from writing in 1963.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early life===\nMoore was born on January 24, 1911 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. She was chronically ill as a child and spent much of her time reading literature of the fantastic. She left college during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] to work as a secretary at the [[Fletcher Trust Building|Fletcher Trust Company]] in Indianapolis.\n\n===Writing career===\n''The Vagabond'', a student-run magazine at Indiana University, published three of her stories when she was a student there.  The three short stories, all with a fantasy theme and all credited to \"Catherine Moore\", appeared in 1930/31.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/many-names-catherine-lucille-moore/ The Many Names of Catherine Lucille Moore]</ref>  Her first professional sales appeared in [[pulp magazines]] beginning in 1933.  Her decision to publish under the name \"C.L. Moore\" stemmed not from a desire to hide her gender, but to keep her employers at Fletcher Trust from knowing that she was working as a writer on the side.\n\nHer early work included two significant series in ''[[Weird Tales]]'', then edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]].  One features the rogue and adventurer [[Northwest Smith]] wandering through the [[Solar System]]; the other features the swordswoman/warrior [[Jirel of Joiry]], one of the first female protagonists in [[sword-and-sorcery]] fiction. Both series are sometimes named for their lead characters.<ref name=isfdb/> One of the Northwest Smith stories, \"Nymph of Darkness\" (''Fantasy Magazine'' (April 1935); expurgated version, ''Weird Tales'' (Dec 1939)), was written in collaboration with [[Forrest J Ackerman]].<ref>Forrest J. Ackerman, ''Ackermanthology: 65 Aston\u00edshing, Rediscovered SF Shorts''.  LA: General Publishing Co, 1997, pp. 255-270.</ref>\n\nThe most famous Northwest Smith story is \"[[Shambleau]]\", which was also Moore's first professional sale. It originally appeared in the November 1933 issue of ''Weird Tales'',<ref name=isfdb/> netting her $100, and later becoming a popular anthology reprint.[[File:Weird Tales October 1934.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''Weird Tales'', October 1934, featuring \"The Black God's Kiss\" by Moore (painting by [[Margaret Brundage]])]] Her most famous Jirel story is also the first one, \"Black God's Kiss\", which was the cover story in the October 1934 issue of ''Weird Tales'', subtitled \"the weirdest story ever told\" (see figure).<ref name=isfdb/> Moore's early stories were notable for their emphasis on the senses and emotions, which was unusual in genre fiction at the time.\n\nMoore's work also appeared in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine throughout the 1940s. Several stories written for that magazine were later collected in her first published book, ''[[Judgment Night (collection)|Judgment Night]]'' (1952)<ref>{{cite book|author=Moore, C.L.|publisher=[[Gnome Press]]|date= 1952|title=Judgment Night}}</ref><ref name=isfdb/>{{efn|In 1951 Gnome had published ''Tomorrow and Tomorrow and the Fairy Chessmen'', the omnibus edition of two short novels by Moore & Kuttner as Lewis Padgett, which had been two-part serials in ''Astounding'' during 1947 and 1946. ''Judgment Night'' comprised five stories by Moore alone\u2014none from the Northwest Smith and Jirel series, which Gnome collected in part one year later.<ref name=isfdb/>}} One of them, the novella \"No Woman Born\" (1944), was to be included in more than 10 different science fiction anthologies including ''The Best of C. L. Moore''.<ref>{{isfdb title |47580 |No Woman Born}} ('''ISFDB'''). Retrieved 2012-04-20.</ref>\n\nIncluded in that collection were \"Judgment Night\" (first published in August and September 1943), the lush rendering of a future [[galactic empire]] with a sober meditation on the nature of power and its inevitable loss; \"The Code\" (July 1945), an homage to the classic [[Faust]] with modern theories and [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] dread; \"Promised Land\" (February 1950) and \"Heir Apparent\" (July 1950), both documenting the grim twisting that mankind must undergo in order to spread into the Solar System; and \"Paradise Street\" (September 1950), a futuristic take on the [[American Old West|Old West]] conflict between lone hunter and wilderness-taming settlers.\n\n===Marriage to Henry Kuttner and literary collaborations===\n\nMoore met [[Henry Kuttner]], also a science fiction writer, in 1936 when he wrote her a fan letter under the impression that \"C. L. Moore\" was a man. They soon collaborated on a story that combined Moore's signature characters, Northwest Smith and Jirel of Joiry: \"Quest of the Starstone\" (1937).\n\nMoore and Kuttner married in 1940 and thereafter wrote many of their stories in collaboration, sometimes under their own names, but more often using the joint pseudonyms C. H. Liddell, Lawrence O'Donnell, or Lewis Padgett \u2014 [[Lewis Padgett#Bibliography|most commonly the latter]], a combination of their mothers' maiden names.  Moore still occasionally wrote solo work during this period, including the frequently anthologized \"No Woman Born\" (1944).   A selection of Moore's solo short fiction work from 1942 through 1950 was collected in 1952's ''Judgement Night''.  Moore's only solo novel, ''Doomsday Morning'' appeared in 1957.\n\nThe vast majority of Moore's work in the period, though, was written as part of a very prolific partnership. Working together, the couple managed to combine Moore's style with Kuttner's more cerebral storytelling. They continued to work in sf and fantasy, and their works include two frequently anthologized sf classics: \"[[Mimsy Were the Borogoves]]\" (February 1943), the basis for the film ''[[The Last Mimzy]]'' (2007), and \"[[Vintage Season]]\" (September 1946), the basis for the film ''[[Timescape (1992 film)|Timescape]]'' (1992).  As \"Lewis Padgett\" they also penned two mystery novels: ''The Brass Ring'' (1946) and ''The Day He Died'' (1947).\n\n===Career after Kuttner's death===\n\nAfter Kuttner's death in 1958, Moore continued teaching her writing course at the [[University of Southern California]] but permanently retired from writing any further literary fiction.  Instead, working as \"Catherine Kuttner\", she carved out a short-lived career as a scriptwriter for [[Warner Brothers]] television, writing episodes of the westerns ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', and ''[[The Alaskans]]'', as well as the detective series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', all between 1958 and 1962.  However, upon marrying Thomas Reggie (who was not a writer) in 1963, she ceased writing entirely.\n\nMoore was the author guest of honor at [[Kansas City, MO]]'s fantasy and science fiction convention [[ConQuesT|BYOB-Con 6]], held over the U. S. [[Memorial Day]] weekend in May, 1976.\n\nIn 1981, Moore received two annual awards for her career in fantasy literature: the [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]], chosen by a panel of judges at the [[World Fantasy Convention]], and the [[Gandalf Grand Master Award]], chosen by vote of participants in the [[World Science Fiction Convention]].<ref name=SFAwards/> (Thus she became the eighth and final Grand Master of Fantasy, sponsored by the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]], in partial analogy to the Grand Master of Science Fiction sponsored by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]].)\n\nMoore was an active member of the Tom and Terri Pinckard Science Fiction literary salon and a frequent contributor to literary discussions with the regular membership, including [[Robert Bloch]], [[George Clayton Johnson]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Norman Spinrad]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], and others, as well as many visiting writers and speakers.\n\n===Later life===\nShe developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] but that was not obvious for several years. She had ceased to attend the meetings when{{when|date=March 2013}} she was nominated to be the first woman [[SFWA Grand Master|Grand Master]] of the Science Fiction Writers of America; the nomination was withdrawn at the request of her husband, Thomas Reggie, who said the award and ceremony would be at best confusing and likely upsetting to her, given the progress of her disease.{{Citation needed|reason=The footnote at the end of the paragraph is about Gene Wolfe's nomination and does not mention Moore or her husband|date=March 2014}} That caused dismay among the former SFWA presidents, for she was a great favorite to receive the award.{{clarify|date=March 2013|reason=does this mean a betting favorite, expected to be the next Grand Master? perhaps the source is clear. what is it?}} (Former presidents and current officers select a living writer as Grand Master of SF, no more than one annually.)<ref name=SFWA/>\n\n===Death===\nMoore died on April 4, 1987 at her home in [[Hollywood, California]] after a long battle with Alzheimer's.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/many-names-catherine-lucille-moore/|title=The Many Names of Catherine Lucille Moore {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|newspaper=Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Moore in 1998, its third class of two deceased and two living writers.<ref name=sfhof-old/>\n\n== Selected works ==\n[[File:Fantastic Novels cover July 1950.JPG|thumb|185px|''[[Earth's Last Citadel]]'' was reprinted in the July 1950 edition of ''[[Fantastic Novels]]''.]]\n* ''[[Earth's Last Citadel]]'' (with [[Henry Kuttner]]; 1943)\n* \"[[Vintage Season]]\" (novella written with [[Henry Kuttner]], as \"[[Lawrence O'Donnell]]\"; 1946).

They were designed to compete with early transistor electronics and were used in [[television]]s, [[radio]]s, and similar roles.\n\n== History ==\nThe '''Compactron''' was a trade name applied to multi-electrode structure tubes specifically constructed on a 12-pin Duodecar base. This [[vacuum tube]] family was introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicdesign.com/4g/multi-function-compactrons-promise-two-tube-radio |title=Multi-Function Compactrons Promise Two-Tube Radio |publisher=Electronic Design |page=74 |date=July 20, 1960 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/CompactronTubesIndex.shtml  |title=Compactron Tubes: A Junkbox Guide |publisher=Copperwood Media LLC. |first=Jeff |last=Duntemann |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> [[Television]] sets were a primary application. The idea of multi-electrode tubes itself was far from new and indeed the Loewe company of Germany was producing multi-electrode tubes as far back as 1926, and they even included all of the required passive components as well.<ref>https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html</ref>\n\nUse was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric [[Porta-Color]], was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons. Even before the compactron design was unveiled, nearly all tube based electronic equipment used multi-electrode tubes of one type or another. Virtually every AM/FM radio receiver of the 1950's and 60's used a 6AK8 (EABC80) tube (or equivalent) consisting of three diodes and a triode which was designed in 1954.<ref>http://www.r-type.org/exhib/abc0014.htm</ref>\n\nCompactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche.\n\n== Notable features ==\n[[Image:Duodekar.JPG|thumb|right|The evacuation tip is in the center of the circular pin pattern.]]\nA distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with \"miniature\" tubes, and a characteristic 3/4\" diameter circle pin pattern.\n* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1{{fraction|1|8}}\" to 2{{fraction|3|4}}\" depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of Compactrons type types include:\n*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6ag11.html 6AG11] double diode similar to 6AL5, double triode high-mu similar to [[12AT7]].

Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.\n\n== Technological obsolescence ==\n{{Original research|section|date=July 2016}}Integrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. \"Hybrid\" television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. [[New old stock]] replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n\n[[Category:Vacuum tubes]]", "sha1": "hv4abx4333rtlbzbt02m1ljxgbsaxot"}}, {"title": "Carmichael number", "ns": "0", "id": "7723", "revision": {"id": "866233216", "parentid": "866199645", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T03:18:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Anita5192", "id": "13220696"}, "comment": "/* Discovery */ Unlinked V\u00e1clav \u0160imerka:  article does not exist.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In [[number theory]], a '''Carmichael number''' is a [[composite number]] <math>n</math> which satisfies the [[modular arithmetic]] congruence relation:\n:<math>b^{n-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{n}</math>\nfor all integers <math>b</math> which are [[relatively prime]] to <math>n</math>.\n<ref>{{cite book | last=Riesel | first=Hans | title=Prime Numbers and Computer Methods for Factorization \n| publisher=Birkh\u00e4user | location=Boston, MA | edition=second | year=1994 | isbn=0-8176-3743-5 \n| zbl=0821.11001 | series=Progress in Mathematics | volume=126 |author-link=Hans Riesel }}</ref>\nThey are named for [[Robert Daniel Carmichael|Robert Carmichael]].\nThe Carmichael numbers are the subset ''K''<sub>1</sub> of the [[Kn\u00f6del number]]s.\n\nEquivalently, a Carmichael number is a composite number <math>n</math> for which\n:<math>b^n\\equiv b\\pmod{n}</math>\nfor all integers <math>b</math>.\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crandall|first1=Richard |last2=Pomerance |first2=Carl |date=2005 |title=Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective |edition=second |location=New York |publisher=Springer |page=133 |isbn=978-0387-25282-7 |author-link1=Richard Crandall |author-link2=Carl Pomerance }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[Fermat's little theorem]] states that if ''p'' is a [[prime number]], then for any [[integer]] ''b'', the number ''b''<sup>&nbsp;''p''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''b'' is an integer multiple of ''p''.  Carmichael numbers are composite numbers which have this property.  Carmichael numbers are also called [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s or '''absolute Fermat pseudoprimes'''. A Carmichael number will pass a [[Fermat primality test]] to every base ''b'' relatively prime to the number, even though it is not actually prime.\nThis makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem less effective than [[strong pseudoprime|strong probable prime]] tests such as the [[Baillie-PSW primality test]] and the [[Miller\u2013Rabin primality test]].\n\nHowever, no Carmichael number is either an [[Euler pseudoprime|Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime]] or a [[strong pseudoprime]] to every base relatively prime to it\n<ref>{{cite journal |author=D.

Therefore, no Carmichael number is a strong pseudoprime to every base relatively prime to it.</ref>\nso, in theory, either an Euler or a strong probable prime test could prove that a Carmichael number is, in fact, composite.\n\nAs numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become increasingly rare.

(The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that <math>-1</math> is a [[Fermat primality test|Fermat witness]] for any even composite number.)\nFrom the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are [[Cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic]].<ref>[http://www.numericana.com/data/crump.htm Carmichael Multiples of Odd Cyclic Numbers] \"Any divisor of a Carmichael number must be an odd cyclic number\"</ref><ref>Proof sketch: If <math>n</math> is square-free but not cyclic, <math>p_i \\mid p_j - 1</math> for two prime factors <math>p_i</math> and <math>p_j</math> of <math>n</math>.

Comp. |volume=37 |pages=587\u2013593|jstor=2007448 |doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-1981-0628717-0}}</ref> sharpened Erd\u0151s' heuristic arguments to conjecture that there are\n\n:<math>X^{1-{\\frac{\\{1+o(1)\\}\\log\\log\\log X}{\\log\\log X}}}</math>\n\nCarmichael numbers up to ''X''. However, inside current computational ranges (such as the counts of Carmichael numbers performed by Pinch<ref name=\"Pinch2007\"/> up to 10<sup>21</sup>), these conjectures are not yet borne out by the data.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe notion of Carmichael number generalizes to a Carmichael ideal in any number field ''K''. For any nonzero prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak p</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, we have <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak p}</math> for all <math>\\alpha</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak p</math>. (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that <math>m^p \\equiv m \\bmod p</math> for all integers ''m'' when ''p'' is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math> Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak a}</math> for all <math>\\alpha \\in {\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math>.  When ''K'' is <math>\\mathbf Q</math>, the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is principal, and if we let ''a'' be its positive generator then the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a = (a)</math> is Carmichael exactly when ''a'' is a Carmichael number in the usual sense.\n\nWhen ''K'' is larger than the rationals it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>: for any prime number ''p'' that splits completely in ''K'', the principal ideal <math>p{\\mathcal O}_K</math> is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>. For example, if ''p'' is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal (''p'') in the Gaussian integers '''Z'''[''i''] is a Carmichael ideal.\n\nBoth prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:\n:<math>\\gcd \\left(\\sum_{x=1}^{n-1} x^{n-1}, n\\right)=1</math>\n\n==Higher-order Carmichael numbers==\nCarmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nThe above definition states that a composite integer ''n'' is Carmichael\nprecisely when the ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> from the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> of integers modulo ''n'' to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>.\nAs above, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.\n\nThe ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is also defined on any '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra '''A'''. A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> are algebra endomorphisms.\n\nIn-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.\n\n===An order 2 Carmichael number===\nAccording to Howe, 17 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 43 \u00b7 89 \u00b7 97 \u00b7 167 \u00b7 331 is an order 2 Carmichael number.

An example is when international treaties require control of a substance. In addition, {{uscsub|21|811|h}} allows the Attorney General to temporarily place a substance in Schedule I \"to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety\". Thirty days' notice is required before the order can be issued, and the scheduling expires after a year; however, the period may be extended six months if rulemaking proceedings to permanently schedule the drug are in progress. In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated. Unlike ordinary scheduling proceedings, such temporary orders are not subject to [[judicial review]].\n\nThe CSA also creates a closed system of distribution<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Closed System of Controlled Substance Distribution |title=Pharmacy Practice and the Law |page=184 |first=Richard R. |last=Abood |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn=978-1-4496-8691-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9gp80lkqXMC&pg=PA184 |access-date=2012-12-30 }}</ref> for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.\n\n==Treaty obligations==\nThe Congressional findings in [[21 USC]] \u00a7\u00a7 {{USCSub2|21|801|7}}, {{USCSub2|21|801a|2}}, and {{USCSub2|21|801a|3}} state that a major purpose of the CSA is to \"enable the United States to meet all of its obligations\" under international [[treaty|treaties]]. The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several Schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.\n\nThe domestic and international legal nature of these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts. In ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:\n\n{{quote|\n[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution, declares:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .\"\n\nThere is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights\u2014let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition\u2014to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. For example, in ''Geofroy v. Riggs'', 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\nThis Court has repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html|title=Reid v.

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.<ref name=\"cato.org\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf |title=Cato Handbook for Congress: Policy Recommendations for the 108th Congress |chapter=The War on Drugs |chapter-format=PDF |pages=171\u2013178 |year=2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>\n\nA provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to \"issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,\" without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to \"evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.\"\n\nSimilarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a Schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different Schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.\n\nThis provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:\n\n{{quote|Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html \"Date Rape\" Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.<ref name=\"cato.org\"/> The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]].
