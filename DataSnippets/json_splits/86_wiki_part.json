Heimdallr is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and hearing, and keeps watch for invaders  and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] while drinking fine [[mead]] in his dwelling [[Himinbj\u00f6rg]], located where the burning rainbow bridge [[Bifr\u00f6st]] meets the sky. Heimdallr is said to be the originator of [[social class]]es among humanity and once regained Freyja's treasured possession [[Br\u00edsingamen]] while doing battle in the shape of a [[Pinniped|seal]] with [[Loki]]. Heimdallr and Loki are foretold to kill one another during the events of Ragnar\u00f6k. Heimdallr is additionally referred to as '''Rig''', '''Hallinski\u00f0i''', '''Gullintanni''', and '''Vindl\u00e9r''' or '''Vindhl\u00e9r'''.\n\nHeimdallr is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material; in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', both written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; in the poetry of [[skald]]s; and on an Old Norse [[Runic inscriptions|runic inscription]] found in [[England]]. Two lines of an otherwise lost poem about the god, ''[[Heimdalargaldr]]'', survive. Due to the problematic and enigmatic nature of these attestations, scholars have produced various theories about the nature of the god, including his apparent relation to [[Sheep|ram]]s, that he may be a personification of or connected to the world tree [[Yggdrasil]], and potential [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] cognates.\n\n==Names and etymology==\nThe etymology of the name is obscure, but 'the one who illuminates the world' has been proposed. ''Heimdallr'' may be connected to ''Mard\u00f6ll'', one of [[List of names of Freyja|Freyja's names]].<ref name=\"SIMEK135AND202\">Simek (2007:135 and 202).</ref> ''Heimdallr'' and its variants are sometimes modernly [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as '''Heimdall''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|e\u026a|m|d|\u0251\u02d0|l}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/heimdall \"Heimdall\"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> with the nominative ''-r'' dropped).\n\nHeimdallr is attested as having three other names; ''Hallinski\u00f0i'', ''Gullintanni'', and ''Vindl\u00e9r'' or ''Vindhl\u00e9r''. The name ''Hallinski\u00f0i'' is obscure, but has resulted in a series of attempts at deciphering it. ''Gullintanni'' literally means 'the one with the golden teeth'. ''Vindl\u00e9r'' (or ''Vindhl\u00e9r'') translates as either 'the one protecting against the wind' or 'wind-sea'. All three have resulted in numerous theories about the god.<ref name=\"HEIMDALLR-NAMES\">Simek (2007:122, 128, and 363).</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\n\n===Saltfleetby spindle whorl inscription===\nA [[lead]] [[spindle whorl]] bearing an [[Old Norse]]  [[Younger Futhark]] inscription that mentions Heimdallr was discovered in [[Saltfleetby]], [[England]] on September 1, 2010. The spindle whorl itself is dated from the year 1000 to 1100 AD. On the inscription, the god Heimdallr is mentioned alongside the god [[Odin]] and [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]], a name of one of the god [[Thor]]'s servants. Regarding the inscription reading, John Hines of [[Cardiff University]] comments that there is \"quite an essay to be written over the uncertainties of translation and identification here; what are clear, and very important, are the names of two of the Norse gods on the side, Odin and Heimdallr, while \u00dejalfi (masculine, not the feminine in -a) is the recorded name of a servant of the god Thor.\"<ref name=\"DAUBNEY\">Daubney (2010).</ref>\n\n===''Poetic Edda''===\nIn the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', Heimdallr is attested in six poems; ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'', ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', ''[[Lokasenna]]'', ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'', ''[[R\u00edgs\u00feula]]'', and ''[[Hrafnagaldr \u00d3\u00f0ins]]''.\n\nHeimdallr is mentioned thrice in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. In the first stanza of the poem, the undead [[v\u00f6lva]] reciting the poem calls out for listeners to be silent and refers to Heimdallr:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>\n:For silence I pray all sacred children,\n:great and small, sons of Heimdall.\n:they will that I Valfather's deeds recount,\n:men's ancient saws, those that I best remember.<ref name=\"THORPE3\">Thorpe (1866:3).</ref>\n|\n<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>\n:Hearing I ask from the holy races,\n:From Heimdall's sons, both high and low;\n:Thou wilt, [[List of names of Odin|Valfather]], that well I relate.\n:Old tales I remember of men long ago.<ref name=\"BELLOWS3\">Bellows (1923:3).</ref>\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\nThis stanza has led to various scholarly interpretations. The \"holy races\" have been considered variously as either humanity or the gods. The notion of humanity as \"Heimdallr's sons\" is otherwise unattested and has also resulted in various interpretations. Some scholars have pointed to the prose introduction to the poem ''[[R\u00edgs\u00feula]]'', where Heimdallr is said to have once gone about people, slept between couples, and so doled out classes among them (see ''R\u00edgsthula'' section below).<ref name=\"HEIMDALLRS-SONS\">See discussion at Thorpe (1866:3), Bellows (1923:3), and Larrington (1999:264).</ref>\n[[File:Heimdallr by Froelich.jpg|thumb|Heimdallr blows Gjallarhorn in an 1895 illustration by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\nLater in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', the v\u00f6lva foresees the events of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] and the role in which Heimdallr and [[Gjallarhorn]] will play at its onset; Heimdallr will raise his horn and blow loudly.

Schach details that \"''Heimdallar hlj\u00f3\u00f0'' has aroused much speculation. Snorri [in the ''Prose Edda''] seems to have confused this word with ''gjallarhorn'', but there is otherwise no attestation of the use of ''hlj\u00f3\u00f0'' in the sense of 'horn' in Icelandic. Various scholars have read this as \"hearing\" rather than \"horn\".<ref name=\"SCHACH93\">Schach (1985:93).</ref>\n\nScholar [[Carolyne Larrington]] comments that if \"hearing\" rather than \"horn\" is understood to appear in this stanza, the stanza indicates that Heimdallr, like Odin, has left a body part in the well; his ear. Larrington says that \"Odin exchanged one of his eyes for wisdom from Mimir, guardian of the well, while Heimdall seems to have forfeited his ear.\"<ref name=\"LARRINGTON265\">Larrington (1999:265).</ref>\n\nIn the poem ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr\u00edmnir]]''), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young [[Agnarr Geirr\u00f6\u00f0sson|Agnar]] of a number of mythological locations. The eighth location he mentions is Himinbj\u00f6rg, where he says that Heimdallr drinks fine [[mead]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n<small>Benjamin Thorpe translation:</small>\n:Himinbi\u00f6rg is the eighth, where Heimdall,\n:it is said, rules o'er the holy fanes:\n:there the gods' watchman, in his tranquil home,\n:drinks joyful the good mead.<ref name=\"THORPE21\">Thorpe (1866:21).</ref>\n|\n<small>Henry Adams Bellows translation:</small>\n:Himingbjorg is the eighth, and Heimdall there\n:O'er men holds sway, it is said;\n:In his well-built house does the warder of heaven\n:The good mead gladly drink.<ref name=\"BELLOWS90\">Bellows (1923:90).</ref>\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\nRegarding the above stanza, [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] comments that \"in this stanza the two functions of Heimdall\u2014as father of humanity [ . . . ] and as warder of the gods\u2014seem both to be mentioned, but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions it is more or less conjecture\".<ref name=\"BELLOWS90\"/>\n\nIn the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] [[flyting|flyts]] with various gods who have met together to feast. At one point during the exchanges, the god Heimdallr says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was [[wyrd|fated]] a \"hateful life\", that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and that he must serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] interjects and the flyting continues in turn.<ref name=\"LARRINGTON92\">Larrington (1999:92).</ref>\n\nThe poem ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' tells of Thor's loss of his hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], to the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]] and quest to get it back. At one point in the tale, the gods gather at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] and debate how to get Thor's hammer back from the j\u00f6tnar, who demand the beautiful goddess [[Freyja]] in return for it. Heimdallr advises that they simply dress Thor up as Freyja, during which he is described as ''hv\u00edtastr \u00e1sa'' (translations of the phrase vary below) and is said to have [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]] like the [[Vanir]], a group of gods:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n<small>Benjamin Thorpe translation:</small>\n:Then said Heimdall, of [[\u00c6sir]] brightest \u2014\n:he well foresaw, like other Vanir \u2014\n:Let us clothe Thor with bridal raiment,\n:let him have the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen|Br\u00eesinga necklace]].\n:\"Let by his side keys jingle,\n:and woman's weeds fall around his knees,\n:but on his breast place precious stones,\n:and a neat coif set on his head.\"<ref name=\"THORPE64\">Thorpe (1866:64).</ref>\n|\n<small>Henry Adams Bellows translation:</small>\n:Then Heimdall spake, whitest of the gods,\n:Like the Wanes he knew the future well:\n:\"Bind we on Thor the bridal veil,\n:Let him bear the mighty Brisings' necklace;\n:\"Keys around him let there rattle,\n:And down to his knees hang woman's dress;\n:With gems full broad upon his breast,\n:And a pretty cap to crown his head.\"<ref name=\"BELLOWS178\">Bellows (1923:178).</ref>\n|\n<small>[[Jeramy Dodds]] translation:</small>\n:The most glittering of gods, Heimdall, who,\n:like the Vanir, is gifted with the gift of foresight,\n:sad: 'Let's strap a bridal veil over Thor's face\n:and let him don the Brising necklace.<ref name=\"DODDS-2014-110\">Dodds (2014:110).</ref>\n:'Let the wedlock keys jingle around his waist,\n:and dress him in a woman's dress to his knees\n:and loop giant gems across his chest\n:and top him off with a stylish headdress.'<ref name=\"DODDS-2014-110\">Dodds (2014:110).</ref>\n|}\n</blockquote>\nRegarding Heimdallr's whiteness and the comparison to the Vanir, scholar [[John Lindow]] comments that there are no other indications of Heimdallr being considered among the Vanir, and that Heimdallr's status as \"whitest of the gods\" has not been explained.<ref name=\"LINDOW170\">Lindow (2002:170).</ref>\n[[File:Rig in Great-grandfather's Cottage.jpg|thumb|''Rig in Great-grandfather's Cottage'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\nThe introductory prose to the poem ''[[R\u00edgs\u00feula]]'' says that \"people say in the old stories\" that Heimdallr, described as a god among the [[\u00c6sir]], once fared on a journey. Heimdallr wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as ''R\u00edgr''. In the poem, R\u00edgr, who is described as a wise and powerful god, walks in the middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between them in their bed. The wives of the couples become pregnant, and from them come the various classes of humanity. Eventually a warrior home produces a promising boy, and as the boy grows older, R\u00edgr comes out of a thicket, teaches the boy [[runic alphabet|runes]], gives him a name, and proclaims him to be his son. R\u00edgr tells him to strike out and get land for himself. The boy does so, and so becomes a great war leader with many estates. He marries a beautiful woman and the two have many children and are happy. One of the children eventually becomes so skilled that he is able to share in runic knowledge with Heimdallr, and so earns the title of ''R\u00edgr'' himself. The poem continues without further mention of the god.<ref name=\"LARRINGTON246-252\">Larrington (1999:246\u2014252).</ref>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n[[File:Heimdal (1907) by J. T.

Illustration (1907) by [[J. T. Lundbye]].]]\nIn the ''Prose Edda'', Heimdallr is mentioned in the books ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'', and ''[[H\u00e1ttatal]]''. In ''Gylfaginning'', the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] tells the disguised mythical king [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] of various gods, and, in chapter 25, mentions Heimdallr. High says that Heimdallr is known \"the white [[\u00c6sir|As]]\", is \"great and holy\", and that [[Nine Mothers of Heimdallr|nine maidens]], all sisters, gave birth to him. Heimdallr is called ''Hallinski\u00f0i'' and ''Gullintanni'', and he has gold teeth. High continues that Heimdallr lives in \"a place\" called [[Himinbj\u00f6rg]] and that it is near [[Bifr\u00f6st]]. Heimdallr is the watchman of the gods, and he sits on the edge of heaven to guard the Bifr\u00f6st bridge from the berg [[j\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]]. Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, can see at night just as well as if it were day, and for over a hundred leagues. Heimdallr's hearing is also quite keen; he can hear grass as it grows on the earth, wool as it grows on sheep, and anything louder. Heimdallr possesses a trumpet, Gjallarhorn, that, when blown, can be heard in [[Norse cosmology|all worlds]], and \"the [[head]] is referred to as [[H\u01ebfu\u00f0|Heimdall's sword]]\". High then quotes the above-mentioned ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' stanza about Himinbj\u00f6rg and provides two lines from the otherwise lost poem about Heimdallr, ''[[Heimdalargaldr]]'', in which Heimdallr proclaims himself to be the son of [[Nine Mothers of Heimdallr|Nine Mothers]].<ref name=\"FAULKES25-26\">Faulkes (1995:25-26).</ref>\n\nIn chapter 49, High tells of the god [[Baldr]]'s funeral procession.

See Faulkes (1995:68) for [[\u00dalfr Uggason]]'s ''[[H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa]]'' handling this.</ref>\n\nIn chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnar\u00f6k. After the enemies of the gods will gather at the plain [[V\u00edgr\u00ed\u00f0r]], Heimdallr will stand and mightily blow into Gjallarhorn. The gods will awake and assemble together at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. At the end of the battle between various gods and their enemies, Heimdallr will face Loki and they will kill one another. After, the world will be engulfed in flames.

The section adds that the poem ''[[Heimdalargaldr]]'' is about him, and that, since the poem, \"the head has been called Heimdall's doom: man's doom is an expression for sword\". Hiemdallr is the owner of [[Gulltoppr]], is also known as Vindhl\u00e9r, and is a [[sons of Odin|son of Odin]]. Heimdallr visits [[V\u00e1gasker]] and [[Singasteinn]] and there vied with Loki for [[Br\u00edsingamen]]. According to the chapter, the skald \u00dalfr Uggason composed a large section of his ''H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa'' about these events and that ''H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa'' says that the two were in the shape of seals. A few chapters later, ways of referring to Loki are provided, including \"wrangler with Heimdall and [[Ska\u00f0i|Skadi]]\", and section of \u00dalfr Uggason's ''H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa'' is then provided in reference:\n<blockquote>\n:Renowned defender [Heimdall] of the powers' way [Bifrost], kind of counsel, competes with [[F\u00e1rbauti|Farbauti]]'s terribly sly son at Singastein.

Snorri writes that Odin settled in [[M\u00e4laren|Lake Logrin]] \"at a place which formerly was called [[Fornsigtuna|Sigt\u00fanir]].

In addition to its role as the upper house, until the establishment of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in 2009, the House of Lords, through the [[Law Lords]], acted as the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom judicial system.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |title=Parliamentary sovereignty |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> The House also has a Church of England role, in that [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919|Church Measures]] must be tabled within the House by the Lords Spiritual.\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}\nToday's Parliament of the United Kingdom largely descends, in practice, from the [[Parliament of England]], though the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1706 and the [[Acts of Union, 1707|Acts of Union]] that ratified the Treaty in 1707 created a new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to replace the Parliament of England and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. This new parliament was, in effect, the continuation of the Parliament of England with the addition of 45 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and 16 Peers to represent Scotland.\n\nThe House of Lords developed from the \"Great Council\" (''[[Magnum Concilium]]'') that advised the King during medieval times.<ref name=loveland1>[[#Loveland|Loveland]] (2009) p. 158</ref> This royal council came to be composed of ecclesiastics, noblemen, and representatives of the [[Historic counties of England|counties of England]] and [[Historic counties of Wales|Wales]] (afterwards, representatives of the [[Parliamentary borough|boroughs]] as well). The first English Parliament is often considered to be the \"[[Model Parliament]]\" (held in 1295), which included archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and representatives of the shires and boroughs of it.\n\nThe power of Parliament grew slowly, fluctuating as the strength of the monarchy grew or declined. For example, during much of the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] (1307\u20131327), the [[nobility]] was supreme, the [[The Crown|Crown]] weak, and the shire and borough representatives entirely powerless. In 1569, the authority of Parliament was for the first time recognised not simply by custom or royal charter, but by an authoritative statute, passed by Parliament itself.\n\nDuring the reign of Edward II's successor, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], Parliament clearly separated into two distinct [[debating chamber|chambers]]: the House of Commons (consisting of the shire and borough representatives) and the House of Lords (consisting of the bishops, abbots and [[peerage of England|peers]]). The authority of Parliament continued to grow, and during the early 15th century both Houses exercised powers to an extent not seen before. The Lords were far more powerful than the Commons because of the great influence of the great landowners and the prelates of the realm.\n\nThe power of the nobility declined during the civil wars of the late 15th century, known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Much of the nobility was killed on the battlefield or executed for participation in the war, and many aristocratic estates were lost to the Crown. Moreover, [[feudalism]] was dying, and the [[feudal]] armies controlled by the [[barons]] became obsolete. Henry VII (1485\u20131509) clearly established the supremacy of the monarch, symbolised by the \"Crown Imperial\". The domination of the Sovereign continued to grow during the reigns of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor monarchs]] in the 16th century. The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (1509\u20131547).\n\nThe House of Lords remained more powerful than the House of Commons, but the Lower House continued to grow in influence, reaching a zenith in relation to the House of Lords during the middle 17th century. Conflicts between the King and the Parliament (for the most part, the House of Commons) ultimately led to the [[English Civil War]] during the 1640s. In 1649, after the defeat and execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Commonwealth of England]] was declared, but the nation was effectively under the overall control of [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Lord Protector|Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland]].<ref name=abolishact>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur089.htm|title=An Act abolishing the House of Lords|accessdate=24 May 2008|date=19 March 1649}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Lords was reduced to a largely powerless body, with Cromwell and his supporters in the Commons dominating the Government. On 19 March 1649, the House of Lords was abolished by an Act of Parliament, which declared that \"The Commons of England [find] by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England.\"<ref name=abolishact/> The House of Lords did not assemble again until the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] met in 1660 and the monarchy was restored. It returned to its former position as the more powerful chamber of Parliament\u2014a position it would occupy until the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Queen Anne in the House of Lords by Peter Tillemans.jpeg|thumb|[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] addressing the House of Lords, c. 1708\u201314, by [[Peter Tillemans]] ]]\n[[File:House of lords and princes chamber.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A monochrome illustration of several short buildings clustered in a small space.

The House, once a body of only about 50&nbsp;members, had been greatly enlarged by the liberality of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;III]] and his successors in creating peerages. The individual influence of a Lord of Parliament was thus diminished.\n\nMoreover, the power of the House as a whole decreased, whilst that of the House of Commons grew. Particularly notable in the development of the Lower House's superiority was the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]]. The electoral system of the House of Commons was far from democratic: property qualifications greatly restricted the size of the electorate, and the boundaries of many constituencies had not been changed for centuries.\n\nEntire cities such as [[Manchester]] were not represented by a single individual in the House of Commons, but the 11 voters of [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] retained their ancient right to elect two MPs. A small borough was susceptible to bribery, and was often under the control of a patron, whose nominee was guaranteed to win an election. Some aristocrats were patrons of numerous \"[[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]]\", and therefore controlled a considerable part of the membership of the House of Commons.\n\nWhen the House of Commons passed a Reform Bill to correct some of these anomalies in 1831, the House of Lords rejected the proposal. The popular cause of reform, however, was not abandoned by the ministry, despite a second rejection of the bill in 1832. Prime Minister [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]] advised the King to overwhelm opposition to the bill in the House of Lords by creating about 80&nbsp;new pro-Reform peers. [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] originally balked at the proposal, which effectively threatened the opposition of the House of Lords, but at length relented.\n\nBefore the new peers were created, however, the Lords who opposed the bill admitted defeat and abstained from the vote, allowing the passage of the bill. The crisis damaged the political influence of the House of Lords but did not altogether end it. A vital reform was effected by the Lords themselves in 1868, when they changed their standing orders to abolish proxy voting, preventing Lords from voting without taking the trouble to attend.<ref>McKechnie, ''The reform of the House of Lords'' etc</ref> Over the course of the century the power of the Upper House were further eroded,{{how|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and the Commons gradually became the stronger House of Parliament.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1911-New-Perrs-UK-Punch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''Punch'' 1911 cartoon shows Asquith and Lloyd George preparing coronets for 500 new peers to threaten takeover of House of Lords]]\n\nThe status of the House of Lords returned to the forefront of debate after the election of a Liberal Government in 1906. In 1909, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], David Lloyd George, introduced into the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] the \"People's Budget\", which proposed a land tax targeting wealthy landowners. The popular measure, however, was defeated in the heavily Conservative House of Lords.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England'' (1935) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.175390 online free] </ref>\n\nHaving made the powers of the House of Lords a primary campaign issue, the Liberals were narrowly re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910]]. Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] then proposed that the powers of the House of Lords be severely curtailed. After a further general election in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]], and with an undertaking by King [[George V]] to create sufficient new Liberal peers to overcome Lords' opposition to the measure if necessary, the Asquith Government secured the passage of a bill to curtail the powers of the House of Lords.\n\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] effectively abolished the power of the House of Lords to reject legislation, or to amend it in a way unacceptable to the House of Commons: most bills could be delayed for no more than three parliamentary sessions or two calendar years. It was not meant to be a permanent solution; more comprehensive reforms were planned. Neither party, however, pursued the matter with much enthusiasm, and the House of Lords remained primarily hereditary. In 1949, the Parliament Act reduced the delaying power of the House of Lords further to two sessions or one year.\n\nIn 1958, the predominantly hereditary nature of the House of Lords was changed by the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], which authorised the creation of life baronies, with no numerical limits. The number of Life Peers then gradually increased, though not at a constant rate.\n\nThe Labour Party had for most of the 20th century a commitment, based on the party's historic opposition to class privilege, to abolish the House of Lords, or at least expel the hereditary element. In 1968, the Labour Government of [[Harold Wilson]] attempted to reform the House of Lords by introducing a system under which hereditary peers would be allowed to remain in the House and take part in debate, but would be unable to vote. This plan, however, was defeated in the House of Commons by a coalition of traditionalist Conservatives (such as [[Enoch Powell]]), and Labour members who continued to advocate the outright abolition of the Upper House (such as [[Michael Foot]]).\n\nWhen Michael Foot became leader of the Labour Party in 1980, abolition of the House of Lords became a part of the party's agenda; under his successor, [[Neil Kinnock]], however, a reformed Upper House was proposed instead. In the meantime, the creation of hereditary peerages (except for members of the Royal Family) has been arrested, with the exception of three creations during the administration of the Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s.\n\nWhilst some hereditary peers were at best apathetic, the Labour Party's clear commitments were not lost on [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley]], who for decades was considered an expert on the House of Lords. In December 1979 the [[Conservative Monday Club]] published his extensive paper entitled ''Lords Reform \u2013 Why tamper with the House of Lords?'' and in July 1980 [[International Monarchist League|''The Monarchist'']] carried another article by Sudeley entitled ''Why Reform or Abolish the House of Lords?''.<ref>''The Monarchist'', no. 57, p.&nbsp;27 \u2013 34</ref> In 1990 he wrote a further booklet for the Monday Club entitled ''The Preservation of the House of Lords''.\n\n===Lords reform===\n{{Main|Reform of the House of Lords}}\n\n====First admission of women====\nThere were no women sitting in the House of Lords until 1958, when a small number came into the chamber as a result of the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]. One of these was [[Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale]], who had inherited her father's peerage in 1925 and was made a life peer to enable her to sit. After a campaign stretching back in some cases to the 1920s, another twelve women who held hereditary peerages in their own right were finally admitted by the [[Peerage Act 1963]].\n\n====1997\u20132010====\nThe Labour Party included in its 1997 general election [[Manifesto]] a commitment to remove the hereditary peerage from the House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Labour's 1997 pledges: The constitution | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 6 May 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2002/blair_years/1959867.stm }}</ref> Their subsequent election victory in 1997 under [[Tony Blair]] led to the denouement of the traditional House of Lords. The Labour Government introduced legislation to expel all hereditary peers from the Upper House as a first step in Lords reform. As a part of a compromise, however, it agreed to permit 92 hereditary peers to remain until the reforms were complete. Thus all but 92 hereditary peers were expelled under the House of Lords Act 1999 (see below for its provisions), making the House of Lords predominantly an appointed house.\n\nSince 1999, however, no further reform has taken place. The [[Wakeham Commission]] proposed introducing a 20% elected element to the Lords, but this plan was widely criticised.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Lords report fails to satisfy | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 20 January 2000 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/611889.stm }}</ref> A [[Joint Committee]] was established in 2001 to resolve the issue, but it reached no conclusion and instead gave Parliament seven options to choose from (fully appointed, 20% elected, 40% elected, 50% elected, 60% elected, 80%, and fully elected). In a confusing series of votes in February 2003, all of these options were defeated, although the 80% elected option fell by just three votes in the Commons.

Most of the remainder were to be appointed by a Commission to ensure a mix of \"skills, knowledge and experience\". This proposal was also not implemented. A cross-party campaign initiative called \"[[Elect the Lords]]\" was set up to make the case for a predominantly elected Second Chamber in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].\n\nAt the 2005 election, the Labour Party proposed further reform of the Lords, but without specific details.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Election issues: Constitutional Reform | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 5 April 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/issues/4372135.stm }}</ref> The Conservative Party, which had, prior to 1997, opposed any tampering with the House of Lords{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, favoured an 80% elected Second Chamber, while the Liberal Democrats called for a fully elected [[Senate]].

The House of Lords, she argues, currently has enough power to make it relevant. During Tony Blair's first year, he was defeated 38 times in the Lords.<ref name=treadwell>Treadwell (2010) p.2</ref> Secondly, as to the composition of the Lords, Meg Russell suggests that the composition must be distinct from the Commons, otherwise it would render the Lords useless. The third feature is the perceived legitimacy of the Lords. She writes, \"In general legitimacy comes with election.\"<ref name=russell>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-923X.00540 | issn = 0032-3179 | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u2012318 | last = Russell | first = Meg | title = Is the House of Lords Already Reformed? | journal = The Political Quarterly | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = July 2003 | url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/1467-923X.00540 }}</ref><ref name=treadwell/>\n\nIf the Lords have a distinct and elected composition, this would probably come about through fixed term proportional representation. If this happens, then the perceived legitimacy of the Lords could arguably outweigh the legitimacy of the Commons. This would especially be the case if the House of Lords had been elected more recently than the House of Commons as it could be said to reflect the will of the people better than the Commons.<ref name=treadwell/>\n\nIn this scenario, there may well come a time when the Lords twice reject a Bill from the Commons and it is forced through. This would in turn trigger questions about the amount of power the Lords should have and there would be pressure for it to increase. This hypothetical process is known as the \"circumnavigation of power theory\".<ref name=treadwell/> It implies that it would never be in any government's interest to legitimise the Lords, as they would be forfeiting their own power.\n\n====2010\u2013present====\nThe Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreed, after the 2010 general election, to outline clearly a provision for a wholly or mainly elected second chamber, elected by proportional representation. These proposals sparked a debate on 29 June 2010. As an interim measure, appointment of new peers would reflect the shares of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election.\n\nDetailed proposals for Lords reform, including a draft House of Lords Reform Bill, were published on 17 May 2011. These included a 300-member hybrid house, of whom 80% would be elected. A further 20% would be appointed, and reserve space would be included for some Church of England bishops.

However, the power of the Lords to reject a bill passed by the House of Commons is severely restricted by the Parliament Acts. Under those Acts, certain types of bills may be presented for the [[Royal Assent]] without the consent of the House of Lords (i.e. the Commons can override the Lords' veto). The House of Lords cannot delay a money bill (a bill that, in the view of the Speaker of the House of Commons, solely concerns national taxation or public funds) for more than one month.\n\nOther public bills cannot be delayed by the House of Lords for more than two parliamentary sessions, or one calendar year. These provisions, however, only apply to public bills that originate in the House of Commons, and cannot have the effect of extending a parliamentary term beyond five years. A further restriction is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] known as the [[Salisbury Convention]], which means that the House of Lords does not oppose legislation promised in the Government's election manifesto.\n\nBy a custom that prevailed even before the Parliament Acts, the House of Lords is further restrained insofar as financial bills are concerned. The House of Lords may neither originate a bill concerning taxation or Supply (supply of treasury or exchequer funds), nor amend a bill so as to insert a taxation or Supply-related provision. (The House of Commons, however, often waives its privileges and allows the Upper House to make amendments with financial implications.) Moreover, the Upper House may not amend any Supply Bill. The House of Lords formerly maintained the absolute power to reject a bill relating to revenue or Supply, but this power was curtailed by the Parliament Acts, as aforementioned.\n\n===Former judicial role===\n{{Main|Judicial functions of the House of Lords}}\nHistorically, the House of Lords held several judicial functions. Most notably, until 2009 the House of Lords served as the [[court of last resort]] for most instances of UK law. Since 1 October 2009 this role is now held by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].\n\nThe Lords' judicial functions originated from the ancient role of the [[Curia Regis]] as a body that addressed the petitions of the King's subjects. The functions were exercised not by the whole House, but by a committee of \"Law Lords\". The bulk of the House's judicial business was conducted by the twelve [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]], who were specifically appointed for this purpose under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]].\n\nThe judicial functions could also be exercised by Lords of Appeal (other members of the House who happened to have held high judicial office). No Lord of Appeal in Ordinary or Lord of Appeal could sit judicially beyond the age of seventy-five. The judicial business of the Lords was supervised by the Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and their deputy, the Second Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the House of Lords extended, in civil and in criminal cases, to appeals from the courts of England and Wales, and of Northern Ireland. From Scotland, appeals were possible only in civil cases; Scotland's [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the highest court in criminal matters. The House of Lords was not the United Kingdom's only court of last resort; in some cases, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] performs such a function. The jurisdiction of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom, however, is relatively restricted; it encompasses appeals from [[ecclesiastical]] courts, disputes under the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]], and a few other minor matters. Issues related to [[devolution]] were transferred from the Privy Council to the Supreme Court in 2009.\n\nThe twelve Law Lords did not all hear every case; rather, after World War II cases were heard by panels known as Appellate Committees, each of which normally consisted of five members (selected by the Senior Lord). An Appellate Committee hearing an important case could consist of more than five members. Though Appellate Committees met in separate committee rooms, judgement was given in the Lords Chamber itself. No further appeal lay from the House of Lords, although the House of Lords could refer a \"preliminary question\" to the [[European Court of Justice]] in cases involving an element of [[European Union law]], and a case could be brought at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if the House of Lords did not provide a satisfactory remedy in cases where the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was relevant.\n\nA distinct judicial function\u2014one in which the whole House used to participate\u2014is that of trying [[impeachment]]s. Impeachments were brought by the House of Commons, and tried in the House of Lords; a conviction required only a majority of the Lords voting. Impeachments, however, are to all intents and purposes obsolete; the last impeachment was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]], in 1806.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Lords was once the court that tried peers charged with high [[treason]] or [[felony]]. The House would be presided over not by the Lord Chancellor, but by the [[Lord High Steward]], an official especially appointed for the occasion of the trial. If Parliament was not in session, then peers could be tried in a separate court, known as the Lord High Steward's Court. Only peers, their wives, and their widows (unless remarried) were entitled to [[List of trials of peers in the House of Lords|such trials]]; the Lords Spiritual were tried in ecclesiastical courts. In 1948, the right of peers to be tried in such special courts was abolished; now, they are tried in the regular courts.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/58/section/30/enacted Criminal Justice Act 1948, section 30 (repealed)]</ref> The last such trial in the House was of [[Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford]], in 1935. An illustrative dramatisation circa 1928 of a trial of a peer (the fictional Duke of Denver) on a charge of murder (a felony) is portrayed in the 1972 BBC Television adaption of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] mystery ''[[Clouds of Witness]]''.\n\nThe [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] resulted in the creation of a separate Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, to which the judicial function of the House of Lords, and some of the judicial functions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, were transferred. In addition, the office of Lord Chancellor was reformed by the act, removing his ability to act as both a government minister and a judge. This was motivated in part by concerns about the historical admixture of legislative, judicial, and executive power. The new Supreme Court is located at [[Middlesex Guildhall]].\n\n==Membership==\n{{Peerage}}\n\n===Lords Spiritual===\n{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}\nMembers of the House of Lords who sit by virtue of their ecclesiastical offices are known as Lords Spiritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/lords-spiritual-and-temporal/|title=Lords Spiritual and Temporal|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> Formerly, the Lords Spiritual were the majority in the English House of Lords,<ref name=shell1>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.54</ref> comprising the church's [[archbishop]]s, (diocesan) bishops, [[abbot]]s, and those [[prior]]s who were entitled to wear a [[mitre]]. After the [[English Reformation]]'s highpoint in 1539, only the archbishops and bishops continued to attend, as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] had just disproved of{{clarify|date=December 2017}} and suppressed the positions of abbot and prior. In 1642, during the few Lords' gatherings convened during [[English Interregnum]] which saw periodic war, the Lords Spiritual were excluded altogether, but they returned under the [[Clergy Act 1661]].\n\nThe number of Lords Spiritual was further restricted by the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]], and by later Acts. The Lords Spiritual can now number no more than 26; these are the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] (who sit by right regardless of seniority) and the 21 longest-serving bishops from other [[diocese]]s in the Church of England<ref>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.53</ref> (excluding the dioceses of [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]] and [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Gibraltar in Europe]], as these lie entirely outside the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/en/ukpgaen_20010013_en_1|title=Explanatory Notes to The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|location=London, United Kingdom|accessdate=5 September 2009|date=21 May 2001}}</ref> Following a change to the law in 2014 to allow women to be ordained bishops, the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] was passed, which provides that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the five bishops who sit by right.\n\nThe current Lords Spiritual represent only the Church of England. Bishops of the [[Church of Scotland]] historically sat in the Parliament of Scotland but were finally excluded in 1689 (after a number of previous exclusions) when the Church of Scotland became permanently Presbyterian. There are no longer [[bishops in the Church of Scotland]] in the traditional sense of the word, and that Church has never sent members to sit in the Westminster House of Lords. The [[Church of Ireland]] did obtain representation in the House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801.\n\nOf the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted about one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|disestablished]] in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual. Bishops of Welsh sees in the Church of England originally sat in the House of Lords (after 1847, only if their seniority within the Church entitled them to), but the [[Church in Wales]] ceased to be a part of the Church of England in 1920 and was simultaneously [[Disestablishment of the Church in Wales|disestablished]] in Wales.<ref>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.55</ref> Accordingly, bishops of the Church in Wales were no longer eligible to be appointed to the House as bishops of the Church of England, but those already appointed remained.\n\nOther ecclesiastics have sat in the House of Lords as Lords Temporal in recent times: [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] was appointed to the House of Lords (with the consent of the Queen, who acted on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), as was his successor Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadContent1849.aspx |title=Biography of the Chief Rabbi |publisher=Office of the Chief Rabbi |location=London, United Kingdom |accessdate=16 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042614/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadContent1849.aspx |archivedate=1 October 2009 }}</ref> [[Julia Neuberger]] is the Senior Rabbi to the West London Synagogue. In recognition of his work at reconciliation and in the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] (the senior Anglican bishop in [[Northern Ireland]]), [[Robin Eames]], was appointed to the Lords by [[John Major]]. Other clergymen appointed include [[Donald Soper]], [[Timothy Beaumont]], and some Scottish clerics.\n\nThere have been no Roman Catholic clergymen appointed, though it was rumoured that [[Basil Hume|Cardinal Basil Hume]] and his successor [[Cormac Murphy O'Connor]] were offered peerages, by [[James Callaghan]], Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair respectively, but declined. Hume later accepted the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]], a personal appointment of the Queen, shortly before his death. O'Connor said he had his maiden speech ready, but Roman Catholics who have received Holy Orders are prohibited by [[Canon Law]] from holding major offices connected with any government other than the [[Holy See]].\n\nFormer Archbishops of Canterbury, having reverted to the status of bishop but who are no longer diocesans, are invariably given life peerages and sit as Lords Temporal.\n\nBy custom at least one of the Bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the chaplain in the Commons).<ref name=shell1/> They often speak in debates; in 2004 [[Rowan Williams]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, opened a debate into sentencing legislation.<ref name=shell1/> [[List of Church of England Measures|Measures]] ([[Bill (proposed law)|proposed laws]] of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this takes place.<ref name=shell1/>\n\n===Lords Temporal===\nSince the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Lords Temporal have been the most numerous group in the House of Lords. Unlike the Lords Spiritual, they may be publicly partisan, aligning themselves with one or another of the political parties that dominate the House of Commons. Publicly non-partisan Lords are called [[crossbencher]]s. Originally, the Lords Temporal included several hundred hereditary peers (that is, those whose peerages may be inherited), who ranked variously as [[duke]]s, [[marquess]]es, [[earl]]s, [[viscount]]s, and [[baron]]s (as well as Scottish [[Lords of Parliament]]). Such hereditary dignities can be created by the Crown; in modern times this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day (except in the case of members of the Royal Family).\n\nHolders of [[peerage of Scotland|Scottish]] and Irish peerages were not always permitted to sit in the Lords. When Scotland united with England to form [[Great Britain]] in 1707, it was provided that the Scottish hereditary peers would only be able to elect 16 [[representative peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords; the term of a representative was to extend until the next general election. A similar provision was enacted when Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801 to form the [[United Kingdom]]; the Irish peers were allowed to elect 28 representatives, who were to retain office for life. Elections for Irish representatives ended in 1922, when most of Ireland became an independent state; elections for Scottish representatives ended with the passage of the [[Peerage Act 1963]], under which all Scottish peers obtained seats in the Upper House.\n\nIn 1999, the Labour government brought forward the House of Lords Act removing the right of several hundred hereditary peers to sit in the House. The Act provided, as a measure intended to be temporary, that 92 people would continue to sit in the Lords by virtue of hereditary peerages, and this is still in effect.\n\nOf the 92, two remain in the House of Lords because they hold royal offices connected with Parliament: the [[Earl Marshal#England|Earl Marshal]] and the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]]. Of the [[List of elected hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|remaining ninety peers sitting in the Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage]], 15 are elected by the whole House and 75 are chosen by fellow hereditary peers in the House of Lords, grouped by party. (If a hereditary peerage holder is given a life peerage, he or she becomes a member of the House of Lords without a need for a by-election.) The exclusion of other hereditary peers removed [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] (who is also [[Earl of Chester]]) and all other Royal Peers, including [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]]; [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]]; and [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]].\n\nThe number of peers to be chosen by a political group reflects the proportion of hereditary peers that belonged to that group (see [[#Current composition|current composition]] below) in 1999. When an elected hereditary peer dies, a [[By-elections to the House of Lords|by-election]] is held, with a variant of the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system being used. If the recently deceased hereditary peer had been elected by the whole House, then so is his or her replacement; a hereditary peer elected by a specific political group (including the non-aligned crossbenchers) is replaced by a vote of the hereditary peers already elected to the Lords belonging to that political group (whether elected by that group or by the whole house).\n\nUntil 2009, the Lords Temporal also included the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, a group of individuals appointed to the House of Lords so that they could exercise its judicial functions. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, more commonly known as Law Lords, were first appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. They were selected by the Prime Minister of the day, but were formally appointed by the Sovereign. A Lord of Appeal in Ordinary had to retire at the age of 70, or, if his or her term was extended by the government, at the age of 75; after reaching such an age, the Law Lord could not hear any further cases in the House of Lords.\n\nThe number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (excluding those who were no longer able to hear cases because of age restrictions) was limited to twelve, but could be changed by [[statutory instrument]]. By a convention of the House, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary did not take part in debates on new legislation, so as to maintain judicial independence. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary held their seats in the House of Lords for life, remaining as members even after reaching the judicial retirement age of 70 or 75. Former Lord Chancellors and holders of other high judicial office could also sit as Law Lords under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, although in practice this right was only rarely exercised.\n\nUnder the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary when the Act came into effect in 2009 became judges of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and were then barred from sitting or voting in the House of Lords until they had retired as judges. One of the main justifications for the new Supreme Court was to establish a separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature. It is therefore unlikely that future appointees to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will be made Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.\n\nThe largest group of Lords Temporal, and indeed of the whole House, are life peers. Life peerages rank only as barons or baronesses, and are created under the Life Peerages Act 1958. Like all other peers, life peers are created by the Sovereign, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister or the House of Lords Appointments Commission. By convention, however, the Prime Minister allows leaders of other parties to nominate some life peers, so as to maintain a political balance in the House of Lords. Moreover, some non-party life peers (the number being determined by the Prime Minister) are nominated by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission.\n\nIn 2000, the government announced it would set up an Independent Appointments Commission, under [[Dennis Stevenson, Baron Stevenson of Coddenham|Dennis, Lord Stevenson of Coddenham]], to select fifteen so-called \"[[people's peer]]s\" for life peerages. However, when the choices were announced in April 2001, from a list of 3,000 applicants, the choices were treated with criticism in the media, as all were distinguished in their field, and none were \"ordinary people\" as some had originally hoped.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk_politics/2001/open_politics/lords/peoples_peers.stm People's Peers: the strange case of the missing lollipop ladies], BBC News Open Politics, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Qualifications===\n{{See also|Women in the House of Lords}}\nSeveral different qualifications apply for membership of the House of Lords. No person may sit in the House of Lords if under the age of 21.<ref name=\"standing_orders1\">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/ldstords.htm|title=The Standing Orders of the House of Lords relating to Public Business|accessdate=19 August 2010|date=8 April 2010|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> Furthermore, only United Kingdom, [[Irish nationality law|Irish]] and [[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth]] citizens may sit in the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/schedule/7/enacted |title=British Nationality Act 1981, Schedule 7 |accessdate=4 June 2017 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> The nationality restrictions were previously more stringent: under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], and prior to the [[British Nationality Act 1948]], only natural-born subjects qualified.\n\nAdditionally, some bankruptcy-related restrictions apply to members of the Upper House. A person may not sit in the House of Lords if he or she is the subject of a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (applicable in England and Wales only), or if he or she is adjudged bankrupt (in Northern Ireland), or if his or her estate is sequestered (in Scotland). A final restriction bars an individual convicted of [[high treason]] from sitting in the House of Lords until completing his or her full term of imprisonment. An exception applies, however, if the individual convicted of high treason receives a full pardon. Note that an individual serving a prison sentence for an offence other than high treason is ''not'' automatically disqualified.\n\nWomen were excluded from the House of Lords until the Life Peerages Act 1958,<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1958| chapter = 21| act = Life Peerages Act 1958}}</ref> passed to address the declining number of active members, made possible the creation of peerages for life. Women were immediately eligible and four were among the first life peers appointed. However, hereditary peeresses continued to be excluded until the passage of the Peerage Act 1963.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1963| chapter = 48| act = Peerage Act 1963}}</ref> Since the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999,<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1999| chapter = 34| act = House of Lords Act 1999}}</ref> hereditary peeresses remain eligible for election to the Upper House; there is one ([[Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar]]) among the 90 hereditary peers who continue to sit.\n\n====Cash for Peerages====\nThe [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1925| chapter = 72| act = Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925}}</ref> made it illegal for a peerage, or other honour, to be bought or sold. Nonetheless, there have been repeated allegations that life peerages (and thus membership of the House of Lords) have been made available to major political donors in exchange for donations. The most prominent case, the 2006 [[Cash for Honours]] scandal, saw a police investigation, with no charges being brought. A 2015 study found that of 303 people nominated for peerages in the period 2005\u201314, a total of 211 were former senior figures within politics (including former MPs), or were non-political appointments. Of the remaining 92 political appointments from outside public life, 27 had made significant donations to political parties. The authors concluded firstly that nominees from outside public life were much more likely to have made large gifts than peers nominated after prior political or public service. They also found that significant donors to parties were far more likely to be nominated for peerages than other party members.<ref>Mell, Radford and Thevoz: [http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Department-of-Economics-Discussion-Paper-Series/is-there-a-market-for-peerages-can-donations-buy-you-a-british-peerage-a-study-in-the-link-between-party-political-funding-and-peerage-nominations-2005 Is There a Market for Peerages? Can Donations Buy You a British Peerage? A Study in the Link Between Party Political Funding and Peerage Nominations, 2005-14] University of Oxford, pp 8, 13, 17, 22</ref>\n\n===Removal from House membership===\nTraditionally there was no mechanism by which members could resign or be removed from the House of Lords (compare the situation as regards [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation from the House of Commons]]). The Peerage Act 1963 permitted a person to disclaim their newly inherited peerage (within certain time limits); this meant that such a person could effectively renounce their membership of the Lords. This might be done in order to remain or become qualified to sit in the House of Commons, as in the case of [[Tony Benn]] (formerly the second [[Viscount Stansgate]]), who had campaigned for such a change.\n\nThe [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]]<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 2014| chapter = 24| act = House of Lords Reform Act 2014}}</ref> made provision for members' resignation from the House, removal for non-attendance, and automatic expulsion upon conviction for a serious criminal offence (if resulting in a jail sentence of at least one year). In June 2015, under the House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015,<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 2015| chapter = 14| act = House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015}}</ref> the House's Standing Orders may provide for the expulsion or suspension of a member upon a resolution of the House.\n\n==Officers==\nTraditionally the House of Lords did not elect its own speaker, unlike the House of Commons; rather, the ''ex officio'' presiding officer was the Lord Chancellor. With the passage of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the post of [[Lord Speaker]] was created, a position to which a peer is elected by the House and subsequently appointed by the Crown. The first Lord Speaker, elected on 4 May 2006, was [[Helene Hayman]], a former Labour peer. As the Speaker is expected to be an impartial presiding officer, Hayman resigned from the Labour Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/interviews/lordspeaker.cfm |title=Interview with the Lord Speaker |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=25 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126184819/http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/interviews/lordspeaker.cfm |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref> In 2011, [[Frances D'Souza]] was elected as the second Lord Speaker, replacing Hayman in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14190737|title=Baroness D'Souza elected Lord Speaker|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> D'Souza was in turn succeeded by [[Norman Fowler]] in September 2016, the incumbent Lord Speaker.\n\nThis reform of the post of Lord Chancellor was made due to the perceived constitutional anomalies inherent in the role. The Lord Chancellor was not only the Speaker of the House of Lords, but also a member of the Cabinet; his or her department, formerly the Lord Chancellor's Department, is now called the Ministry of Justice. The Lord Chancellor is no longer the head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Hitherto, the Lord Chancellor was part of all three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.\n\nThe overlap of the legislative and executive roles is a characteristic of the [[Westminster system]], as the entire cabinet consists of members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords; however, in June 2003, the Blair Government announced its intention to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor because of the office's mixed executive and judicial responsibilities. The abolition of the office was rejected by the House of Lords, and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was thus amended to preserve the office of Lord Chancellor. The Act no longer guarantees that the office holder of Lord Chancellor is the presiding officer of the House of Lords, and therefore allows the House of Lords to elect a speaker of their own.\n\n[[File:Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham by Charles Robert Leslie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Charles Pepys]] as Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor wore black and gold robes whilst presiding over the House of Lords.]]\nThe Lord Speaker may be replaced as presiding officer by one of his or her deputies. The [[Chairman of Committees (House of Lords)|Chairman of Committees]], the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees, and several Chairmen are all deputies to the Lord Speaker, and are all appointed by the House of Lords itself at the beginning of each session. By custom, the Crown appoints each Chairman, Principal Deputy Chairman and Deputy Chairman to the additional office of Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/deputy-speakers/|title=Deputy Speakers|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> There was previously no legal requirement that the Lord Chancellor or a Deputy Speaker be a member of the House of Lords (though the same has long been customary).\n\nWhilst presiding over the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor traditionally wore ceremonial black and gold robes. Robes of black and gold are now worn by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice in the House of Commons, on ceremonial occasions. This is no longer a requirement for the Lord Speaker except for State occasions outside of the chamber. The Speaker or Deputy Speaker sits on the [[Woolsack]], a large red seat stuffed with wool, at the front of the Lords Chamber.\n\nWhen the House of Lords resolves itself into committee (see below), the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees presides, not from the Woolsack, but from a chair at the Table of the House. The presiding officer has little power compared to the [[Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. He or she only acts as the mouthpiece of the House, performing duties such as announcing the results of votes. This is because, unlike in the House of Commons where all statements are directed to \"Mr/Madam Speaker\", in the House of Lords they are directed to \"My Lords\"; i.e., the entire body of the House.\n\nThe Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker cannot determine which members may speak, or discipline members for violating the rules of the House; these measures may be taken only by the House itself. Unlike the politically neutral Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chancellor and Deputy Speakers originally remained members of their respective parties, and were permitted to participate in debate; however, this is no longer true of the new role of Lord Speaker.\n\nAnother officer of the body is the Leader of the House of Lords, a peer selected by the Prime Minister. The Leader of the House is responsible for steering Government bills through the House of Lords, and is a member of the Cabinet. The Leader also advises the House on proper procedure when necessary, but such advice is merely informal, rather than official and binding. A Deputy Leader is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and takes the place of an absent or unavailable leader.\n\nThe [[Clerk of the Parliaments]] is the chief clerk and officer of the House of Lords (but is not a member of the House itself). The Clerk, who is appointed by the Crown, advises the presiding officer on the rules of the House, signs orders and official communications, endorses bills, and is the keeper of the official records of both Houses of Parliament. Moreover, the Clerk of the Parliaments is responsible for arranging by-elections of hereditary peers when necessary. The deputies of the Clerk of the Parliaments (the Clerk Assistant and the Reading Clerk) are appointed by the Lord Speaker, subject to the House's approval.\n\nThe [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]] is also an officer of the House; he takes his title from the symbol of his office, a black rod. Black Rod (as the Gentleman Usher is normally known) is responsible for ceremonial arrangements, is in charge of the House's doorkeepers, and may (upon the order of the House) take action to end disorder or disturbance in the Chamber. Black Rod also holds the office of [[Serjeant-at-Arms]] of the House of Lords, and in this capacity attends upon the Lord Speaker. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod's duties may be delegated to the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod or to the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms.\n\n==Procedure==\n[[File:Chamber of the House of Lords benches.jpg|thumb|right|Benches in the chamber are coloured red. In contrast, the House of Commons is decorated in green.]]\n[[File:Thrones in the House of Lords c1902.jpg|thumb|The royal thrones, c.&nbsp;1902.

The Lords Chamber is lavishly decorated, in contrast with the more modestly furnished Commons Chamber. Benches in the Lords Chamber are coloured red. The Woolsack is at the front of the Chamber; the Government sit on benches on the right of the Woolsack, while members of the Opposition sit on the left. Crossbenchers, sit on the benches immediately opposite the Woolsack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a3|title=House of Lords briefing paper, A Guide to Business, page 3|accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Lords Chamber is the site of many formal ceremonies, the most famous of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], held at the beginning of each new parliamentary session. During the State Opening, the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]], seated on the Throne in the Lords Chamber and in the presence of both Houses of Parliament, delivers a speech outlining the Government's agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session.\n\nIn the House of Lords, members need not seek the recognition of the presiding officer before speaking, as is done in the House of Commons. If two or more Lords simultaneously rise to speak, the House decides which one is to be heard by acclamation, or, if necessary, by voting on a motion. Often, however, the Leader of the House will suggest an order, which is thereafter generally followed. Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole (\"My Lords\") rather than to the presiding officer alone (as is the custom in the Lower House). Members may not refer to each other in the second person (as \"you\"), but rather use third person forms such as \"the noble Duke\", \"the noble Earl\", \"the noble Lord\", \"my noble friend\", \"The most Reverend Primate\", etc.\n\nEach member may make no more than one speech on a motion, except that the mover of the motion may make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end. Speeches are not subject to any time limits in the House; however, the House may put an end to a speech by approving a motion \"that the noble Lord be no longer heard\". It is also possible for the House to end the debate entirely, by approving a motion \"that the Question be now put\". This procedure is known as [[cloture|Closure]], and is extremely rare.\n\nOnce all speeches on a motion have concluded, or Closure invoked, the motion may be put to a vote. The House first votes by [[voice vote]]; the Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and the Lords respond either \"content\" (in favour of the motion) or \"not content\" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his assessment is challenged by any Lord, a recorded vote known as a [[division (vote)|division]] follows.\n\nMembers of the House enter one of two lobbies (the ''content'' lobby or the ''not-content'' lobby) on either side of the Chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. At each lobby are two Tellers (themselves members of the House) who count the votes of the Lords. The Lord Speaker may not take part in the vote. Once the division concludes, the Tellers provide the results thereof to the presiding officer, who then announces them to the House.\n\nIf there is an equality of votes, the motion is decided according to the following principles: legislation may proceed in its present form, unless there is a majority in favour of amending or rejecting it; any other motions are rejected, unless there is a majority in favour of approving it. The quorum of the House of Lords is just three members for a general or procedural vote, and 30 members for a vote on legislation. If fewer than three or 30 members (as appropriate) are present, the division is invalid.\n\n===Disciplinary powers===\nBy contrast with the House of Commons, the House of Lords has not until recently had an established procedure for putting sanctions on its members. When a [[2009 cash for influence scandal|cash for influence scandal]] was referred to the Committee of Privileges in January 2009, the Leader of the House of Lords also asked the Privileges Committee to report on what sanctions the House had against its members.<ref name=\"Reference to committee\">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/87/8703.htm|title=The Powers of the House of Lords in respect of its Members|publisher=House of Lords, Committee for Privileges|at=paragraph 2}}</ref> After seeking advice from the Attorney General for England and Wales and the former Lord Chancellor [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|James, Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], the committee decided that the House \"possessed an inherent power\" to suspend errant members, although not to withhold a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]] nor to expel a member permanently.<ref name=\"Powers of suspension\">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/87/8703.htm|title=The Powers of the House of Lords in respect of its Members|publisher=House of Lords, Committee for Privileges|at=paragraph 8}}</ref> When the House subsequently suspended [[Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott|Peter, Lord Truscott]] and [[Tom Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn|Tom, Lord Taylor of Blackburn]] for their role in the scandal, they were the first to meet this fate since 1642.<ref name=\"Taylor and Truscott suspended\">{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Sparrow,|title='Sullied' members suspend two peers in first case since 1642|work=The Guardian|date=21 May 2009|page=6}}</ref>\n\nRecent changes have expanded the disciplinary powers of the House. Section 3 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 now provides that any member of the House of Lords convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year loses their seat. The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 allows the House to set up procedures to suspend, and to expel, its members.\n\n====Regulation of behaviour in the chamber====\nThere are two motions which have grown up through custom and practice and which govern questionable conduct within the House. They are brought into play by a member standing up, possibly intervening on another member, and moving the motion without notice. When the debate is getting excessively heated, it is open to a member to move \"that the Standing Order on Asperity of Speech be read by the Clerk\". The motion can be debated,<ref name=\"Asperity of speech\">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso06.htm#a61|title=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the proceedings of the House of Lords|date=October 2006|at=paragraph 4.58|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> but if agreed by the House, the Clerk of the Parliaments will read out Standing Order 33 which provides \"That all personal, sharp, or taxing speeches be forborn\".<ref name=\"Standing Order 32\">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/105/105.pdf|title=The Standing Orders of the House of Lords|date=23 April 2015|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> The Journals of the House of Lords record only four instances on which the House has ordered the Standing Order to be read since the procedure was invented in 1871.<ref name=\"Asperity instances\">See Lords Journal vol.

It is made up of all Members of the House of Lords allowing any Member to contribute to debates if he or she chooses to do so and allows for more flexible rules of procedure. It is presided over by the Chairman of Committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso11.htm#a134|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=138|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe term committee is also used to describe Grand Committee, where the same rules of procedure apply as in the main chamber, except that no divisions may take place. For this reason, business that is discussed in Grand Committee is usually uncontroversial and likely to be agreed unanimously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso06.htm#a34|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=40|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nPublic bills may also be committed to pre-legislative committees. A pre-legislative Committee is specifically constituted for a particular bill. These committees are established in advance of the bill being laid before either the House of Lords or the House of Commons and can take evidence from the public. Such committees are rare and do not replace any of the usual stages of a bill, including committee stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso11.htm#a112|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=128|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Lords also has 15 [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committees]]. Typically, these are ''sessional committees'', meaning that their members are appointed by the House at the beginning of each session, and continue to serve until the next parliamentary session begins. In practice, these are often permanent committees, which are re-established during every session. These committees are typically empowered to make reports to the House \"from time to time\", that is, whenever they wish. Other committees are ''ad-hoc committees'', which are set up to investigate a specific issue. When they are set up by a motion in the House, the motion will set a deadline by which the Committee must report. After this date, the Committee will cease to exist unless it is granted an extension. One example of this is the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/public-services-committee/role/|title=Ad-Hoc Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> The House of Lords may appoint a chairman for a committee; if it does not do so, the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees may preside instead. Most of the Select Committees are also granted the power to co-opt members, such as the [[European Union Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso14.htm#a249|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=214|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> The primary function of Select Committees is to scrutinise and investigate Government activities; to fulfil these aims, they are permitted to hold hearings and collect evidence. Bills may be referred to Select Committees, but are more often sent to the Committee of the Whole House and Grand Committees.\n\nThe committee system of the House of Lords also includes several Domestic Committees, which supervise or consider the House's procedures and administration. One of the Domestic Committees is the Committee of Selection, which is responsible for assigning members to many of the House's other committees.\n\n==Current composition==\n{{Main|Members of the

But there need not be a [[Homotopy|continuous deformation]] for two spaces to be homeomorphic \u2014 only a continuous mapping with a continuous inverse function.]]\nIn the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''homeomorphism''' or '''topological isomorphism''' or '''bi continuous function''' is a [[Continuous function#Continuous functions between topological spaces|continuous function]] between [[topological space]]s that has a continuous [[inverse function]]. Homeomorphisms are the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category of topological spaces]]&mdash;that is, they are the [[map (mathematics)|mappings]] that preserve all the [[topological property|topological properties]] of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called '''homeomorphic''', and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word ''homeomorphism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''[[wikt:\u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2|\u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (''homoios'') = similar or same and ''[[wikt:\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae|\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae]]'' (''morph\u0113'') = shape, form, introduced to mathematics by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serge.mehl.free.fr/anx/ana_situs.html|title=Analysis Situs selon Poincar\u00e9 (1895)|author=|date=|website=serge.mehl.free.fr|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611022329/http://serge.mehl.free.fr/anx/ana_situs.html|archivedate=11 June 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gamelin |first=T.

Thus, a [[square (geometry)|square]] and a [[circle]] are homeomorphic to each other, but a [[sphere]] and a [[torus]] are not. However, this description can be misleading. Some continuous deformations are not homeomorphisms, such as the deformation of a line into a point. Some homeomorphisms are not continuous deformations, such as the homeomorphism between a [[trefoil knot]] and a circle.\n\nAn often-repeated [[mathematical joke]] is that topologists can't tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut,<ref>{{cite book|title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach.

If such a function exists, we say <math>(X,\\mathcal{T}_X)</math> and <math>(Y,\\mathcal{T}_Y)</math> are '''homeomorphic'''. A '''self-homeomorphism''' is a homeomorphism of a topological space and itself. The homeomorphisms form an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all topological spaces. The resulting [[equivalence class]]es are called '''homeomorphism classes'''.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:Blue Trefoil Knot.png|thumb|right|240|A [[trefoil knot]] is homeomorphic to a torus, but not [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopic]] in  '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Continuous mappings are not always realizable as deformations.]]\n* The open [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math display=\"inline\">(a,b)</math> is homeomorphic to the [[real number]]s <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{R}</math> for any <math display=\"inline\">a < b</math>. (In this case, a bicontinuous forward mapping is given by <math display=\"inline\">f(x) = \\frac{1}{a-x} + \\frac{1}{b-x} </math> while other such mappings are given by scaled and translated versions of the {{math|tan}} or {{math|arg tanh}} functions).\n* The unit 2-[[ball (mathematics)|disc]] <math display=\"inline\">D^2</math> and the [[unit square]] in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> are homeomorphic; since the unit disc can be deformed into the unit square. An example of a bicontinuous mapping from the square to the disc is, in [[polar coordinates]], <math>(\\rho, \\theta) \\mapsto \\left( \\rho \\max(|\\cos \\theta|, |\\sin \\theta|), \\theta\\right)</math>.\n* The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[differentiable function]] is homeomorphic to the [[domain of a function|domain]] of the function.\n* A differentiable [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of a [[curve]] is a homeomorphism between the domain of the parametrization and the curve.\n* A [[chart (topology)|chart]] of a [[manifold]] is an homeomorphism between an [[open subset]] of the manifold and an open subset of a [[Euclidean space]].\n* The [[stereographic projection]] is a homeomorphism between the unit sphere in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> with a single point removed and the set of all points in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (a 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]). \n* If <math>G</math> is a [[topological group]], its inversion map <math>x \\mapsto x^{-1}</math> is a homeomorphism. Also, for any <math>x \\in G</math>, the left translation <math>y \\mapsto xy</math>, the right translation <math>y \\mapsto yx</math>, and the inner automorphism <math>y \\mapsto xyx^{-1}</math> are homeomorphisms.\n\n===Non-examples===\n* '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> and '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> are not homeomorphic for {{nowrap|1=''m'' &ne; ''n''.}}\n* The Euclidean [[real line]] is not homeomorphic to the unit circle as a subspace of '''R'''<sup>''2''</sup>, since the unit circle is [[Compact space|compact]] as a subspace of Euclidean '''R'''<sup>''2''</sup> but the real line is not compact.\n\n==Notes==\nThe third requirement, that <math display=\"inline\">f^{-1}</math> be continuous, is essential. Consider for instance the function <math display=\"inline\">f : [0,2\\pi) \\to S^1</math> (the [[unit circle]] in <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbb{R}^2</math>) defined by<math display=\"inline\">f(\\phi) = (\\cos\\phi,\\sin\\phi)</math>. This function is bijective and continuous, but not a homeomorphism (<math display=\"inline\">S^1</math> is compact but <math display=\"inline\">[0,2\\pi)</math> is not). The function <math display=\"inline\">f^{-1}</math> is not continuous at the point <math display=\"inline\">(1,0)</math>, because although <math display=\"inline\">f^{-1}</math> maps <math display=\"inline\">(1,0)</math> to <math display=\"inline\">0</math>, any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of this point also includes points that the function maps close to <math display=\"inline\">2\\pi</math>, but the points it maps to numbers in between lie outside the neighbourhood.<ref>V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4, Jussi: ''Topologia I'', Limes RY 1999, p. 63. {{ISBN|951-745-184-9}}.</ref>\n\nHomeomorphisms are the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category of topological spaces]]. As such, the composition of two homeomorphisms is again a homeomorphism, and the set of all self-homeomorphisms <math display=\"inline\">X \\to X</math> forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''[[homeomorphism group]]''' of ''X'', often denoted <math display=\"inline\">\\text{Homeo}(X)</math>.

For example, if one of them is [[compact space|compact]], then the other is as well; if one of them is [[connectedness|connected]], then the other is as well; if one of them is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then the other is as well; their [[homotopy]] and [[homology group]]s will coincide. Note however that this does not extend to properties defined via a [[metric space|metric]]; there are metric spaces that are homeomorphic even though one of them is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and the other is not.\n* A homeomorphism is simultaneously an [[open mapping]] and a [[closed mapping]]; that is, it maps [[open set]]s to open sets and [[closed set]]s to closed sets.\n* Every self-homeomorphism in <math>S^1</math> can be extended to a self-homeomorphism of the whole disk <math>D^2</math> ([[Alexander's trick]]).\n\n==Informal discussion==\nThe intuitive criterion of stretching, bending, cutting and gluing back together takes a certain amount of practice to apply correctly&mdash;it may not be obvious from the description above that deforming a [[line segment]] to a point is impermissible, for instance. It is thus important to realize that it is the formal definition given above that counts. In this case, for example, the line segment possesses infinitely many points, and therefore cannot be put into a bijection with a set containing only a finite number of points, including a single point.\n\nThis characterization of a homeomorphism often leads to a confusion with the concept of [[homotopy]], which is actually ''defined'' as a continuous deformation, but from one ''function'' to another, rather than one space to another. In the case of a homeomorphism, envisioning a continuous deformation is a mental tool for keeping track of which points on space ''X'' correspond to which points on ''Y''&mdash;one just follows them as ''X'' deforms. In the case of homotopy, the continuous deformation from one map to the other is of the essence, and it is also less restrictive, since none of the maps involved need to be one-to-one or onto. Homotopy does lead to a relation on spaces: [[homotopy equivalence]].\n\nThere is a name for the kind of deformation involved in visualizing a homeomorphism. It is (except when cutting and regluing are required) an [[homotopy|isotopy]] between the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' and the homeomorphism from ''X'' to ''Y''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Local homeomorphism]]\n*[[Diffeomorphism]]\n*[[Uniform isomorphism]] is an isomorphism between [[uniform spaces]]\n*[[Isometric isomorphism]] is an isomorphism between [[metric spaces]]\n*[[Homeomorphism group]]\n*[[Dehn twist]]\n*[[Homeomorphism (graph theory)]] (closely related to graph subdivision)\n*[[Homotopy#Isotopy]]\n*[[Mapping class group]]\n*[[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]\n*[[Universal homeomorphism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{springer|title=Homeomorphism|id=p/h047600}}\n*{{planetmath reference|id=912|title=Homeomorphism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Homeomorphisms| ]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]", "sha1": "f4yyu8pgrkf4pbl5vwjgr3eipbj92bm"}}, {"title": "Hvergelmir", "ns": "0", "id": "13661", "revision": {"id": "793475511", "parentid": "785940703", "timestamp": "2017-08-02T00:06:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "TAnthony", "id": "1808194"}, "comment": "/* Notes */Correct unknown or deprecated {{Reflist}} parameters (the template is now responsive) and genfixes using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In [[Norse mythology]], '''Hvergelmir''' ([[Old Norse]] \"bubbling boiling spring\"<ref name=\"ORCHARD-93\">Orchard (1997:93)</ref>) is a major spring.

It states that in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nThe Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] over ZF ([[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the '''Hausdorff maximality theorem''' or the '''Kuratowski lemma''' (Kelley 1955:33).\n\n==Statement==\n\nThe Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.\n\nAn equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nTo prove that it follows from the original form, let ''A'' be a [[poset]]. Then <math>\\varnothing</math> is a totally ordered subset of ''A'', hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing <math>\\varnothing</math>, in particular ''A'' contains a maximal totally ordered subset.\n\nFor the converse direction, let ''A'' be a partially ordered set and ''T'' a totally ordered subset of ''A''. Then\n:<math>\\{S\\mid T\\subseteq S\\subseteq A\\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\\}</math>\nis partially ordered by set inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math>, therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset ''P''. Then the set <math>M=\\bigcup P</math> satisfies the desired properties.\n\nThe proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.\n\n== Examples ==\n'''EXAMPLE 1.'''    If ''A'' is any collection of sets, the relation \"is a proper subset of\" is a [[strict partial order]] on ''A''. Suppose that ''A'' is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of ''A'' consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.\n\n'''EXAMPLE 2.''' If (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) and (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) are two points of the plane \u211d<sup>2</sup>, define (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) < (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)\n\nif y<sub>0</sub> = y<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> < x<sub>1</sub>. This is a partial ordering of \u211d<sup>2</sup> under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in \u211d<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==References==\n* [[John L.

Hel is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in ''[[Heimskringla]]'' and ''[[Egils saga]]'' that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. An episode in the Latin work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', written in the 12th century by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various [[Migration Period]] [[bracteate]]s.\n\nIn the ''Poetic Edda'', ''Prose Edda'', and ''Heimskringla'', Hel is referred to as a daughter of [[Loki]]. In the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Hel is described as having been appointed by the god [[Odin]] as ruler of a realm of the same name, located in [[Niflheim]]. In the same source, her appearance is described as half blue and half flesh-coloured and further as having a gloomy, downcast appearance. The ''Prose Edda'' details that Hel rules over vast mansions with many servants in her underworld realm and plays a key role in the attempted resurrection of the god [[Baldr]].\n\nScholarly theories have been proposed about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th-century ''[[Old English Gospel of Nicodemus]]'' and Old Norse ''[[Bartholomeus saga postola]]'', that she may have been considered a [[goddess]] with potential [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] parallels in [[Bhavani]], [[Kali]], and [[Mahakali]] or that Hel may have become a being only as a late personification of the location of the same name.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Old Norse feminine proper noun ''Hel'' is identical to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse ''Hel''. The word has [[cognate]]s in all branches of the [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old English]] ''hell'' (and thus Modern English ''hell''), [[Old Frisian]] ''helle'', [[Old Saxon]] ''hellia'', [[Old High German]] ''hella'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''halja''. All forms ultimately derive from the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] feminine noun *''xalj\u014d'' or *''halj\u014d'' ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the [[Indo-European ablaut|o-grade form]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''kel-'', *''kol''-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.<ref name=\"HEL-NOUN\">For discussion and analysis, see Orel (2003:156) and Watkins (2000:38).</ref>\n\nThe term is etymologically related to Modern English ''hall'' and therefore also ''[[Valhalla]]'', an afterlife 'hall of the slain' in Norse Mythology. ''Hall'' and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic *''hall\u014d'' 'covered place, hall', from Proto-Indo-European *''kol-''.<ref name=\"HELL-HALL\">This is highlighted in Watkins (2000:38).</ref>\n\nRelated early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic *''xalja-r\u016bn\u014d(n)'', a feminine compound noun, and *''xalja-w\u012btjan'', a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *''haliurunnae'' (attested by [[Jordanes]]; according to philologist [[Vladimir Orel]], meaning '[[witchcraft|witches]]'), Old English ''helle-r\u00fane'' ('sorceress, [[necromancer]]', according to Orel), and Old High German ''helli-r\u016bna'' 'magic'. The compound is composed of two elements: *''xalj\u014d'' (*''halj\u014d'') and *''r\u016bn\u014d'', the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English ''[[runic alphabet|rune]]''.<ref name=\"HELL-RUNE\">See discussion at Orel (2003:155-156 & 310).</ref> The second element in the Gothic ''haliurunnae'' may however instead be an agent noun from the verb ''rinnan'' (\"to run, go\"), which would make its literal meaning \"one who travels to the netherworld\".<ref>Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur (1973) pp. 70-71.</ref><ref>Lehmann, Winfred, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary (1986)</ref>)\n\nProto-Germanic *''xalja-w\u012btjan'' (or *''halja-w\u012btjan'') is reconstructed from Old Norse ''hel-v\u00edti'' 'hell', Old English ''helle-w\u00edte'' 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon ''helli-w\u012bti'' 'hell', and the Middle High German feminine noun ''helle-w\u012bze''. The compound is a compound of *''xalj\u014d'' (discussed above) and *''w\u012btjan'' (reconstructed from forms such as Old English ''witt'' 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon ''gewit'' 'understanding', and Gothic ''un-witi'' 'foolishness, understanding').<ref name=\"HELV\u00cdTI\">Orel (2003:156 & 464).</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\n===''Poetic Edda''===\nThe ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, features various poems that mention Hel.

In chapter 34 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Hel is listed by [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] as one of the three children of [[Loki]] and [[Angrbo\u00f0a]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and Hel. High continues that, once the gods found that these three children are being brought up in the land of [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], and when the gods \"traced prophecies that from these siblings great mischief and disaster would arise for them\" then the gods expected a lot of trouble from the three children, partially due to the nature of the mother of the children, yet worse so due to the nature of their father.<ref name=\"FAULKES26-27\">Faulkes (1995:26\u201327).</ref>\n\nHigh says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him. Upon their arrival, Odin threw J\u00f6rmungandr into \"that deep sea that lies round all lands,\" Odin threw Hel into [[Niflheim]], and bestowed upon her authority over [[Norse cosmology|nine worlds]], in that she must \"administer board and lodging to those sent to her, and that is those who die of sickness or old age.\" High details that in this realm Hel has \"great Mansions\" with extremely high walls and immense gates, a hall called [[\u00c9lj\u00fa\u00f0nir]], a dish called \"Hunger,\" a knife called \"Famine,\" the servant Ganglati (Old Norse \"lazy walker\"<ref name=\"ORCHARD79\">Orchard (1997:79).</ref>), the serving-maid Gangl\u00f6t (also \"lazy walker\"<ref name=\"ORCHARD79\" />), the entrance threshold \"Stumbling-block,\" the bed \"Sick-bed,\" and the curtains \"Gleaming-bale.\" High describes Hel as \"half black and half flesh-coloured,\" adding that this makes her easily recognizable, and furthermore that Hel is \"rather downcast and fierce-looking.\"<ref name=\"FAULKES27\">Faulkes (1995:27).</ref>\n\nIn chapter 49, High describes the events surrounding the death of the god [[Baldr]]. The goddess [[Frigg]] asks who among the [[\u00c6sir]] will earn \"all her love and favour\" by riding to Hel, the location, to try to find Baldr, and offer Hel herself a ransom. The god [[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r]] volunteers and sets off upon the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]] to Hel. Herm\u00f3\u00f0r arrives in Hel's hall, finds his brother Baldr there, and stays the night. The next morning, Herm\u00f3\u00f0r begs Hel to allow Baldr to ride home with him, and tells her about the great weeping the \u00c6sir have done upon Baldr's death.<ref name=\"FAULKES49-50\">Faulkes (1995:49\u201350).</ref> Hel says the love people have for Baldr that Herm\u00f3\u00f0r has claimed must be tested, stating:\n<blockquote>\nIf all things in the world, alive or dead, weep for him, then he will be allowed to return to the \u00c6sir.

A poem from the 9th-century ''[[Ynglingatal]]'' that forms the basis of ''Ynglinga saga'' is then quoted that describes Hel's taking of Dyggvi:\n<blockquote>\n:I doubt not\n:but Dyggvi's corpse\n:Hel does hold\n:to whore with him;\n:for Ulf's sib\n:a scion of kings\n:by right should\n:caress in death:\n:to love lured\n:Loki's sister\n:[[Yngvi]]'s heir\n:o'er all Sweden.<ref name=\"HOLLANDER20\">Hollander (2007:20).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn chapter 45, a section from ''Ynglingatal'' is given which refers to Hel as \"[[Bowl barrow|howe]]s'-warder\" (meaning \"guardian of the graves\") and as taking King [[Halfdan Hvitbeinn]] from life.<ref name=\"HOLLANDER46\">Hollander (2007:46).</ref> In chapter 46, King [[Eystein Halfdansson]] dies by being knocked overboard by a sail yard.

The saga attributes the poem to 10th century skald [[Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson]], and writes that it was composed by Egill after the death of his son Gunnar. The final stanza of the poem contains a mention of Hel, though not by name:\n<blockquote>\n:Now my course is tough:\n:Death, close sister\n:of Odin's enemy\n:stands on the ness:\n:with resolution\n:and without remorse\n:I will gladly\n:await my own.<ref name=SCUDDER159>Scudder (2001:159).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Gesta Danorum''===\nIn the account of Baldr's death in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' early 13th century work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', the dying Baldr has a dream visitation from [[Proserpina]] (here translated as \"the goddess of death\"):\n<blockquote>\nThe following night the goddess of death appeared to him in a dream standing at his side, and declared that in three days time she would clasp him in her arms. It was no idle vision, for after three days the acute pain of his injury brought his end.<ref>Fisher (1999:I 75).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nScholars have assumed that Saxo used Proserpina as a goddess equivalent to the Norse Hel.<ref>Davidson (1999:II 356); Grimm (2004:314).</ref>\n\n==Archaeological record==\nIt has been suggested that several [[bracteate|imitation medallions and bracteates]] of the [[Migration Period]] (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.<ref name=PESCH67>Pesch (2002:67).</ref>\n\nSome B-class bracteates showing three godly figures have been interpreted as depicting Baldr's death, the best known of these is the Fakse bracteate.

Regarding Seo Hell in the ''Old English Gospel of Nicodemus'', Michael Bell states that \"her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the [[Holda|Frau Holle]] of German folklore, to say nothing of underworld goddesses in other cultures\" yet adds that \"the possibility that these genders ''are'' merely grammatical is strengthened by the fact that an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neutral (Old Norse ''\u00feat helv\u00edti'').\"<ref name=BELL263>Bell (1983:263).</ref>\n\n===''Bartholomeus saga postola''===\nThe [[Old Norse]] ''[[Bartholomeus saga postola]]'', an account of the life of [[Saint Bartholomew]] dating from the 13th century, mentions a \"Queen Hel.\" In the story, a devil is hiding within a pagan idol, and bound by Bartholomew's spiritual powers to acknowledge himself and confess, the devil refers to [[Jesus]] as the one which \"made war on Hel our queen\" (Old Norse ''heria\u00f0i a Hel drottning vara''). \"Queen Hel\" is not mentioned elsewhere in the saga.<ref name=BELL263-264>Bell (1983:263\u2013264).</ref>\n\nMichael Bell says that while Hel \"might at first appear to be identical with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld\" as described in chapter 34 of ''Gylfaginning'', \"in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of ''Nicodemus'' she casts quite a different a shadow,\" and that in  ''Bartholomeus saga postola'' \"she is clearly the queen of the Christian, not pagan, underworld.\"<ref name=BELL265>Bell (1983:265).</ref>\n\n===Origins and development===\n[[Jacob Grimm]] theorized that Hel (whom he refers to here as ''Halja'', the theorized [[Proto-Germanic]] form of the term) is essentially an \"image of a greedy, unrestoring, female deity\" and that \"the higher we are allowed to penetrate into our antiquities, the less hellish and more godlike may ''Halja'' appear. Of this we have a particularly strong guarantee in her affinity to the [[Hinduism|Indian]] [[Bhavani]], who travels about and bathes like [[Nerthus]] and [[Holda]], but is likewise called ''[[Kali]]'' or ''[[Mahakali]]'', the great ''black'' goddess. In the underworld she is supposed to sit in judgment on souls. This office, the similar name and the black hue [...] make her exceedingly like ''Halja''. And ''Halja'' is one of the oldest and commonest conceptions of our heathenism.\"<ref name=GRIMM315>Grimm (1882:315).</ref>\n\nGrimm theorizes that the [[Helhest]], a three legged-horse that roams the countryside \"as a harbinger of plague and pestilence\" in [[Denmark|Danish]] folklore, was originally the steed of the goddess Hel, and that on this steed Hel roamed the land \"picking up the dead that were her due.\" In addition, Grimm says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel, with which Hel made journeys.<ref name=GRIMM314>Grimm (1882:314).</ref> Grimm says that Hel is an example of a \"half-goddess;\" \"one who cannot be shown to be either wife or daughter of a god, and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities\" and that \"half-goddesses\" stand higher than \"half-gods\" in Germanic mythology.<ref name=GRIMM397>Grimm (1882:397).</ref>\n\n[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1948) states that Hel \"as a goddess\" in surviving sources seems to belong to a genre of literary personification, that the word ''hel'' is generally \"used simply to signify death or the grave,\" and that the word often appears as the equivalent to the English 'death,' which Davidson states \"naturally lends itself to personification by poets.\" Davidson explains that \"whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question,\" but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give any reason to believe so. Davidson adds that, on the other hand, various other examples of \"certain supernatural women\" connected with death are to be found in sources for Norse mythology, that they \"seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors,\" and that the depiction of Hel \"as a goddess\" in ''Gylfaginning'' \"might well owe something to these.\"<ref name=\"ELLIS90\">Ellis (1968:84).</ref>\n\nIn a later work (1998), Davidson states that the description of Hel found in chapter 33 of ''Gylfaginning'' \"hardly suggests a goddess.\" Davidson adds that \"yet this is not the impression given in the account of Hermod's ride to Hel later in ''Gylfaginning'' (49)\" and points out that here Hel \"[speaks] with authority as ruler of the underworld\" and that from her realm \"gifts are sent back to [[Frigg]] and [[Fulla]] by Balder's wife [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] as from a friendly kingdom.\" Davidson posits that Snorri may have \"earlier turned the goddess of death into an allegorical figure, just as he made Hel, the underworld of [[Shade (mythology)|shades]], a place 'where wicked men go,' like the Christian Hell (''Gylfaginning'' 3).\" Davidson continues that:\n<blockquote>\nOn the other hand, a goddess of death who represents the horrors of slaughter and decay is something well known elsewhere; the figure of Kali in India is an outstanding example. Like Snorri's Hel, she is terrifying to in appearance, black or dark in colour, usually naked, adorned with severed heads or arms or the corpses of children, her lips smeared with blood. She haunts the battlefield or cremation ground and squats on corpses. Yet for all this she is \"the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees who approach her as their mother\" [...].<ref name=DAVIDSON178>Davidson (1998:178) quoting 'the recipient ...' from Kinsley (1989:116).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nDavidson further compares to early attestations of the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] goddesses [[Badb]] (Davidson points to the description of Badb from ''The Destruction of Da Choca's Hostel'' where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle, has a large mouth, is dark in color, and has gray hair falling over her shoulders, or, alternatively, \"as a red figure on the edge of the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die\") and [[Morr\u00edgan|The Morr\u00edgan]]. Davidson concludes that, in these examples, \"here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention.\"<ref name=DAVIDSON179>Davidson (1998:179).</ref>\n\n[[John Lindow]] states that most details about Hel, as a figure, are not found outside of Snorri's writing in ''Gylfaginning'', and says that when older skaldic poetry \"says that people are 'in' rather than 'with' Hel, we are clearly dealing with a place rather than a person, and this is assumed to be the older conception,\" that the noun and place ''Hel'' likely originally simply meant \"grave,\" and that \"the personification came later.\"<ref name=\"LINDOW172\">Lindow (1997:172).</ref> He also draws a parallel between the personified Hel's banishment to the underworld and the binding of Fenrir as part of a recurring theme of the [[bound monster]], where an enemy of the gods is bound but destined to break free at Ragnarok.<ref name=LINDOW82-83>Lindow (2001:82-83).</ref>  [[Rudolf Simek]] theorizes that the figure of Hel is \"probably a very late personification of the underworld Hel,\" and says that \"the first scriptures using the goddess Hel are found at the end of the 10th and in the 11th centuries.\" Simek states that the allegorical description of Hel's house in ''Gylfaginning'' \"clearly stands in the Christian tradition,\" and that \"on the whole nothing speaks in favour of there being a belief in Hel in pre-Christian times.\"<ref name=\"SIMEK138\">Simek (2007:138).</ref> However, Simek also cites Hel as possibly appearing as one of three figures appearing together on Migration Period B-bracteates.<ref name=SIMEK44>Simek (2007:44).</ref>\n\n==Modern influence==\nIn January 2017, the [[Icelandic Naming Committee]] ruled that parents could not name their child ''Hel'' \"on the grounds that the name would cause the child significant distress and trouble as it grows up\".<ref>Staff A (2017). \"Naming committee stops parents from naming daughter after goddess of the underworld\".

When part of the London church, of which [[Francis Johnson (1562-1618)|Francis Johnson]] (then in prison) was pastor, reassembled in Amsterdam, Ainsworth was chosen as their doctor or teacher. In 1596 he drew up a confession of their faith, reissued in [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1598 and dedicated to the various universities of Europe (including [[St Andrews]], [[Scotland]]). Johnson joined his flock in 1597, and in 1604 he and Ainsworth composed ''An Apology or Defence of such true Christians as are commonly but unjustly called [[Brownists]]''.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ainsworth, Henry|volume=1|pages=440\u2013441}}</ref>\n\nOrganizing the church was not easy and dissension was rife. Though often involved in controversy, Ainsworth was not arrogant, but was a steadfast and cultured champion of the principles represented by the early Congregationalists. Amid all the controversy, he steadily pursued his studies. The combination was so unique that some have mistaken him for two different individuals. Confusion has also been occasioned through his friendly controversy with one John Ainsworth, who left the [[Anglican]] for the [[Roman Catholic]] church.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1610 Ainsworth was forced reluctantly to withdraw, with a large part of their church, from Johnson and those who adhered to him. A difference of principle as to the church's right to revise its officers' decisions had been growing between them; Ainsworth taking the more [[congregationalist church governance|Congregational]] view. In spirit he remained a man of peace.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe died in 1622 in Amsterdam.\n\n==Works==\n\nIn 1608 Ainsworth answered [[Richard Bernard]]'s ''The Separatist Schisme'', but his greatest minor work in this field was his reply to [[John Smyth (1570-1612)|John Smyth]] (commonly called \"the Se-Baptist\"), entitled ''Defence of Holy Scripture, Worship and Ministry used in the Christian Churches separated from [[Antichrist]], against the Challenges, Cavils and Contradictions of Mr Smyth'' (1609).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHis scholarly works include his ''Annotations''\u2014on ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' (1616); ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' (1617); ''[[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]]'' (1618); ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' (1619); ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' (1619); ''[[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]'' (including a metrical version, 1612); and the ''[[Song of Solomon]]'' (1623). These were collected in folio in 1627. From the outset the ''Annotations'' took a commanding place, especially among continental scholars, establishing a scholarly tradition for English nonconformity.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHis publication of Psalms, ''The Book of Psalmes:  Englished both in Prose and Metre with Annotations'' (Amsterdam, 1612), which includes thirty-nine separate [[texture (music)|monophonic]] psalm tunes, constituted the [[Ainsworth Psalter]], the only book of music brought to [[New England]] in 1620 by the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim]] settlers. Although its content was later reworked into the [[Bay Psalm Book]], it had an important influence on the early development of American [[psalmody]].\n\nAinsworth died in 1622, or early in 1623, for in that year was published his ''Seasonable Discourse, or a Censure upon a Dialogue of the [[Anabaptist]]s'', in which the editor speaks of him as a departed worthy.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n* {{Citation  | last =Ainsworth  | first =Henry  | title =Annotations on the Pentateuch or the five books of Moses ; the Psalms of David and the Song of Solomon : with a memoir of the author   | place =Glasgow  | publisher =Blackie & Son  | volume =I  | year =1843|edition=reprint| chapterurl = | url =https://archive.org/details/annotationsonpen01ains  |ol=13993511M|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation | last =Ainsworth | first =Henry  | title = Annotations upon the Pentateuch Or the Five Books of Moses; the Psalms of David; and the Song of Solomon | place =  Glasgow| publisher =Blackie & Son | volume =II | year = 1843|edition=reprint| chapterurl = | url = https://archive.org/details/annotationsupon00ainsgoog|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation  | last =Ainsworth  | first =Henry  | title =Annotations on the Pentateuch or the five books of Moses ; the Psalms of David and the Song of Solomon : with a memoir of the author   | place =Glasgow  | publisher =Blackie & Son  | volume =II  | year =1843|edition=reprint| chapterurl = | url =https://archive.org/details/annotationsonpen02ains  |ol=13993511M|ref=none}}\n* {{Citation  | last =Ainsworth  | first =Henry  | title =Annotations on the Pentateuch or the five books of Moses ; the Psalms of David and the Song of Solomon : with a memoir of the author  | place =Glasgow  | publisher =Blackie & Son  | volume =II  | year =1846  | chapterurl = | url =https://archive.org/details/annotationsonpen184602ains  |ol=13993513M|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation  | last =Ainsworth  | first =Henry  | title =An Animadversion to Mr. Richard Clyftons Advertisement  | place =Amsterdam  | publisher =Giles Thorp  | year =1613  | chapterurl =  | pages = 138 p. | url =https://archive.org/details/ananimadversion00clyfgoog|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation  | last =Ainsworth  | first =Henry  | title =A seasonable discourse; or, A censure upon a dialogue of the Anabaptists, intitvled, A description of what God hath predestinated concerning man; is tryed and examined, wherein these seven points are handled & answered, viz. 1.

It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

The '-ism' was added to Hindu in around 1830 to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans in contrast to other religions, and the term was soon appropriated by Indians themselves in the context of building a national identity opposed to colonialism, though the term 'Hindu' was used in Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographic texts in contrast to 'Yavana' or Muslim as early as the sixteenth century\".}}{{Efn|{{harvtxt|von Stietencron|2005|p=229}}: For more than 100 years the word Hindu (plural) continued to denote the Indians in general.

We know that Persian scholars were able to distinguish a number of religions among the Hindus.

The [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] king of [[Devagiri]] named ''[[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramacandra]]'', for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, \"How is this Rama to be described.. who freed [[Varanasi]] from the ''mleccha'' (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara\".<ref name=pollockdevagiri/> Pollock notes that the Yadava king ''Ramacandra'' is described as a devotee of deity [[Shiva]] (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom's location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity [[Vishnu]] avatar.<ref name=pollockdevagiri/> Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.<ref>Sheldon Pollock (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 261-297</ref>\n\nBrajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence.<ref name=brajadulal2004/> According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom ([[Karnataka]]), and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature.<ref name=brajadulal>Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (1998), Representing the other?: Sanskrit sources and the Muslims (eighth to fourteenth century), Manohar Publications, {{ISBN|978-8173042522}}, pages 92-103, Chapter 1 and 2</ref><ref name=brajadulal2004>Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, {{ISBN|978-0761825616}}, pages 303-323</ref> This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards.

However, the existence of non-textual evidence such as cave temples separated by thousands of kilometers, as well as lists of medieval era pilgrimage sites, is evidence of a shared sacred geography and existence of a community that was self-aware of shared religious premises and landscape.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-58}}<ref name=Eck2012p34/> Further, it is a norm in evolving cultures that there is a gap between the \"lived and historical realities\" of a religious tradition and the emergence of related \"textual authorities\".{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=57-58}} The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography.

He was probably born in the town of [[Trujillo,_C\u00e1ceres|Trujillo]], in present-day [[Extremadura]], Spain, in the first years of the 16th century and traveled to the Spanish colonies in the Americas as a young man.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hernando de Alarcon|url=http://factcards.califa.org/exp/alarcon.html|website=Social Studies Fact Cards: California Explorers|publisher=Toucan Valley Publications, Inc.|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==1540 expedition==\nBy 1540, Mexico had been conquered and state-sponsored expeditions were being sent north in search of new wealth and the existence of a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. [[List of Viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy]] of New Spain [[Antonio de Mendoza]] commissioned [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]] to undertake a massive overland expedition with the purpose of finding the [[Seven Cities of Gold|Seven Cities of Cibola]], which were rumored to exist in the unexplored northern interior. The expedition was to be resupplied with stores and provisions delivered by ships traveling up the [[Sea of Cort\u00e9s]], the commander of which would be Alarc\u00f3n.\n\nAlarc\u00f3n set sail from [[Acapulco]] with two ships, the ''San Pedro'' and the ''Santa Catalina'', on May 9, 1540, and was later joined by the ''San Gabriel'' at St. Jago de Buena Esperanza, in [[Colima]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burney|first1=James|title=A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-108-02408-2|edition=Digitally printed}}</ref> His orders from Mendoza were to await the arrival of Coronado's land expedition at a certain latitude along the coast. The meeting with Coronado was never effected, though Alarc\u00f3n reached the appointed place and left letters, which were soon afterwards discovered by [[Melchior Diaz]], another explorer.\n\nAlarc\u00f3n eventually sailed to the northern terminus of the [[Gulf of California]] and completed the explorations begun by [[Francisco de Ulloa]] the preceding year. During this voyage Alarc\u00f3n proved to his satisfaction that no open-water passage existed between the Gulf of California and the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]. Subsequently, on September 26, he entered the mouth of the [[Colorado River]], which he named the ''Buena Guia''. He was the first European to ascend the river for a distance considerable enough to make important observations. On a second voyage, he probably proceeded past the present-day site of [[Yuma, Arizona]]. A map drawn by one of Alarc\u00f3n's pilots is the earliest accurately detailed representation of the Gulf of California and the lower course of the Colorado River.\n\nAlarc\u00f3n is almost unique among 16th-century ''[[conquistadores]]'' in that he reportedly treated the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] he met humanely, as opposed to the often reckless and cruel behavior known from accounts of his contemporaries. Bernard de Voto, in his 1953 ''Westward the Course of Empire'', observed: \"The Indians had an experience they were never to repeat: they were sorry to see these white men leave.\" Alarc\u00f3n wrote of his contact with the [[Yuma language|Yuma-speaking]] [[Yuma Indians|Indians]] along the Colorado. The information he compiled consisted of their practices in warfare, religion, curing and even sexual customs.\n\nCalifornia Historical Landmark No. 568, on the west bank of the Colorado River near [[Andrade, California|Andrade]] in [[Imperial County, California]], commemorates Alarc\u00f3n's expedition having been the first non-Indians to sight land within the present-day state of California.<ref>{{cite web|title=CHL No. 568 Hernando de Alarc\u00f3n Expedition - Imperial|url=https://www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com/landmarks/chl-568|website=California Historical Landmarks|publisher=CaliforniaHistoricalLandmarks.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Detling|first1=Douglas G.|title=California Discovered|url=http://www.detling.us/pdf/California_Discovered.pdf|website=Detling Family News|accessdate=5 May 2017|date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Hammond, George P. & al., ed.

Hakka cuisine was listed in 2014 on the first Hong Kong Inventory of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].<ref>Item 5.27, {{cite web|url=http://www.heritagemuseum.gov.hk/documents/2199315/2199679/first_ICH_inventory_e.pdf|publisher=Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee, Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Hong Kong|title=First Hong Kong Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Hakka people have a marked cuisine and style of Chinese cooking which is little known outside the Hakka home. It concentrates on the texture of food \u2013 the hallmark of Hakka cuisine. Whereas preserved meats feature in Hakka delicacy, stewed, braised, roast meats \u2013 'texturised' contributions to the Hakka palate \u2013 have a central place in their repertoire. Preserved vegetables (\u6885\u83dc) are commonly used for steamed and braised dishes such as steamed minced pork with preserved vegetables and braised pork with salted vegetables.  In fact, the raw materials for Hakka food are no different from raw materials for any other type of regional Chinese cuisine where what is  cooked depends on what is available in the market. Hakka cuisine may be described as outwardly simple but tasty. The skill in Hakka cuisine lies in the ability to cook meat thoroughly without hardening it, and to naturally bring out the proteinous flavour ([[umami]] taste) of meat.\n\nThe Hakka who settled in the harbour and port areas of Hong Kong placed great emphasis on seafood cuisine. Hakka cuisine in Hong Kong is less dominated by expensive meats; instead, emphasis is placed on an abundance of vegetables. Pragmatic and simple, Hakka cuisine is garnished lightly with sparse or little flavouring. Modern Hakka cooking in Hong Kong favours [[offal]], an example being deep-fried intestines ({{zh|t=\u70b8\u5927\u8178|p=zh\u00e1 d\u00e0 ch\u00e1ng|labels=no}}). Others include tofu with preservatives, along with their signature dish, salt baked chicken ({{zh|t=\u9e7d\u7117\u96de|p=y\u00e1n j\u00fa j\u012b|labels=no}}). Another specialty is the [[poon choi]] ({{zh|c=\u76c6\u83dc|p=p\u00e9n c\u00e0i|labels=no}}).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sterling|first1=Richard|last2=Chong|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Qin|first3=Charles Lushan|year=2001|title=World Food Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|publisher=Lonely Planet Publishing|isbn=1-86450-288-6}}</ref> While it may be difficult to prove these were the actual diets of the old Hakka community, it is at present a commonly accepted view. The above dishes and their variations are in fact found and consumed throughout China, including [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], and are not particularly unique or confined to the Hakka population.\n\nBesides meat as source of protein, there is a unique vegan dish called [[lei cha]] ({{zh|c=\u64c2\u8336|p=l\u00e9i ch\u00e1|labels=no}}). It comprises combinations of vegetables and beans. Although not specifically unique for all Hakka people but are definitely famous among the Hakka-Hopo families. This vegetable-based rice tea dish is gaining momentum in some multicultural countries like Malaysia. Cooking of this dish requires the help from other family members to complete all eight combinations. It helps foster the relationship between family members in return.\n\nSteamed bun (\u8336\u679c) is a popular snack for Hakka people. It is mainly made from glutinous rice and is available in sweet or salty options. Sweet version consists of sweetened black-eyed pea pastes or peanuts. Salty version consists of preserved radish.\n\n==Notable dishes==\nHakka food also includes other traditional Taiwanese dishes, just as other Taiwanese ethnic groups do. Some of the more notable dishes in Hakka cuisine are listed as follow:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! English !!Image!! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !! Pinyin !! Hakka !!

This variation of Hakka cuisine is in reality, mostly [[Indian Chinese cuisine]]. It is called \"Hakka cuisine\" because in India, many owners of restaurants who serve this cuisine are of Hakka origin. Typical dishes include 'chilli chicken' and '[[Northeast China|Dongbei (northeastern)]] [[chow mein]]' (an Indianised version of real Northeastern Chinese cuisine), and these restaurants also serve traditional Indian dishes such as [[pakora]]. Being very popular in these areas, this style of cuisine is often mistakenly credited as being representative of Hakka cuisine in general, whereas the authentic style of Hakka cuisine is rarely known in these regions.{{-}}\n\n==Hakka cuisine in Thailand==\nIn Thailand, [[Bangkok's Chinatown]] is [[Yaowarat]] and including neighboring areas such as [[Sampheng]], Charoen Chai, [[Charoen Krung]], Suan Mali, [[Phlapphla Chai]] or [[Wong Wian Yi Sip Song Karakadakhom]] (July 22nd Circle).

It is one of the Eight Great Traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]] and is well known for its hot and spicy flavours,<ref name=Serious>http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/introduction-hunan-chinese-cuisine.html</ref> fresh aroma and deep colours. Common cooking techniques include [[stewing]], [[frying]], pot-[[roasting]], [[braising]] and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]]. Due to the high agricultural output of the region, ingredients for Hunan dishes are many and varied.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the cooking skills employed in Hunan cuisine dates back to the 17th century.<ref name=\"Serious\" /> During the course of its history, Hunan cuisine assimilated a variety of local forms, eventually evolving into its own style. Some well-known dishes include fried chicken with Sichuan spicy sauce ({{zh|s=\u9ebb\u8fa3\u9e21\u4e01|t=\u9ebb\u8fa3\u96de\u4e01|p=m\u00e1l\u00e0 j\u012bd\u012bng|labels=no}}) and smoked pork with dried long green beans ({{zh|s=\u5e72\u8c46\u89d2\u84b8\u814a\u8089|t=\u5e72\u8c46\u89d2\u84b8\u81d8\u8089|p=g\u0101nd\u00f2uji\u01ceo zh\u0113ng l\u00e0r\u00f2u|labels=no}}).\n\nHunan cuisine consists of three primary styles:\n* [[Xiang River]] style: Originating from [[Changsha]], [[Xiangtan]] and [[Hengyang]]\n* [[Dongting Lake]] style: Originating from [[Yueyang]], [[Yiyang]] and [[Changde]]\n* Western Hunan style: Originating from [[Zhangjiajie]], [[Jishou]] and [[Huaihua]]\n\n== Features ==\nKnown for its liberal use of [[chili pepper]]s, [[shallot]]s and [[garlic]], Hunan cuisine is known for being ''gan la'' ({{zh|c=\u5e72\u8fa3|p=g\u0101n l\u00e0|l=dry and spicy|labels=no}}) or purely hot, as opposed to [[Sichuan cuisine]], to which it is often compared.<ref name=\"Serious\" /> Sichuan cuisine is known for its distinctive ''[[Sichuan mala|ma la]]'' ({{zh|c=\u9ebb\u8fa3|p=m\u00e1 l\u00e0|l=spicy and numbing|labels=no}}) seasoning and other complex flavour combinations, frequently employs [[Sichuan pepper]]<ref name=\"Serious\" /> along with chilies which are often dried. It also utilises more dried or preserved ingredients and condiments. Hunan cuisine, on the other hand, is often spicier by pure chili content and contains a larger variety of fresh ingredients. Both Hunan and Sichuan cuisine are perhaps significantly oilier than the other cuisines in China, but Sichuan dishes are generally oilier than Hunan dishes. Another characteristic distinguishing Hunan cuisine from Sichuan cuisine is that, in general, Hunan cuisine uses smoked and cured goods in its dishes much more frequently.\n \nAnother feature of Hunan cuisine is that the menu changes with the seasons. In a hot and humid summer, a meal will usually start with cold dishes or a platter holding a selection of cold meats with chilies for opening the pores and keeping cool in the summer. In winter, a popular choice is the [[hot pot]], thought to heat the blood in the cold months. A special hot pot called ''yuanyang huoguo'' ({{zh|s=\u9e33\u9e2f\u706b\u9505|t=\u9d1b\u9d26\u706b\u934b|p=yu\u0101ny\u0101ng h\u01d4og\u016bo|l=[[Mandarin duck#Chinese culture|Mandarin ducks]] hot pot|labels=no}}) is notable for splitting the pot into two sides \u2013 a spicy one and a mild one. One of the classic dishes in Hunan cuisine served in restaurants and at home is farmer pepper fried pork. It is made with several common ingredients: pork belly, green pepper, [[douchi|fermented black beans]] and other spices.\n\nChilies are an entire class of flavourings in Hunan cuisine.<ref name=\"Serious\" />\n\n== List of notable dishes ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As such, hyperinflation is often associated with some stress to the government budget, such as wars or their aftermath, sociopolitical upheavals, a collapse in export prices, or other crises that make it difficult for the government to collect tax revenue.

In his book, Cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%, and as ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50% and stays that way for at least a year.<ref name=\"Hyper\">[[Phillip D. Cagan|Phillip Cagan]], ''The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation'', in Milton Friedman (Editor), ''Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1956).</ref> Economists usually follow [[Phillip D. Cagan|Cagan]]\u2019s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%.<ref name=\"On Cagan\"/>\n\nThe [[International Accounting Standards Board]] has issued guidance on accounting rules in a hyperinflationary environment. It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises. Instead, it lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/standard28 |title=IAS 29 \u2014 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies |accessdate=10 April 2012 |author=International Accounting Standards |publisher=IASB}}</ref>\n*The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power\n*The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;\n*Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;\n*Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and\n*The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile there can be a number of causes of high inflation, most hyperinflations have been caused by government [[budget deficit]]s financed by money creation. [[Peter Bernholz]] analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way.<ref>Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.2 and Table 5.1</ref> A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of [[paper money]], instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789-1796, occurred after the use of [[fiat currency]] became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency, the [[assignat]]s.\n\n===Money supply===\nHyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.\n\nThe price increases that result from the rapid [[money creation]] creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both [[monetary inflation]] and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the [[velocity of money]] flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parsson |first=Jens |authorlink=Jens O. Parsson |title=Dying of Money (Chapter 17: Velocity) |publisher=Wellspring Press |year=1974 |location=Boston, MA |pages=112\u2013119}}</ref> The real stock of money, M/P, decreases. Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level.\n\nThis results in an imbalance between the [[supply and demand]] for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a [[bank run]]. Usually, the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money.<ref name=\"z\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408131232/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2003/October/October2/1365.shtml Hyperinflation: causes, cures] Bernard Mufute, 2003-10-02, \"Hyperinflation has its root cause in money growth, which is not supported by growth in the output of goods and services. Usually the excessive money supply growth is caused by financing of the government budget deficit through the printing of money.\"</ref>\n\nGovernments have sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy, as it allows a government to devalue its debts and reduce (or avoid) a tax increase. Inflation is effectively a [[regressive tax]] on the users of money,<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910064531/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008}}</ref> but less overt than levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens. Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. [[Monetary inflation]] can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from [[tax]]es, [[government debt]], cost cutting, or by other means, because either\n*during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or\n*government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or\n*a combination of the above.\n\nTheories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between [[seigniorage]] and the [[inflation tax]]. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when [[fiat money]] is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.\n\n[[File:German Hyperinflation.jpg|right|thumb|The price of gold in Germany, 1 January 1918 \u2013 30 November 1923. (The vertical scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]).]]\n\nFrom this, it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either [[depression (economics)|depression]] or military defeat. The root cause is a matter of more dispute. In both [[classical economics]] and [[monetarism]], it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained [[seigniorage]] of the monetary authority, and the gains from the [[inflation tax]].\n\nIn neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the [[monetary base]], that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, \"monetize\" the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the [[Chinese Nationalists]] from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.\n\nHyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. In both of these models, however, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank [[seigniorage]], the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by \"running the printing presses.\"\n\nNevertheless, the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23) still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the [[complexity economics]] in conjunction with research areas like [[mass hysteria]], [[bandwagon effect]], social brain, and [[mirror neuron]]s.<ref>Wolfgang Chr.

Economists see both a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and an increase in the [[velocity of money]] if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the \"crisis of confidence\" model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the \"monetary model\" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first\u2014either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.\n\nIn the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent\u2014whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic [[Vienna]], and capital flight, sometimes because of \"contagion\" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.\n\nIn the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot \"win\" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.\n\nWhatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and [[velocity of money]]. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.\n\nBecause rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a [[store of value]], people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]], hyperinflation is out of control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange.\n\nDuring a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie. There may also be extensive [[capital flight]] or flight to a \"hard\" currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with [[capital control]]s, an idea that has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy that is operating in an \"abnormal\" way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in \"too much money chasing too few goods\" formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation.\n\nOnce the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required. Simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919\u2013November 1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning.\n\nAlthough [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further.\n\n[[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]] said \"We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas.\"<ref>\"Controls blamed for U.S. energy woes\", ''Los Angeles Times'', 13 February 1977, Milton Friedman press conference in Los Angeles.</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00104, Inflation, Tapezieren mit Geldscheinen.jpg|right|thumb|[[inflation in the Weimar Republic|Germany, 1923]]: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper.]]\n\nHyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings; distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets; causes the monetary base, whether [[money|specie]] or hard currency, to flee the country; and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money\u2014gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards ([[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]' [[Thiers' law|Law]]). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\">Bernholz, Peter 2003</ref> The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in [[Zimbabwe]] in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.\n\nEnactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of [[paper money]] relative to gold, silver, [[hard currency]], or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ Jefferson County Miracles], ''Wall Street Journal'', 6 March 2008.</ref> Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to \"hard money\". Older economies would revert to [[hard currency]] and [[barter (economics)|barter]] when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a \"run\" on the [[store of value]].\n\nMuch attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%\u2014and then only briefly\u2014and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with \"hyperinflated cash\", nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. Contractual \"early redemption penalties\" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of ''n'' months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out\u2014certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.\n\n[[Ludwig von Mises]] used the term \"crack-up boom\" (German: Katastrophenhausse) to describe the economic consequences of an unmitigated increasing in the base-money supply.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Ludwig von Mises]] |title=[[Human Action]] |publisher=Fox & Wilkes, San Francisco, 4th edition, 1986 |page=428 |isbn=0-930073-18-5}}</ref> As more and more money is provided, interest rates decline towards zero. Realizing that fiat money is losing value, investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate, stocks, even art; as these appear to represent \"real\" value. Asset prices are thus becoming inflated. This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system. The Cantillon effect<ref>[https://azizonomics.com/2012/08/07/the-cantillon-effect/ Definition of Cantillon effect, first described by [[Richard Cantillon]]]</ref> says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy.\n\n===Aftermath===\nHyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies, such as imposing the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is [[dollarization]], the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre]] in early 2000. But usually the \"dollarization\" takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\"/>\n\nHyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it, and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German [[Bundesbank]], or moving to some hard basis of currency, such as a [[currency board]]. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff [[wage and price controls]] in the wake of hyperinflation, but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the [[central bank]], and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.\n\n===Currency===\nIn countries experiencing hyperinflation, the [[central bank]] often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of unusually large demoninations of [[banknote]]s, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.\n*By late 1923, the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks (10<sup>14</sup>; 100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million).<ref>1 billion in the German long scale = 1000 milliard = 1 trillion US scale.</ref><ref>[http://www.sammler.com/coins/inflation.htm Values of the most important German Banknotes of the Inflation Period from 1920 \u2013 1923]</ref> At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks. One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28 \u00d7 10<sup>19</sup>, or 33 [[quintillion]]) marks.<ref>''The Penniless Billionaires'', Max Shapiro, New York Times Book Co., 1980, page 203, {{ISBN|0-8129-0923-2}} Shipiro comments: \"Of course, one must not forget the 5 pfennig!\"</ref>\n*The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the [[Hungarian National Bank]] for the amount of 100 quintillion [[peng\u0151]] (100,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10<sup>20</sup>; 100 million million million) [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p136.htm image]. (A banknote worth 10 times as much, 10<sup>21</sup> (1 [[sextillion]]) peng\u0151, was printed but not issued [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p137.htm image].) The banknotes did not show the numbers in full: \"hundred million b.-peng\u0151\" (\"hundred million trillion peng\u0151\") and \"one milliard b.-peng\u0151\" were spelled out instead. This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 [[Zimbabwean dollar]] banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown.\n*The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever \u2013 41,900,000,000,000,000% (4.19 \u00d7 10<sup>16</sup>% or 41.9 quadrillion percent) for July 1946, amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours. By comparison, recent figures (as of 14 November 2008) estimate Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at 89.7 [[sextillion]] (10<sup>21</sup>) percent.<ref name=\"cato\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/zimbabwe |title=New Hyperinflation Index (HHIZ) Puts Zimbabwe Inflation at 89.7 sextillion percent, |author=Hanke, Steve H. |publisher=[[The Cato Institute]] |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2008}}</ref> The highest monthly inflation rate of that period was 79.6 billion percent, and a doubling time of 24.7 hours. In figures, that is 79,600,000,000%.\n\nOne way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency. (As an example, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read \"10 new dollars\".) A recent example of this is Turkey's revaluation of the [[Lira]] on 1 January 2005, when the old [[Turkish lira]] (TRL) was converted to the [[New Turkish lira]] (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called [[redenomination]] or [[revaluation]] and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.\n\nSome banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination, as it would have taken too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).\n\nMetallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded its face value. Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.\n\nGovernments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. None of these actions addresses the root causes of inflation; and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation. [[Price controls]] will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods, causing disruptions of [[supply chain]]s. Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it economic to continue producing and/or distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the shortages.\n\nThere are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many [[automated teller machines]] and payment card machines struggled with [[arithmetic overflow]] errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/zimbabwe |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=Zimbabwe knocks 10 zeros off currency amid world's highest inflation |date=31 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Notable hyperinflationary episodes==\n\n===Rome===\nDuring the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], Rome underwent hyperinflation caused by years of coinage [[devaluation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-currency-debasement-contributed-to-fall-of-rome-2016-2|title=This infographic shows how currency debasement contributed to the fall of Rome|work=Business Insider|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\n[[File:The Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table.pdf|right|thumb|Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table that lists 56 episodes of hyperinflation (following Cagan's definition)]]\nIn 1922, inflation in Austria reached 1,426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11,836, with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 [[Austrian krone]]s.<ref>[http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219200751/http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf|date=19 February 2012}}</ref> After [[World War I]], essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss, and the number of state employees in the capital, Vienna, was greater than in the earlier monarchy, even though the new republic was nearly one-eighth of the size.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson|title=When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxUBAwAAQBAJ|date=12 October 2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}</ref>\n\nObserving the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation, which included the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies, Owen S.

Paper currency was introduced during the [[Tang Dynasty]], and was generally welcomed. It maintained its value, as successive Chinese governments put in place strict controls on issuance. The convenience of paper currency for trade purposes led to strong demand for paper currency. It was only when discipline on quantity supplied broke down that hyperinflation emerged.<ref>The Truth About Inflation, Chapter 2, [[Paul Donovan (economist)|Paul Donovan]], Routledge 2015</ref> The [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368) was the first to print large amounts of fiat paper money to fund their wars, resulting in hyperinflation. Much later, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] went through hyperinflation from 1948\u201349. In 1947, the highest denomination bill was 50,000 [[Chinese yuan#First yuan, 1889\u20131948|yuan]]. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan. The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan. In less than a year, the highest denomination was 10,000,000 gold yuan. In the final days of the civil war, the Silver Yuan was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 Gold Yuan. Meanwhile, the highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan (issued by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949). After the [[renminbi]] was instituted by the new communist government, hyperinflation ceased, with a revaluation of 1:10,000 old [[First series of the renminbi|Renminbi]] in 1955.\n\n*(1) Start and End Date: Jul. 1943 \u2013 Aug. 1945\n*(1) Peak Month and Rate of Inflation: Jun. 1945, 302%\n*(2) Start and End Date: Oct. 1947 \u2013 Mid.

This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods. During the German and Italian [[Axis occupation of Greece]] (1941-1944), the agricultural, mineral, industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces, but also to secure provisions for the [[Afrika Korps]]. One part of these \"sales\" of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German [[DEGRIGES]] and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices. As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell, the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate.\nWhile shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding, the prices of commodities soared. The other part of the \"purchases\" was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses. As prices soared, the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases; each time prices increased, the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards. For the year November 1943 - November 1944, the inflation rate was 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup>%, the circulation was 6.28 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas.\nThe hyperinflation started subsiding immediately after the departure of the German occupation forces, but inflation rates took several years before they fell below 50%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Athanassios K.

Both of these events resulted in introduction of new currencies. In 1924, the ''z\u0142oty'' replaced the original currency of post-war Poland, the mark. The currency was then replaced by a new one of the same name in 1950, which was assigned the ISO code of PLZ. As a result of the second hyperinflation crisis, the current ''new z\u0142oty'' was introduced in 1990 (ISO code: PLN). See the article on [[Polish z\u0142oty]] for more information about the currency's history.\n\nThe newly independent Poland had been struggling with a large budget deficit since its inception in 1918 but it was in 1923 when inflation reached its peak. The exchange rate to the American dollar went up from 9 Polish marks for a dollar in 1918 to 6,375,000 marks per dollar at the end of 1923. A new personal 'inflation tax' was introduced. The resolution of the crisis is attributed to the person of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]], who became the [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister of Poland]] in December 1923. Having nominated an all-new government and been granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the [[Sejm]] for a period of six months, he went on to introduce a new currency, establish a new national bank and scrap the inflation tax, which took place throughout 1924.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|title=Hiperinflacja - Polish National Bank|date=7 May 2015|website=www.nbportal.pl|language=PL|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe economic crisis in Poland in 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit. Although the inflation was not as acute as in 1920s, it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600% in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990. The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in 1989, named so after the main author of the reforms, the minister of finance [[Leszek Balcerowicz]]. The plan was largely inspired by the previous Grabski's reforms.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Philippines===\nThe Japanese government occupying the Philippines during [[World War II]] issued fiat currencies for general circulation. The Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]] government led by [[Jose P.

The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent, which is equivalent to a 98% daily rate, or around {{gaps|7|base=\u200910|e=108}} percent yearly rate.

As a result, the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and several years of acute inflation and [[Mexican peso|peso]] devaluation, leading to an accumulated inflation rate of almost 27,000% between December 1975 and late 1988. On 1 January 1993, Mexico created a new currency, the ''nuevo peso'' (\"new peso\", or MXN), which chopped three zeros off the old peso (One new peso was equal to 1,000 old MXP pesos).\n\n===Roman Egypt===\nIn Roman Egypt, where the best documentation on pricing has survived, the price of a measure of wheat was 200 drachmae in 276 AD, and increased to more than 2,000,000 drachmae in 334 AD, roughly 1,000,000% inflation in a span of 58 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Life Contributors |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-gasoline-thanks-ben-2012-4 |title=Traveling In Europe Has Become Absurdly Expensive\u2014And You Know The Reason Why |publisher=Business Insider |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the price increased by a factor of 10,000 over 58 years, the annual rate of inflation was only 17.2% (1.4% monthly) compounded.\n\n===Romania===\nRomania experienced high inflation in the 1990s.

Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about 9.96 years after the currency was introduced.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chronic inflation]]\n*[[Gold as an investment]]\n*[[Hyperstagflation]]\n*[[Inflation accounting]]\n*[[Inflationism]]\n*[[Outline of economics]]\n*[[Zero stroke]]\n*[[Hoarding]]\n*[[Blockade]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author=Peter Bernholz|title=Monetary Regimes and Inflation: History, Economic and Political Relationships, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8TiBwAAQBAJ|date=30 April 2015|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78471-763-6}}\n*Cagan, Phillip, \"The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation.\" In Milton Friedman, ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=p0L6MAAACAAJ Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money].

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] in the 1920s he introduced themes of efficiency in the business community and provided government support for standardization, efficiency and international trade. As president from 1929 to 1933, his domestic programs were overshadowed by the onset of the Great Depression. Hoover was defeated in a landslide [[United States presidential election, 1932|election in 1932]] by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. After this loss, Hoover became staunchly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], and advocated against Roosevelt's New Deal policies.\n\nA lifelong [[Quaker]], he became a successful [[mining engineer]] with a global perspective. He built an international reputation as a humanitarian by leading international relief efforts in [[Belgium]] during [[World War I]], 1914-1917. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917 he became \"food czar\" as head of the [[U.S. Food Administration]] with charge of much of the nation's food supply and a massive advertising campaign to help consumers adjust and save. He worked well with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the cabinet, and gained a large national audience. After the war, he led the [[American Relief Administration]], which provided food to the inhabitants of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Hoover was popular among [[Progressive Era|progressives]] as a potential candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], but his candidacy quickly petered out. Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] won and appointed Hoover as Secretary of Commerce. Hoover was an unusually active and visible cabinet member, becoming known as \"Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments\". Hoover won the Republican nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]], and defeated Democrat [[Al Smith]] in a landslide. Hoover avoided the anti-Catholicism that hurt Smith, but in a time of peace and prosperity his success was highly likely.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] was the central issue of his presidency, starting with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash of October 1929]]. There were occasional upswings but more frequent downswings until the economy verged on disaster in 1931-33, along with that of most of the industrial world. Hoover pursued a variety of policies in an attempt to lift the economy, but opposed direct federal relief efforts until late in his tenure. He asked business and labor leaders to avoid wage cuts and work stoppages, and raised taxes in the hope of balancing the budget. In 1930, he reluctantly approved the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff]], which sent foreign trade spiraling down. The economy kept falling, and the unemployment rate rose to 25%, with heavy industry, mining, and wheat and cotton farming hit especially hard. In 1932, Hoover signed a major public works bill and established the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which was designed to provide government loans to banks, railroads and big businesses in danger of failing. The downward economic spiral, along with violent dispersal of the [[Bonus Army]], set the stage for Hoover's overwhelming defeat by Roosevelt, who promised a [[New Deal]].\n\nHoover became a conservative spokesman in opposition to the domestic and foreign policies of Roosevelt. He opposed entry into the [[Second World War]] and was not called on to serve in any public role during the war. He had better relations with President [[Harry S. Truman]], and Hoover helped produce [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|a number of reports]] that changed U.S. occupation policy in Germany. Truman also appointed Hoover to head the [[Hoover Commission]], intended to foster greater efficiency throughout the federal bureaucracy, and Hoover served on a similar commission under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. By the time of his death in 1964, he had rehabilitated his image. Nevertheless, Hoover is generally not ranked highly in [[historical rankings of presidents of the United States]].\n\n==Family background and early life==\n[[File:Herbert Hoover in 1877.jpg|thumb|upright=.57|left|Herbert Hoover in 1877]]\nHerbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874 in [[West Branch, Iowa|West Branch]], [[Iowa]]. He is the only president born in that state, and the first born west of the [[Mississippi River]]. His father, Jesse Hoover (1849\u20131880), was a [[blacksmith]] and farm implement store owner of German (Pfautz, Wehmeyer), German-Swiss (Huber, Burkhart) and English ancestry.

He was convinced from his Belgian work that centralization of authority was essential to any relief effort; he demanded, and got, great power, albeit not as much as he sought.{{sfn|Burner|1996|pp=96\u201397}} Hoover believed \"food will win the war\"; and beginning on September 29, this slogan was introduced and put into frequent use.{{sfn|Burner|1996|p=102}} Earning the appellation of \"food czar\", Hoover recruited a volunteer force of hundreds of thousands of women and deployed [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda]] in movie theaters, schools, and churches.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=41\u201343}}\n\nHe carefully selected men to assist in the agency leadership&nbsp;\u2013 Alonzo Taylor (technical abilities), [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] (political associations), [[Gifford Pinchot]] (agricultural influence) and Julius Barnes (business acumen).{{sfn|Burner|1996|p=101}} Determined to avoid rationing, Hoover established set days for people to avoid eating specified foods and save them for soldiers' rations: meatless Mondays, wheatless Wednesdays, and \"when in doubt, eat potatoes\". These policies were dubbed \"Hooverizing\" by government publicists, in spite of Hoover's continual orders that publicity should not mention him by name. The agency employed a system of price controls and licensing requirements for suppliers to maximize production. Despite efforts to prevent it, some companies reaped great profits.{{sfn|Burner|1996|pp=104\u2013109}}\n\n===Post-war relief and 1920 election===\nDays after the end of World War I in November 1918, Hoover sailed to Europe. The United States Food Administration became the [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA), and Hoover was charged with providing food to Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions, including the inhabitants of Germany and the former [[Habsburg Empire]]. U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, and Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children. In addition to nourishing millions, the ARA also helped the United States avoid a potentially problematic domestic food surplus. Hoover provided aid to the defeated German nation after the war, as well as relief to [[famine]]-stricken [[Bolshevik]]-controlled areas of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] in 1921, despite the opposition of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and other Republicans.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=41\u201343, 57\u201358}} The [[Russian famine of 1921|Russian famine]] of 1921\u201322 claimed six million people, but the intervention of the ARA likely saved millions of lives.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.hoover.org/research/food-weapon| publisher = Hoover Institution | title = Hoover Digest | contribution = Food as a Weapon.}}</ref> When asked if he was not thus helping Bolshevism, Hoover stated,\n\n{{quote|Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=41\u201343, 57\u201358}}}}\n\nReflecting the gratitude of many Europeans, in July 1922, Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] wrote to Hoover:\n\n{{quote|Your help will enter history as a unique, gigantic achievement, worthy of the greatest glory, which will long remain in the memory of millions of Russians whom you have saved from death.<ref>\"[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2011/pr-famine-040411.html How the U.S. saved a starving Soviet Russia: PBS film highlights Stanford scholar's research on the 1921\u201323 famine]\". Stanford University. April 4, 2011</ref>}}\n\nAs one of the most powerful individuals in Europe, Hoover became involved in continental politics. He was broadly supportive of Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]], and was appointed by Wilson to the U.S. delegation at the peace conference in Versailles. He urged ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], but opposed harsh reparations for Germany.<ref name=wsj10282017>'A Wonder Boy on the Wrong Side of History', Edward Kosner, Wall Street Journal, October 28, 2017</ref> He opposed a [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|monarchist coup]] in [[Hungary]] and demanded the appointment of the moderate [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] in [[Poland]]. He condemned [[Bolshevism]], but warned President Wilson against an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention]] in [[Russia]], viewing the [[White movement|White Russian]] forces as little better and fearing the possibility of a protracted U.S. involvement.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=43\u201345}}\n\nHoover had been little known among the American public before 1914, but emerged as perhaps the second-most famous person in the United States after President Wilson. In the lead-up to the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], Hoover was often mentioned as a potential candidate, but his partisan affiliation was unclear. Hoover particularly appealed to progressives of both parties, who commended his wartime push for higher taxes, criticism of Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], and advocacy for measures such as the minimum wage, forty-eight-hour workweek, and elimination of [[child labor]]. Yet Hoover's [[Horatio Alger myth|\"rags to riches\"]] story and war-time leadership made him appealing to many others as well.\n\nIn March 1920, Hoover publicly declared his allegiance with the GOP, stating that he would not run for but would not refuse the 1920 Republican nomination. Hoover had various reasons for choosing the Republican Party, including a split with Wilson over the Versailles Treaty (Hoover had come to accept the [[Lodge Reservations]] to the treaty), and his view that the Democrats would likely lose the 1920 election. However, the conservative Old Guard of the GOP viewed Hoover warily, and his time as Food Czar had also made him numerous enemies among farmers, an important bloc in the GOP. Hoover's candidacy for the GOP nomination fizzled out after his defeat in the California primary by [[favorite son]] [[Hiram Johnson]]. In the general election, Hoover supported the Republican nominee, [[Warren G. Harding]], who emerged victorious.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=45\u201350}}\n\nIn 1919, Hoover established the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archive|Hoover War Collection]] at Stanford University. He donated all the files of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, the U.S. Food Administration, and the American Relief Administration, and pledged $50,000 as an endowment ({{Inflation|US|50000|1919|fmt=eq}}). Scholars were sent to Europe to collect pamphlets, society publications, government documents, newspapers, posters, proclamations, and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions that followed it. The collection was renamed the Hoover War Library in 1922 and is now known as the [[Hoover Institution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hoover Institution Timeline |url=http://www.hoover.org/about/timeline |publisher=Hoover Institution |accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Secretary of Commerce==\n[[File:HooverCommerce1926.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Assistants William McCracken (left) & Walter Drake (right) with Secretary Hoover (center)]]\nAfter his election as president in 1920, Harding rewarded Hoover for his support, offering to appoint him as either [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] or Secretary of Commerce. Expecting opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate, Hoover initially decided to refuse a Cabinet position, but Harding paired Hoover's nomination with that of [[Andrew Mellon]], who many Republicans hoped would become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. Secretary of Commerce was considered a minor Cabinet post, with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities, but Hoover decided to accept the position. Hoover remained in office until 1928, serving in both the Harding and Coolidge administrations.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nHoover envisioned the Commerce Department as the hub of the nation's growth and stability. From Harding he demanded, and received, authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government. He created many sub-departments and committees, overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics, the census and radio, to air travel. In some instances he \"seized\" control of responsibilities from other Cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well. He became known as the \"Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments\".{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=53\u201363}}\n\n[[File:Hoover and Harding at baseball game.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover (left) with President Harding at a baseball game, 1921]]\n\nMany of Hoover's efforts as Commerce Secretary centered on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency in business and industry. This included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations, reducing industrial losses from accident and injury, and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping. One major achievement was to promote product standardizations. He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen. Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas.{{sfn|Hart|1998}}\n\nAs secretary and later as president, Hoover revolutionized relations between business and government. Rejecting the adversarial stance of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, he sought to make the Commerce Department a powerful service organization, empowered to forge cooperative voluntary partnerships between government and business. This philosophy is often called \"[[associationalism]]\". Both the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] opposed Hoover's goals,<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&pg=330}}</ref> but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Maple Flooring Manufacturers' Assn. v.

He worked with bankers and the [[savings and loan]] industry to promote the new long-term home mortgage, which dramatically stimulated home construction.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hutchison | first = Janet | title = Building for Babbitt: the State and the Suburban Home Ideal | journal = Journal of Policy History | year = 1997 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=184\u2013210 |doi=10.1017/S0898030600005923 }}</ref>\n\n===Radio and air travel===\n[[File:HerbertClarkHoover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert Hoover listening to a [[radio receiver]]]]\nHoover's radio conferences played a key role in the early organization, development and regulation of radio broadcasting. Prior to the [[Radio Act of 1927]], the Secretary of Commerce was unable to deny radio licensing or reassign broadcast frequencies. With help from supporters Senator Dill and Representative White, Hoover brought the issue of radio control to the Senate floor. Hoover fought for more power to control the proliferation of licensed radio stations (which in 1927, stood at 732 stations). With help from Dill and White, Hoover promoted the Dill-White Bill which eventually would become the Radio Act of 1927. This act allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed \"non-useful\" to the public. Hoover's attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all Congressmen, and he received much opposition from the Senate and from radio station owners. However, Hoover's contributions to regulate radio in its infancy heavily influenced the modern radio system.<ref>{{Citation|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=A Tower In Babel; A history of Broadcasting in the United States to 1933|year=1966|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHoover was also influential in the early development of air travel. He sought to create a thriving private industry boosted by indirect government subsidies. He encouraged the development of emergency landing fields and required all runways to be equipped with lights and radio beams. He also encouraged farmers to make use of planes for [[Aerial application|crop dusting]]. In light of his efforts, Washington, D.C. named its first airport [[Hoover Field]].{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Traffic conferences===\nAs Commerce Secretary, Hoover also hosted two national conferences on street traffic, in 1924 and 1926 (a third convened in 1930, during Hoover's presidency). Collectively the meetings were called the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover's chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets.<ref>Peter D. Norton, ''Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City'' (MIT Press, 2008), pp. 178\u2013197 {{ISBN|0-262-14100-0}}</ref>\n\n===Mississippi flood===\nThe [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke the banks and [[levee]]s of the lower Mississippi River in early 1927, resulting in flooding of millions of acres and leaving 1.5 million people displaced from their homes. Although such a disaster did not fall under the duties of the Commerce Department, the governors of six states along the Mississippi specifically asked for Herbert Hoover in the emergency. President Coolidge appointed Hoover to coordinate the response to the flood.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=68\u201369}} Hoover personally crisscrossed the Mississippi Valley, giving speeches and coordinating the response. He established over one hundred tent cities and a fleet of more than six hundred vessels, and raised $17 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|17|1927|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}). In large part due to his leadership during the flood crisis, by 1928, Hoover had begun to overshadow President Coolidge himself.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=68\u201371}}\n\nThe treatment of African-Americans during the disaster endangered Hoover's reputation as a humanitarian. Local officials brutalized black farmers and prevented them from leaving relief camps, aid intended for African-American [[sharecroppers]] was often given instead to the landowners, and black men often were conscripted by locals into forced labor, sometimes at gun point.<ref>Kosar, Kevin R.

Washington D.C.</ref> Knowing the potential damage to his presidential hopes if this became public, Hoover struck a deal with [[Robert Russa Moton]], the prominent [[African-American]] successor to [[Booker T. Washington]] as president of the [[Tuskegee Institute]]. In exchange for keeping the sufferings of African-Americans quiet, Hoover promised unprecedented influence for African-Americans should he become president. Moton agreed, and following the accommodationist philosophy of Washington, he worked actively to conceal the information from the media.<ref name=\"pbs\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/flood-moton-cac/ \u2018Robert Moton and the Colored Advisory Commission\u2019], PBS.org</ref>\n\n==Presidential election of 1928==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1928}}\n\n===Republican nomination===\nWhen President Calvin Coolidge announced in August 1927 that he would not seek a second full term of office in the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]], Hoover became the leading Republican candidate, despite the fact Coolidge was lukewarm on Hoover, often deriding his ambitious and popular Commerce Secretary as \"Wonder Boy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duncanentertainment.com/interview_walch.php|title=The Duncan Group \u2013 Interviews |publisher=Duncanentertainment.com |date=December 2007|accessdate=June 17, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006201816/http://www.duncanentertainment.com/interview_walch.php |archivedate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> Coolidge had been reluctant to choose Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that\n\n{{quote|for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice\u2014all of it bad.

Smith. Smith likewise was a proponent of efficiency earned as governor of New York. Both candidates were pro-business, and each promised to improve conditions for farmers, reform immigration laws, and maintain America's isolationist foreign policy.\n\nWhere they differed was on the [[Volstead Act]] which outlawed the sale of liquor and beer. Smith was a \"wet\" who called for its repeal, whereas Hoover gave limited support for [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], calling it an \"experiment noble in purpose\". His use of ''\"experiment\"'' suggested it was not permanent. While Smith won extra support among Catholics in the big cities, he was also the target of intense [[anti-Catholicism]] from some Protestant communities, especially amongst Southern Baptists and German Lutherans.<ref>Edmund A.

Nonetheless, the total Federal deficit in 1932 was 4.5% of GDP. Along with falling tax revenue, this was caused by the increase in total spending from about $2.9 billion in 1929 to about $4.6 billion in 1932, a total increase of about 58 percent.<ref>Rate Limited, federal-budget.insidegov.com</ref><ref>Outlays of the Federal Government, by Major Function: 1900 to 1939.

The act increased taxes across the board, so that top earners were taxed at 63% on their net income&nbsp;\u2013 up from 25% when Herbert Hoover took office. The 1932 Act also increased the tax on the net income of corporations from 12% to 13.75%.<ref>James Ciment. ''Encyclopedia of the Great Depression and the New Deal''. Sharpe Reference, 2001. p. 396</ref> Additionally, under Hoover, the [[estate tax]] was doubled and [[corporate tax]]es were raised by almost 15%. Also, a \"check tax\" took effect, placing a 2-cent tax (over 30 cents in today's economy) on all bank checks. Economists William D. Lastrapes and George Selgin conclude that the check tax was \"an important contributing factor to that period's severe monetary contraction\".<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.terry.uga.edu/~selgin/files/check_tax.pdf |title=The Check Tax: Fiscal Folly and The Great Monetary Contraction |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=December 1997 |pages=859\u201378 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700019562 |last1=Lastrapes |first1=William D. |last2=Selgin |first2=Grorge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311034839/http://www.terry.uga.edu/~selgin/files/check_tax.pdf |archivedate=March 11, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Despite the passage of the Revenue Act, the federal government continued to run a budget deficit.{{sfn|Fausold 1985|p=161}}\n[[File:President & Mrs Hoover in Belvidere IL cph.3b12319.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Herbert and Lou Henry Hoover aboard a train in Illinois.]]\n\n===Foreign relations===\nAccording to Leuchtenburg, Hoover was \"the last American president to take office with no conspicuous need to pay attention to the rest of the world\". Nevertheless, during Hoover's term, the world order established with the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] began to crumble.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|p=117}}\n\nAs president, Hoover largely made good on his pledge made prior to assuming office not to interfere in Latin America's internal affairs. In 1930, he released the [[Clark Memorandum]], a rejection of the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] and a move towards [[non-interventionism]] in Latin America. Hoover did not completely refrain from the use of the military in Latin American affairs; he thrice threatened intervention in the [[Dominican Republic]], and he sent warships to [[El Salvador]] to support the government against a left-wing revolution.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=120\u2013121}} But he wound down the [[Banana Wars]], ending the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|occupation of Nicaragua]] and nearly bringing an end to the [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupation of Haiti]]. Franklin Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor policy]] would continue the trend towards non-interventionism in Latin America. {{sfn|Fausold 1985|pp=183\u2013186}}\n\nThough the United States remained outside of the [[League of Nations]], Hoover showed a willingness to work within multilateral structures. Hoover pursued United States membership in the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], but the Senate never voted on his proposal. The Senate also defeated Hoover's proposed [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] Treaty with Canada.{{sfn|O'Brien|Rosen|1981|p=92}}\n\nIn 1930, the United States and other major naval powers signed the [[London Naval Treaty]], an extension of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which sought to prevent a naval [[arms race]].{{sfn|Fausold 1985|pp=175\u2013176}} The treaty represented the first time that the naval powers had agreed to cap their tonnage of auxiliary vessels (previous agreements had focused on [[capital ship]]s), but the treaty failed to include France or Italy. The treaty provoked a nationalist backlash in Japan due to its reconfirmation of the \"5-5-3\" ratio which limited Japan to a smaller fleet than the United States or the United Kingdom. At the 1932 [[World Disarmament Conference]], Hoover urged worldwide cutbacks in armaments and the outlawing of [[tank]]s and [[bomber]]s, but his proposals were not adopted.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=117\u2013119}}\n\nIn 1931, Japan [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] [[Manchuria]], defeating the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]'s military forces and establishing [[Manchukuo]], a puppet state. The Hoover administration deplored the invasion, but also sought to avoid antagonizing the Japanese, fearing that taking too strong a stand would weaken the moderate forces in the Japanese government. In response to the Japanese invasion, Hoover and Secretary of State [[Henry Stimson]] outlined the [[Stimson Doctrine]], which held that the United States would not recognize territories gained by force. The Hoover administration based this declaration on the 1928 [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], in which several nations (including Japan and the United States) renounced war and promised to peacefully solve disputes. In the aftermath of invasion of Manchuria, Stimson and other members of the Cabinet came to believe that war with Japan might be inevitable, though Hoover continued to push for [[disarmament]] among the world powers.<ref>Richard N.

Hoover also made U.S. bankers agree to refrain from demanding payment on private loans from Germans.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=126\u2013127}} Hoover hoped that the moratorium would help stabilize the European economy, which he viewed as a major cause of economic troubles in the United States.{{sfn|Fausold 1985|pp=143\u2013144}} As the moratorium neared its expiration the following year, an attempt to find a permanent solution was made at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932]].

Although offered money by Congress to return home, some members of the \"Bonus Army\" remained. Washington police attempted to remove the demonstrators from their camp, but they were outnumbered and unsuccessful. Shots were fired by the police in a futile attempt to attain order, and two protesters were killed while many officers were injured.\n\nHoover sent U.S. Army forces led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and helped by lower ranking officers [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[George S. Patton]] to stop a march. MacArthur, believing he was fighting a communist revolution, chose to clear out the camp with military force. In the ensuing clash, hundreds of civilians were injured. Hoover had sent orders that the Army was not to move on the encampment, but MacArthur chose to ignore the command. Hoover was incensed, but refused to reprimand MacArthur. The entire incident was another devastating negative for Hoover in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932]] election. That led New York governor and Democratic presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt to declare of Hoover: \"There is nothing inside the man but jelly!\"\n\n===1932 re-election campaign===\n[[File:Hoover Campaign.jpg|right|thumb|Hoover addresses a large crowd in his 1932 campaign.]]\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1932}}\nDespite the economic calamity facing the nation and his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the [[1932 Republican National Convention]]. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President [[Charles Dawes]], or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover.{{sfn|Fausold 1985|pp=194\u2013195}} Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]], defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House [[John Nance Garner]] was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the [[radio]] was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change the content of their speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.{{sfn|Carcasson 1998|p=349}}\n\nHoover originally planned to make only one or two major speeches, and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies, as sitting presidents had traditionally done. However, encouraged by Republican pleas and outraged by Democratic claims, Hoover entered the public fray. In his nine major radio addresses Hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy of government. Hoover urged voters to hold to the \"foundations of experience\", rejecting the notion that government interventionism could save the country from the Depression.{{sfn|Carcasson 1998|p=359}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1932.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|1932 electoral vote results.]]\n\nIn his campaign trips around the country, Hoover was faced with perhaps the most hostile crowds of any sitting president. Besides having his train and motorcades pelted with eggs and rotten fruit, he was often heckled while speaking, and on several occasions, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] halted attempts to kill Hoover by disgruntled citizens, including capturing one man nearing Hoover carrying sticks of dynamite, and another already having removed several spikes from the rails in front of the President's train.<ref name=\"time 2008\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1857862,00.html|work=Time|date=November 10, 2008|title=When New President Meets Old, It's Not Always Pretty|first= Nancy|last=Gibbs}}</ref>\n\nThe Democrats attacked Hoover as the cause of the Great Depression, and for being indifferent to the suffering of millions.{{sfn|Carcasson 1998|p=353}} As Governor of New York, Roosevelt had called on the New York legislature to provide aid for the needy, establishing Roosevelt's reputation for being more favorable toward government interventionism during the economic crisis.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=138\u2013140}} Fausold rejects the notion that the two nominees were similar ideologically, pointing to differences between the two on federal spending on public works, agricultural issues, Prohibition, and the tariff.{{sfn|Fausold 1985|pp=206\u2013208}}\n\nHoover's attempts to vindicate his administration fell on deaf ears, as much of the public blamed his administration for the depression.{{sfn|Carcasson 1998|pp=361\u2013362}} Roosevelt won 57.4 percent of the popular vote compared to Hoover's 39.7 percent.

Hoover expressed dismay at the persecution of Jews in Germany and believed that Hitler was mad, but did not present a threat to the U.S. Instead, Hoover believed that Roosevelt posed the biggest threat to peace, as he believed that Roosevelt provoked Japan and discouraged France and the United Kingdom from reaching an \"accommodation\" with Germany.<ref name=wsj10282017 /> After the September 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany, Hoover opposed United States intervention in [[World War II]], including the [[Lend-Lease]] policy.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=152\u2013154}}\n\nHoover became a vocal supporter of providing relief to countries in [[Nazi-occupied Europe]].<ref name=\"Walch2003\">{{Citation|author=Timothy Walch|title=Uncommon Americans: the lives and legacies of Herbert and Lou Henry Hoover|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3R2ikuvYV8C&pg=PA216|accessdate=March 1, 2011|date=September 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97996-6|page=216}}</ref> He was instrumental in creating the [[Commission for Polish Relief]] and [[Finnish Relief Fund]].<ref>[http://hoover.archives.gov/info/awards.html \"Foreign Relief Activities\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109172053/http://hoover.archives.gov/info/awards.html |date=January 9, 2011 }}, Herbert Hoover Public Positions and Honors</ref><ref name=\"Hoover1964\">{{Citation|author=Herbert Hoover|title=An American Epic: The guns cease killing and the saving of life from famine begins, 1939\u20131963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnU8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=March 1, 2011|year=1964|publisher=H.

Because of Hoover's experience with Germany at the end of World War I, in 1946 President Truman selected the former president to tour Germany to ascertain the food needs of the occupied nation. Hoover toured what was to become West Germany in Hermann G\u00f6ring's old train coach and produced [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|a number of reports]] critical of U.S. occupation policy. He said that the economy of Germany had \"sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Michael R | last = Beschloss | title = The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941\u20131945 | year = 2002 | page = 277}}</ref> He stated in one report:\n\n{{quote|There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the [[Historical Eastern Germany#Potsdam Conference|annexations]] can be reduced to a \"[[Morgenthau Plan|pastoral state]]\".

This became known as the [[Hoover Commission]]. Led by Hoover, the commission recommended changes designed to strengthen the president's ability to manage the federal government. Though Hoover had opposed FDR's concentration of power in the 1930s, he believed that a stronger presidency was required with the advent of the [[Atomic Age]]. In 1953, Hoover was appointed to a similar commission by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Despite the appointment, Hoover disliked Eisenhower, faulting the latter's failure to roll back the New Deal.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg 2009|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:Hhoover.jpeg|thumb|Hoover's official [[White House]] portrait painted by Elmer Wesley Greene.]]\n\nDespite his advancing years, Hoover continued to work nearly full-time both on writing (among his literary works is ''The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson'', a bestseller, and the first time one former president had ever written a biography about another), as well as overseeing the Hoover Institution at [[Stanford University]], which housed not only his own professional papers, but also those of a number of other former high-ranking governmental and military servants.

Starting with the 1948 convention, Hoover was feted as the guest of \"farewell\" ceremonies, with the unspoken assumption that the aging former president might not survive until the next convention. In 1960, Hoover appeared at his final Republican National Convention. Joking to the delegates he said \"Apparently, my last three good-byes didn't take\". Although he lived to see the 1964 convention, ill health prevented him from attending, and his absence was acknowledged in presidential nominee [[Barry Goldwater]]'s acceptance speech. In 1962, Hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed. Ten months later he had severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seemed terminally ill and frail, but his mind was clear and he maintained a great deal of correspondence. Although the illness would get worse over time, he refused to be hospitalized.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nHoover died following massive [[internal bleeding]] at the age of 90 in his New York City suite at 11:35&nbsp;a.m. on October 20, 1964,<ref>{{Cite news|title = Herbert Hoover Is Dead; Ex-President, 90, Served Country in Varied Fields | url = https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0810.html | date =October 21, 1964|first=McCandlish|last=Phillips|work= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate= July 2, 2011}}</ref> 31 years, seven months, and sixteen days after leaving office.

The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans.

When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, \"Hildegard\", ''MGG.''</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe.

A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground.

In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the \"voice of the Living Light.\"\n\n====''Scivias''====\n[[File:Meister des Hildegardis-Codex 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Church, the Bride of Christ and Mother of the Faithful in Baptism. Illustration to ''Scivias'' II.3, fol. 51r from the 20th-century facsimile of the Rupertsberg manuscript, c. 1165\u20131180]]\nThe composition of the first work, ''[[Scivias]]'', was triggered by the insistence of her visionary experiences in about 1142, when she was already forty-three years old. Perceiving a divine command to \"write down what you see and hear\",<ref>\"Protestificatio\" (\"Declaration\") to Hildegard of Bingen, ''Scivias'', trans. Mother Columba Hart and Jane Bishop (Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 59\u201361.</ref> Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences. ''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.\n\nPortions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to [[Pope Eugenius III]] at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing.<ref>Letter 4 in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans.

She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defense, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''The Book of the Rewards of Life''. Trans. Bruce W.

Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.<ref>\"The Life of Hildegard\", II.16, in ''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe, and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1-14), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that comprises the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1-2:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.<ref>St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=9780813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi\u2013xii</ref> In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nHildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.<ref name=\"medical\">Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).</ref> Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.<ref name=Sweet/> Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[M\u00e9lanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|isbn=|location=New York|pages=194\u2013201|via=}}.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.<ref name=Glaze/> Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.<ref name=\"Sweet\" /> Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"<ref name=Glaze/> In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ of body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.<ref name=Sweet/> Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.<ref name=Glaze/> For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).<ref name=Sweet/> Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.<ref name=encyclopedia>\"Hildegard of Bingen.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.</ref>\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\"<ref name=Glaze/> Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements\u2014blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.<ref name=Glaze/> As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:\n\n<blockquote>It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.<ref>Quoted in Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" p. 136.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Lingua Ignota'' and invented alphabet===\n[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]\n\nHildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.<ref name=\"Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002\"/> Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkuK53bU4_UC ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language: An Edition, Translation, and Discussion''], ed.

Herrick|Herrick, James A.]], ''The History of Rhetoric: An Introduction'', 4th ed. (Boston: Allyn Bacon, 2005), pp. ??.</ref> Hildegard's participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women's social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford.

Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman, \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,\" ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163\u201375; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).</ref> Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].\n\nHildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic.

Located in the heart of the [[Gooi]], it is the largest urban centre in that area. It is surrounded by [[heathland]], [[Forest|wood]]s, [[meadow]]s, lakes, and smaller towns. Hilversum is part of the [[Randstad]], one of the largest [[conurbation]]s in [[Europe]].\n\n== Town ==\nHilversum lies {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Amsterdam]] and {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The town is known for its architecturally important [[Hilversum Town Hall|Town Hall (Raadhuis Hilversum)]], designed by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and built in 1931.\n\nHilversum has one public library, two swimming pools (Van Hellemond Sport and De Lieberg), a number of sporting halls and several shopping centres (such as Hilvertshof, De Gijsbrecht, Kerkelanden, Riebeeck Galerij and Seinhorst). Locally, the town centre is known as ''het dorp'', which means \"the village\".\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nHilversum is often called \"media city\", since it is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands, and is home to an extensive complex of radio and television [[studio]]s and to the administrative headquarters of the multiple broadcasting organizations which make up the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] system. Hilversum is also home to many newer commercial TV production companies. [[Radio Netherlands]], which has been broadcasting worldwide via [[shortwave radio]] since the 1920s, is also based here.\n\nThe following is a list of organizations that have, or are continuing to, broadcast from studios in Hilversum:\n\n* [[NCRV]] (1924\u20132013)\n* [[KRO]] (1925\u20132013)\n* [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]] (1925\u20132013)\n* [[VPRO]] (1926\u2013present)\n* [[AVRO]] (1927\u20132013)\n* [[Omroep NTR#History|RVU]] (1930\u20132010)\n* [[Interkerkelijk Overleg inzake Radioaangelegenheden|IKOR]] (1946\u20131975)\n* [[Nederlandse Radio Unie|NRU]] (1947\u20131969)\n* [[Radio Nederland Wereldomroep|RNW]] (1947\u20132012)\n* [[Nederlandse Televisie Stichting|NTS]] (1951\u20131969)\n* [[Interkerkelijke Omroep Nederland|IKON]] (1976\u20132015)\n* [[Nederlandse Onderwijs Televisie|NOT]] (1962\u20131996)\n* [[Teleac (broadcaster)|Teleac]] (1963\u20132010)\n* [[TROS]] (1964\u20132013)\n* [[Evangelische Omroep|EO]] (1967\u2013present)\n* [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] (1969\u2013present)\n* [[Veronica (media)|VOO]] (1976\u20131995)\n* [[Humanistische Omroep|Human]] (1989\u2013present)\n* [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting|NPS]] (1995\u20132010)\n* [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] (1997\u20132013)\n* [[Omroep MAX|MAX]] (2005\u2013present)\n* [[PowNed]] (2009\u2013present)\n* [[Wakker Nederland|WNL]] (2009\u2013present)\n* [[Omroep NTR|NTR]] (2010\u2013present)\n* [[AVROTROS]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[BNN-VARA|BNNVARA]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[KRO-NCRV]] (2014\u2013present)\n\nOne result of the town's history as an important radio transmission centre is that many older radio sets throughout Europe featured ''Hilversum'' as a pre-marked dial position on their tuning scales.\n\nDutch national voting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] is normally co-ordinated from Hilversum.\n\n== History ==\nEarthenware found in Hilversum gives its name to the [[Hilversum culture]], which is an early- to mid-Bronze Age, or 800\u20131200 BCE [[material culture]]. Artifacts from this prehistoric civilization bear similarities to the Wessex Culture of southern Britain and may indicate that the first Hilversum residents emigrated from that area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Hilversum/Overview/History |title=Hilversum: Overview - History |publisher=Iguide.travel |accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> The first brick settlements formed around 900, but it was not until 1305 that the first official mention of Hilversum (\"Hilfersheem\" from \"Hilvertshem\" meaning \"houses between the hills\") is found. At that point it was a part of [[Naarden]], the oldest town in the Gooi area.\n\n[[File:Johannes Bosboom - Interieur van een boerendeel bij Hilversum.jpg|thumb|left|''Interior of a farm near Hilversum'', a 19th-century drawing by [[Johannes Bosboom]]]]\nFarming, raising sheep and some wool manufacturing were the means of life for the Gooi in the Middle Ages. In 1424, on 21 March at 6:30&nbsp;am (the hour at which people got up, as the farm was full of restless and loud animals), Hilversum received its first official independent status. This made possible further growth in the village because permission from Naarden was no longer needed for new industrial development. The town grew further in the 17th century when the Dutch economy as a whole entered its age of prosperity, and several canals were built connecting it indirectly to Amsterdam. In 1725 and 1766 large fires destroyed most of the town, leveling parts of the old townhouse and the church next to it. The town overcame these setbacks and the textile industry continued to develop, among other ways by devising a way to weave cows' hair.  In the 19th century a substantial textile and tapestry industry emerged, aided by a railway link to Amsterdam in 1874.  From that time the town grew quickly with rich commuters from Amsterdam moving in, building themselves large villas in the wooded surroundings, and gradually starting to live in Hilversum permanently.  Despite this growth, Hilversum was never granted [[city rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] so it is still referred to by many locals as \"het dorp,\" or \"the village.\"\n\nFor the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in neighboring [[Amsterdam]], it hosted all of the non-jumping [[Equestrian at the 1928 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and the running part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] event.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408184510/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1928/1928.pdf 1928 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 271\u20138.</ref> The city was the headquarters of the German ground forces ([[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]) in the Netherlands {{citation needed|reason=Time reference needed|date=April 2015}}.\n\nThe ''Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek'' (NSF) company established a professional transmitter and radio factory in Hilversum in the early 1920s, growing into the largest of its kind in the Netherlands, and in 1948 being taken over by [[Philips]]. By then the textile industry had started its decline; only one factory, Veneta, managed to continue into the 1960s, when it also had to close its doors. Another major industry, the chemical factory IFF, also closed by the end of the 1960s. In the meantime, almost all Dutch radio broadcasting organizations (followed by television broadcasters in the 1950s) established their headquarters in Hilversum and provided a source of continuing economic growth.  The concentration of broadcasters in Hilversum has given it its enduring status as the media city for the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1964, the population reached a record high \u2013 over 103,000 people called Hilversum home.  The current population hovers around 85,000.  Several factors figure into the decline:  one is the fact that the average family nowadays consists of fewer people, so fewer people live in each house; second, the town is virtually unable to expand because all the surrounding lands were sold by city architect [[Willem Marinus Dudok|W.M. Dudok]] to the [[Goois Natuurreservaat]] (''[[:nl:Goois Natuurreservaat|nl]]''). The third reason for this decline of the population was because the property values were increasing rapidly in that moment of time, and many people were forced to move to less expensive areas in the Netherlands.\n\nSome sources blame connections in the television world for attracting crime to Hilversum; the town has had to cope with mounting drug-related issues in a community with higher than average unemployment and ongoing housing shortage.\n\nHilversum was one of the first towns to have a local party of the populist movement called [[Livable Netherlands|''Leefbaar'' (\"liveable\")]]. Founded by former social-democrat party strongman Jan Nagel, it was initially held at bay for alderman positions. In 2001, Nagel from 'Leefbaar Hilversum' teamed up with 'Leefbaar Utrecht' leaders to found a national 'Leefbaar Nederland' party. By strange coincidence, in 2002 the most vocal 'Leefbaar Rotterdam' politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] was shot and killed by an animal rights activist at [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Hilversum Media Park]] just after finishing a radio interview. This happened, however, after a break between Fortuyn and Nagel during a Leefbaar Nederland board meeting in Hilversum on Fortuyn's anti-Islamic viewpoints.\n\nThe town of Hilversum has put a great deal of effort into improvements, including a recent renovation to its central train station, thorough renovation of the main shopping centre (Hilvertshof), and development of new dining and retail districts downtown including the \"vintage\" district in the Leeuwenstraat.  Several notable architectural accomplishments include the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision|Institute for Sound and Vision]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |title=Beeld en Geluid |publisher=Experience.beeldengeluid.nl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118210918/http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |archivedate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> and [[Zanderij Crailoo]] (''[[:nl:Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo|nl]]''), the largest man-made [[wildlife crossing]] in the world.\n\nThe nearby [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Media Park]] was the scene of [[Assassination of Pim Fortuyn|the 2002 assassination]] of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]]; in 2015, a gunman carrying a false pistol stormed into [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]]'s headquarters, demanding airtime on the evening news.\n\nThe population declined from 103,000 in 1964 to 84,000 in 2006.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Reproductie uit gedenkboek \"Het werk van Dr.P.J.

As the hound follows the hare, never ceasing in its running, ever drawing nearer in the chase, with unhurrying and imperturbed pace, so does God follow the fleeing soul by His Divine grace. And though in sin or in human love, away from God it seeks to hide itself, Divine grace follows after, unwearyingly follows ever after, till the soul feels its pressure forcing it to turn to Him alone in that never ending pursuit.\" J.F.X.

Such communication systems were typically limited to point to point communication between two end devices. [[Telegraphy|Telegraph systems]] and [[Teletypewriter eXchange|telex machines]] can be considered early precursors of this kind of communication. The [[Telegraph]] in the late 19th century was the first fully digital communication system.\n\nFundamental theoretical work in [[data transmission]] and [[information theory]] was developed by [[Claude Shannon]], [[Harry Nyquist]], and [[Ralph Hartley]] in the early 20th century.\n\nEarly computers had a central processing unit and remote terminals. As the technology evolved, new systems were devised to allow communication over longer distances (for terminals) or with higher speed (for interconnection of local devices) that were necessary for the [[mainframe computer]] model. These technologies made it possible to exchange data (such as files) between remote computers. However, the point-to-point communication model was limited, as it did not allow for direct communication between any two arbitrary systems; a physical link was necessary. The technology was also considered unsafe for strategic and military use because there were no alternative paths for the communication in case of an enemy attack.\n\n==Development of wide area networking==\n\nWith limited exceptions, the earliest computers were connected directly to terminals used by individual users, typically in the same building or site. Such networks became known as [[local area network]]s (LANs). Networking beyond this scope, known as [[wide area network]]s (WANs), emerged during the 1950s and became established during the 1960s.\n\n===Inspiration===\n\n[[J. C. R.

There he formed an informal group within DARPA to further computer research.

Building on ideas developed in [[ALOHAnet]], the ARPANET grew rapidly. By 1981, the number of hosts had grown to 213, with a new host being added approximately every twenty days.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hafner| first = Katie| authorlink = Katie Hafner| title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet| year = 1998| publisher = Simon & Schuster| isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=[[Ronda Hauben]] | title=From the ARPANET to the Internet | year=2001 | url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/other/tcpdigest_paper.txt | accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nARPANET development was centered around the [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) process, still used today for proposing and distributing Internet Protocols and Systems. RFC 1, entitled \"Host Software\", was written by [[Steve Crocker]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and published on April 7, 1969. These early years were documented in the 1972 film [[Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing]].\n\nARPANET became the technical core of what would become the Internet, and a primary tool in developing the technologies used. The early ARPANET used the [[Network Control Program]] (NCP, sometimes Network Control Protocol) rather than [[TCP/IP]]. On January 1, 1983, known as [[Flag day (software)|flag day]], NCP on the ARPANET was replaced by the more flexible and powerful family of TCP/IP protocols, marking the start of the modern Internet.<ref>{{cite IETF\n| title = NCP/TCP transition plan\n| rfc = 801\n| sectionname = The General Plan\n| page = 2\n| last1 = Postel\n| first1 = J.\n| authorlink1 = Jon Postel\n| year = 1981\n| month = November\n| publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n| accessdate = February 1, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nInternational collaborations on ARPANET were sparse. For various political reasons, European developers were concerned with developing the [[X.25]] networks.

First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally. It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself, using [[Datagrams#Packets vs. datagrams|unreliable datagrams]] and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms.

While using [[packet switching]], X.25 is built on the concept of virtual circuits emulating traditional telephone connections. In 1974, X.25 formed the basis for the SERCnet network between British academic and research sites, which later became [[JANET]]. The initial ITU Standard on X.25 was approved in March 1976.<ref>{{cite web|author=tsbedh |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/history.html |title=History of X.25, CCITT Plenary Assemblies and Book Colors |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|British Post Office]], [[Western Union|Western Union International]] and [[Tymnet]] collaborated to create the first international packet switched network, referred to as the [[International Packet Switched Service]] (IPSS), in 1978. This network grew from Europe and the US to cover Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia by 1981.

[[Telenet]] offered its Telemail electronic mail service, which was also targeted to enterprise use rather than the general email system of the ARPANET.\n\nThe first public dial-in networks used asynchronous [[Teleprinter|TTY]] terminal protocols to reach a concentrator operated in the public network. Some networks, such as [[CompuServe]], used X.25 to multiplex the terminal sessions into their packet-switched backbones, while others, such as [[Tymnet]], used proprietary protocols. In 1979, [[CompuServe]] became the first service to offer [[e-mail|electronic mail]] capabilities and technical support to personal computer users. The company broke new ground again in 1980 as the first to offer [[online chat|real-time chat]] with its [[CB Simulator]]. Other major dial-in networks were [[America Online]] (AOL) and [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] that also provided communications, content, and entertainment features. Many [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) networks also provided on-line access, such as [[FidoNet]] which was popular amongst hobbyist computer users, many of them [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] and [[amateur radio operator]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n====UUCP and Usenet====\n{{Main|UUCP|Usenet}}\nIn 1979, two students at [[Duke University]], [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]], originated the idea of using [[Bourne shell]] scripts to transfer news and messages on a serial line [[UUCP]] connection with nearby [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Following public release of the software in 1980, the mesh of UUCP hosts forwarding on the Usenet news rapidly expanded. UUCPnet, as it would later be named, also created gateways and links between [[FidoNet]] and dial-up BBS hosts. UUCP networks spread quickly due to the lower costs involved, ability to use existing leased lines, [[X.25]] links or even [[ARPANET]] connections, and the lack of strict use policies compared to later networks like [[CSNET]] and [[Bitnet]]. All connects were local. By 1981 the number of UUCP hosts had grown to 550, nearly doubling to 940 in 1984. \u2013 [[Sublink Network]], operating since 1987 and officially founded in Italy in 1989, based its interconnectivity upon UUCP to redistribute mail and news groups messages throughout its Italian nodes (about 100 at the time) owned both by private individuals and small companies. [[Sublink Network]] represented possibly one of the first examples of the Internet technology becoming progress through popular diffusion.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/uucp-internals/ UUCP Internals Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>\n\n===Merging the networks and creating the Internet (1973\u201395)===\n[[File:Internet map in February 82.png|right|thumb|Map of the [[TCP/IP]] test network in February 1982]]\n\n====TCP/IP====\n{{Main|Internet Protocol Suite}}\nWith so many different network methods, something was needed to unify them. [[Robert E. Kahn]] of [[DARPA]] and [[ARPANET]] recruited [[Vinton Cerf]] of [[Stanford University]] to work with him on the problem. By 1973, they had worked out a fundamental reformulation, where the differences between network protocols were hidden by using a common [[internetwork protocol]], and instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the ARPANET, the hosts became responsible. Cerf credits [[Hubert Zimmermann]], Gerard LeLann and [[Louis Pouzin]] (designer of the [[CYCLADES]] network) with important work on this design.<ref>{{cite arxiv | author=[[Barry M.

DARPA agreed to fund development of prototype software, and after several years of work, the first demonstration of a gateway between the [[Packet Radio]] network in the SF Bay area and the ARPANET was conducted by the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]].

DARPA sponsored or encouraged the development of TCP/IP implementations for many operating systems and then scheduled a migration of all hosts on all of its packet networks to TCP/IP. On January 1, 1983, known as [[flag day (software)|flag day]], TCP/IP protocols became the only approved protocol on the ARPANET, replacing the earlier [[Network Control Program|NCP protocol]].<ref>[[Jon Postel]], NCP/TCP Transition Plan, RFC 801</ref>\n\n====From ARPANET to NSFNET====\n{{Main|ARPANET|NSFNET}}\n[[File:InetCirca85.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[BBN Technologies]] TCP/IP Internet map of early 1986.]]\n\nAfter the ARPANET had been up and running for several years, ARPA looked for another agency to hand off the network to; ARPA's primary mission was funding cutting edge research and development, not running a communications utility. Eventually, in July 1975, the network had been turned over to the [[Defense Communications Agency]], also part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. In 1983, the [[U.S. military]] portion of the ARPANET was broken off as a separate network, the [[MILNET]]. MILNET subsequently became the unclassified but military-only [[NIPRNET]], in parallel with the SECRET-level [[SIPRNET]] and [[JWICS]] for TOP SECRET and above. NIPRNET does have controlled security gateways to the public Internet.\n\nThe networks based on the ARPANET were government funded and therefore restricted to noncommercial uses such as research; unrelated commercial use was strictly forbidden. This initially restricted connections to military sites and universities. During the 1980s, the connections expanded to more educational institutions, and even to a growing number of companies such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], which were participating in research projects or providing services to those who were.\n\nSeveral other branches of the [[U.S. government]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) became heavily involved in Internet research and started development of a successor to ARPANET. In the mid-1980s, all three of these branches developed the first Wide Area Networks based on TCP/IP. NASA developed the [[NASA Science Network]], NSF developed [[CSNET]] and DOE evolved the [[Energy Sciences Network]] or ESNet.\n\n[[File:NSFNET-backbone-T3.png|thumb|320px|right|T3 NSFNET Backbone, c. 1992]]\nNASA developed the TCP/IP based NASA Science Network (NSN) in the mid-1980s, connecting space scientists to data and information stored anywhere in the world. In 1989, the [[DECnet]]-based Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) and the TCP/IP-based NASA Science Network (NSN) were brought together at NASA Ames Research Center creating the first multiprotocol wide area network called the NASA Science Internet, or NSI. NSI was established to provide a totally integrated communications infrastructure to the NASA scientific community for the advancement of earth, space and life sciences. As a high-speed, multiprotocol, international network, NSI provided connectivity to over 20,000 scientists across all seven continents.\n\nIn 1981 NSF supported the development of the [[CSNET|Computer Science Network]] (CSNET). CSNET connected with ARPANET using TCP/IP, and ran TCP/IP over [[X.25]], but it also supported departments without sophisticated network connections, using automated dial-up mail exchange.\n\nIn 1986, the NSF created [[NSFNET]], a 56&nbsp;kbit/s [[Internet backbone|backbone]] to support the NSF-sponsored [[Supercomputers|supercomputing]] centers. The NSFNET also provided support for the creation of regional research and education networks in the United States, and for the connection of university and college campus networks to the regional networks.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=David Roessner |author2=Barry Bozeman |author3=Irwin Feller |author4=Christopher Hill |author5=Nils Newman |title=The Role of NSF's Support of Engineering in Enabling Technological Innovation |year=1997 |url=http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/techin/inter2.html |accessdate=May 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219114437/http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/techin/inter2.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The use of NSFNET and the regional networks was not limited to supercomputer users and the 56&nbsp;kbit/s network quickly became overloaded. NSFNET was upgraded to 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s in 1988 under a cooperative agreement with the [[Merit Network]] in partnership with [[IBM]], [[MCI Communications|MCI]], and the [[State of Michigan]]. The existence of NSFNET and the creation of [[Federal Internet Exchange]]s (FIXes) allowed the ARPANET to be decommissioned in 1990. NSFNET was expanded and upgraded to 45&nbsp;Mbit/s in 1991, and was decommissioned in 1995 when it was replaced by backbones operated by several commercial [[Internet Service Providers]].\n\n====Transition towards the Internet====\nThe term \"internet\" was adopted in the first RFC published on the TCP protocol (RFC 675:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675 |title=RFC 675 \u2013 Specification of internet transmission control program |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref> Internet Transmission Control Program, December 1974) as an abbreviation of the term ''internetworking'' and the two terms were used interchangeably. In general, an internet was any network using TCP/IP. It was around the time when ARPANET was interlinked with [[NSFNET]] in the late 1980s, that the term was used as the name of the network, Internet, being the large and global TCP/IP network.<ref>{{cite book| last = Tanenbaum| first = Andrew S.| authorlink = Andrew S. Tanenbaum| title = Computer Networks| year = 1996| publisher = Prentice Hall| isbn = 0-13-394248-1 }}</ref>\n\nAs interest in networking grew and new applications for it were developed, the Internet's technologies spread throughout the rest of the world. The network-agnostic approach in TCP/IP meant that it was easy to use any existing network infrastructure, such as the [[International Packet Switched Service|IPSS]] X.25 network, to carry Internet traffic. In 1982, one year earlier than ARPANET, University College London replaced its transatlantic satellite links with TCP/IP over IPSS.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Olivier|title=The \"Hidden\" Prehistory of European Research Networking|date=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=1466938722|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eTRYAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT17&lpg=PT17&source=bl&ots=UsJjMrqp-1&sig=tmFqs3B3Y6LDuMNmnc73z1_3f_E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqjJTC1b7WAhVJsBQKHQjcA94Q6AEISTAF#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Internet: On its International Origins and Collaborative Vision|journal=Amateur Computerist|year=2004|first=Ronda|last=Hauben|volume=12|issue=2|pages= |url=http://www.ais.org/~jrh/acn/ACn12-2.a03.txt|accessdate=May 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMany sites unable to link directly to the Internet created simple gateways for the transfer of electronic mail, the most important application of the time. Sites with only intermittent connections used [[UUCP]] or [[FidoNet]] and relied on the gateways between these networks and the Internet. Some gateway services went beyond simple mail peering, such as allowing access to [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) sites via UUCP or mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cac.psu.edu/pub/internexus/ACCESS.PROVIDRS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020112024958/http://ftp.cac.psu.edu/pub/internexus/ACCESS.PROVIDRS|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 12, 2002|title=Internet Access Provider Lists|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFinally, routing technologies were developed for the Internet to remove the remaining centralized routing aspects. The [[Exterior Gateway Protocol]] (EGP) was replaced by a new protocol, the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP). This provided a meshed topology for the Internet and reduced the centric architecture which ARPANET had emphasized. In 1994, [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) was introduced to support better conservation of address space which allowed use of [[supernet|route aggregation]] to decrease the size of [[routing table]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1871 |title=RFC 1871 \u2013 CIDR and Classful Routing |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===TCP/IP goes global (1980s)===\n\n====CERN, the European Internet, the link to the Pacific and beyond====\nBetween 1984 and 1988 [[CERN]] began installation and operation of [[TCP/IP]] to interconnect its major internal computer systems, workstations, PCs and an accelerator control system. CERN continued to operate a limited self-developed system (CERNET) internally and several incompatible (typically proprietary) network protocols externally. There was considerable resistance in Europe towards more widespread use of [[TCP/IP]], and the CERN TCP/IP intranets remained isolated from the Internet until 1989.\n\nIn 1988, Daniel Karrenberg, from [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica]] (CWI) in [[Amsterdam]], visited Ben Segal, [[CERN]]'s TCP/IP Coordinator, looking for advice about the transition of the European side of the UUCP Usenet network (much of which ran over X.25 links) over to TCP/IP. In 1987, Ben Segal had met with [[Len Bosack]] from the then still small company [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] about purchasing some TCP/IP routers for CERN, and was able to give Karrenberg advice and forward him on to Cisco for the appropriate hardware. This expanded the European portion of the Internet across the existing UUCP networks, and in 1989 CERN opened its first external TCP/IP connections.<ref>{{cite journal | author=[[Ben Segal]] | title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN | year=1995 | url=http://www.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html}}</ref> This coincided with the creation of R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens ([[RIPE]]), initially a group of IP network administrators who met regularly to carry out coordination work together. Later, in 1992, RIPE was formally registered as a [[cooperative]] in Amsterdam.\n\nAt the same time as the rise of internetworking in Europe, ad hoc networking to ARPA and in-between Australian universities formed, based on various technologies such as X.25 and [[UUCP]]Net. These were limited in their connection to the global networks, due to the cost of making individual international UUCP dial-up or X.25 connections. In 1989, Australian universities joined the push towards using IP protocols to unify their networking infrastructures. [[AARNet]] was formed in 1989 by the [[Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee]] and provided a dedicated IP based network for Australia.\n\nThe Internet began to penetrate Asia in the 1980s. In May 1982 [[South Korea]] became the second country to successfully set up TCP/IP IPv4 network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/koreainternethistory/publication/brief-history-korea-eng-ver|title=A Brief History of the Internet in Korea (2005) - \ud55c\uad6d \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uc5ed\uc0ac \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_economyplus_detail.htm?No=3390|title=Three decades since the introduction of the internet in Korea|website=world.kbs.co.kr|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Japan, which had built the UUCP-based network [[JUNET]] in 1984, connected to [[NSFNET]] in 1989.

The data connection was originally carried by a C-Band RSCC Russian satellite which connected InfoMail's Kampala offices directly to NSN's MAE-West point of presence using a private network from NSN's leased ground station in New Jersey. InfoCom's first satellite connection was just 64 kbit/s, serving a Sun host computer and twelve US Robotics dial-up modems.\n\nIn 1996, a [[USAID]] funded project, the [[Leland Initiative]], started work on developing full Internet connectivity for the continent. [[Guinea]], Mozambique, [[Madagascar]] and [[Rwanda]] gained [[satellite earth station]]s in 1997, followed by [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Benin]] in 1998.\n\nAfrica is building an Internet infrastructure.

In terms of providing context for this period, [[cellphone|mobile cellular devices]] (\"smartphones\" and other cellular devices) which today provide near-universal access, were used for business and not a routine household item owned by parents and children worldwide. [[Social media]] in the modern sense had yet to come into existence, laptops were bulky and most households did not have computers. Data rates were slow and most people lacked means to video or digitize video; media storage was transitioning slowly from [[analog signal|analog]] tape to [[digital data|digital]] [[optical disc]]s ([[DVD]] and to an extent still, [[floppy disc]] to [[CD]]). Enabling technologies used from the early 2000s such as [[PHP]], modern [[Javascript]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], technologies such as [[AJAX]], [[HTML 4]] (and its emphasis on [[CSS]]), and various [[software framework]]s, which enabled and simplified speed of web development, largely awaited invention and their eventual widespread adoption.\n\nThe Internet was widely used for [[mailing list]]s, [[email]]s, [[e-commerce]] and early popular [[online shopping]] ([[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]] for example), [[online forum]]s and [[bulletin board]]s, and personal websites and [[blog]]s, and use was growing rapidly, but by more modern standards the systems used were static and lacked widespread social engagement. It awaited a number of events in the early 2000s to change from a communications technology to gradually develop into a key part of global society's infrastructure.\n\nTypical design elements of these \"Web 1.0\" era websites included:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viswanathan|first1=Ganesh|last2=Dutt Mathur|first2=Punit|last3=Yammiyavar|first3=Pradeep|title=From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and beyond: Reviewing usability heuristic criteria taking music sites as case studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/8381037/From_Web_1.0_to_Web_2.0_and_beyond_Reviewing_usability_heuristic_criteria_taking_music_sites_as_case_studies|date=March 2010|place=Mumbai|accessdate=20 February 2015|series=IndiaHCI Conference}}</ref> Static pages instead of [[dynamic HTML]];<ref>[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-101.htm Web 1.0 defined \u2013 How stuff works]</ref> content served from [[filesystem]]s instead of [[relational database]]s; pages built using [[Server Side Includes]] or [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] instead of a [[web application]] written in a [[dynamic programming language]]; [[HTML 3.2]]-era structures such as [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] and tables to create page layouts; online [[guestbook]]s; overuse of [[GIF]] buttons and similar small graphics promoting particular items;<ref>[http://www.complexify.com/buttons/ \"Web 1.0 Revisited \u2013 Too many stupid buttons\"].

However this only temporarily slowed enthusiasm and growth, which quickly recovered and continued to grow.\n\nThe changes that would propel the Internet into its place as a social system took place during a relatively short period of no more than five years, starting from around 2004. They included:\n\n:* The call to \"[[Web 2.0]]\" in 2004 (first suggested in 1999),\n:* Accelerating adoption and commoditization among households of, and familiarity with, the necessary hardware (such as computers).\n:* Accelerating storage technology and data access speeds \u2013 [[hard drive]]s emerged, took over from far smaller, slower [[floppy disc]]s, and grew from [[megabyte]]s to [[gigabyte]]s (and by around 2010, [[terabyte]]s), [[Random-access memory|RAM]] from hundreds of [[kilobyte]]s to gigabytes as typical amounts on a system, and [[Ethernet]], the enabling technology for TCP/IP, moved from common speeds of kilobits to tens of megabits per second, to gigabits per second.\n:* High speed Internet and wider coverage of data connections, at lower prices, allowing larger traffic rates, more reliable simpler traffic, and traffic from more locations,\n:* The gradually accelerating perception of the ability of computers to create new means and approaches to communication, the emergence of social media and websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] to their later prominence, and global collaborations such as [[Wikipedia]] (which existed before but gained prominence as a result),\nand shortly after (approximately 2007\u20132008 onward):\n:* The [[mobile revolution]], which provided access to the Internet to much of human society of all ages, in their daily lives, and allowed them to share, discuss, and continually update, inquire, and respond.\n:* [[Non-volatile RAM]] rapidly grew in size and reliability, and decreased in price, becoming a commodity capable of enabling high levels of computing activity on these small handheld devices as well as [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD).\n:* An emphasis on power efficient processor and device design, rather than purely high processing power; one of the beneficiaries of this was [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], a British company which had focused since the 1980s on powerful but low cost simple microprocessors. [[ARM architecture]] rapidly gained dominance in the market for mobile and embedded devices.\nWith the call to Web 2.0, the period up to around 2004\u20132005 was retrospectively named and described by some as Web 1.0.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Web 2.0====\n{{main|Web 2.0|Responsive web design}}\n\nThe term \"Web 2.0\" describes [[website]]s that emphasize [[user-generated content]] (including user-to-user interaction), [[usability]], and [[Web API|interoperability]].

This [[mobile revolution]] meant that computers in the form of smartphones became something many people used, took with them everywhere, communicated with, used for photographs and videos they instantly shared or to shop or seek information \"on the move\" \u2013 and used socially, as opposed to items on a desk at home or just used for work.\n\nLocation-based services, services using location and other sensor information, and [[crowdsourcing]] (frequently but not always location based), became common, with posts tagged by location, or websites and services becoming location aware. Mobile-targeted websites (such as \"m.website.com\") became common, designed especially for the new devices used. [[Netbook]]s, [[ultrabook]]s, widespread [[4G]] and [[Wi-Fi]], and mobile chips capable or running at nearly the power of desktops from not many years before on far lower power usage, became enablers of this stage of Internet development, and the term \"[[App (disambiguation)|App]]\" emerged (short for \"Application program\" or \"Program\") as did the \"[[App store]]\".\n\n===Networking in outer space===\n{{Main|Interplanetary Internet}}\nThe first Internet link into [[low earth orbit]] was established on January 22, 2010 when astronaut [[Timothy Creamer|T.

Each such data link must be manually scheduled and configured. In the late 1990s NASA and Google began working on a new network protocol, [[Delay-tolerant networking]] (DTN) which automates this process, allows networking of spaceborne transmission nodes, and takes the fact into account that spacecraft can temporarily lose contact because they move behind the Moon or planets, or because [[space weather]] disrupts the connection. Under such conditions, DTN retransmits data packages instead of dropping them, as the standard TCP/IP Internet Protocol does.

As a result, the [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) was established as in December 1997, as an independent, not-for-profit corporation by direction of the [[National Science Foundation]] and became the third Regional Internet Registry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Moves Toward Privatization|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=102819|work=www.nsf.gov|date=24 June 1997}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, both the IANA and remaining DNS-related InterNIC functions were reorganized under the control of [[ICANN]], a California [[non-profit corporation]] contracted by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to manage a number of Internet-related tasks. As these tasks involved technical coordination for two principal Internet name spaces (DNS names and IP addresses) created by the IETF, ICANN also signed a memorandum of understanding with the IAB to define the technical work to be carried out by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.<ref>{{cite web | title=RFC 2860| work=Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority | url=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2860.txt |accessdate=December 26, 2005}}</ref> The management of Internet address space remained with the regional Internet registries, which collectively were defined as a supporting organization within the ICANN structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws|title=ICANN Bylaws|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> ICANN provides central coordination for the DNS system, including policy coordination for the split registry / registrar system, with competition among registry service providers to serve each top-level-domain and multiple competing registrars offering DNS services to end-users.\n\n===Internet Engineering Task Force===\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) is the largest and most visible of several loosely related ad-hoc groups that provide technical direction for the Internet, including the [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB), the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), and the [[Internet Research Task Force]] (IRTF).\n\nThe IETF is a loosely self-organized group of international volunteers who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet standard specifications. Much of the work of the IETF is organized into ''Working Groups''. Standardization efforts of the Working Groups are often adopted by the Internet community, but the IETF does not control or patrol the Internet.<ref name=\"FYI17\">\"The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force\", FYI 17 and RFC 4677, P. Hoffman and S. Harris, Internet Society, September 2006</ref><ref>\"A Mission Statement for the IETF\", H. Alvestrand, Internet Society, BCP 95 and RFC 3935, October 2004</ref>\n\nThe IETF grew out of quarterly meeting of U.S. government-funded researchers, starting in January 1986. Non-government representatives were invited by the fourth IETF meeting in October 1986. The concept of Working Groups was introduced at the fifth meeting in February 1987. The seventh meeting in July 1987 was the first meeting with more than one hundred attendees. In 1992, the [[Internet Society]], a professional membership society, was formed and IETF began to operate under it as an independent international standards body. The first IETF meeting outside of the United States was held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July 1993. Today, the IETF meets three times per year and attendance has been as high as ca. 2,000 participants. Typically one in three IETF meetings are held in Europe or Asia. The number of non-US attendees is typically ca. 50%, even at meetings held in the United States.<ref name=FYI17/>\n\nThe IETF is not a legal entity, has no governing board, no members, and no dues. The closest status resembling membership is being on an IETF or Working Group mailing list. IETF volunteers come from all over the world and from many different parts of the Internet community. The IETF works closely with and under the supervision of the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG)<ref>\"An IESG charter\", H. Alvestrand, RFC 3710, Internet Society, February 2004</ref> and the [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB).<ref>\"Charter of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\", B.

Floyd, V. Paxson, A. Falk (eds), RFC 4440, Internet Society, March 2006</ref>\n\n====Request for Comments====\n[[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) are the main documentation for the work of the IAB, IESG, IETF, and IRTF. RFC 1, \"Host Software\", was written by Steve Crocker at [[UCLA]] in April 1969, well before the IETF was created. Originally they were technical memos documenting aspects of ARPANET development and were edited by [[Jon Postel]], the first [[RFC Editor]].<ref name=FYI17/><ref name=\"RFC4844\">\"The RFC Series and RFC Editor\", L. Daigle, RFC 4844, Internet Society, July 2007</ref>\n\nRFCs cover a wide range of information from proposed standards, draft standards, full standards, best practices, experimental protocols, history, and other informational topics.<ref>\"Not All RFCs are Standards\", C. Huitema, J. Postel, S. Crocker, RFC 1796, Internet Society, April 1995</ref> RFCs can be written by individuals or informal groups of individuals, but many are the product of a more formal Working Group. Drafts are submitted to the IESG either by individuals or by the Working Group Chair. An RFC Editor, appointed by the IAB, separate from IANA, and working in conjunction with the IESG, receives drafts from the IESG and edits, formats, and publishes them. Once an RFC is published, it is never revised. If the standard it describes changes or its information becomes obsolete, the revised standard or updated information will be re-published as a new RFC that \"obsoletes\" the original.<ref name=FYI17/><ref name=RFC4844/>\n\n===The Internet Society===\nThe [[Internet Society]] (ISOC) is an international, nonprofit organization founded during 1992 \"to assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world\". With offices near Washington, DC, USA, and in Geneva, Switzerland, ISOC has a membership base comprising more than 80 organizational and more than 50,000 individual members. Members also form \"chapters\" based on either common geographical location or special interests. There are currently more than 90 chapters around the world.<ref name=\"isoc.org\">[http://www.isoc.org/isoc/ Internet Society (ISOC) \u2013 Introduction to ISOC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nISOC provides financial and organizational support to and promotes the work of the standards settings bodies for which it is the organizational home: the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), the [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB), the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), and the [[Internet Research Task Force]] (IRTF).

The organizations which held control of certain technical aspects of the Internet were the successors of the old ARPANET oversight and the current decision-makers in the day-to-day technical aspects of the network. While recognized as the administrators of certain aspects of the Internet, their roles and their decision-making authority are limited and subject to increasing international scrutiny and increasing objections. These objections have led to the ICANN removing themselves from relationships with first the [[University of Southern California]] in 2000,<ref>[http://www.icann.org/en/general/usc-icann-transition-agreement.htm USC/ICANN Transition Agreement]</ref> and in September 2009, gaining autonomy from the US government by the ending of its longstanding agreements, although some contractual obligations with the U.S. Department of Commerce continued.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/icann-cuts-cord-to-us-government-gets-broader-oversight.ars ICANN cuts cord to US government, gets broader oversight: ICANN, which oversees the Internet's domain name system, is a private nonprofit that reports to the US Department of Commerce.

It predates the Internet, and was a crucial tool in creating it. Email started in 1965 as a way for multiple users of a [[time-sharing]] [[mainframe computer]] to communicate. Although the history is undocumented, among the first systems to have such a facility were the [[System Development Corporation]] (SDC) [[Q32]] and the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS) at MIT.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Risks Digest | work=Great moments in e-mail history | url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/20.25.html#subj3 | accessdate=April 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe ARPANET computer network made a large contribution to the evolution of electronic mail. An experimental inter-system transferred mail on the ARPANET shortly after its creation.<ref>{{cite web | title=The History of Electronic Mail | work=The History of Electronic Mail | url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html | accessdate=December 23, 2005}}</ref> In 1971 [[Ray Tomlinson]] created what was to become the standard Internet electronic mail addressing format, using the [[@|@ sign]] to separate mailbox names from host names.<ref>{{cite web | title=The First Network Email | work=The First Network Email | url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html | accessdate=December 23, 2005}}</ref>\n\nA number of protocols were developed to deliver messages among groups of time-sharing computers over alternative transmission systems, such as [[UUCP]] and [[IBM]]'s [[VNET]] email system. Email could be passed this way between a number of networks, including [[ARPANET]], [[BITNET]] and [[NSFNET]], as well as to hosts connected directly to other sites via UUCP. See the [[SMTP#History|history of SMTP]] protocol.\n\nIn addition, UUCP allowed the publication of text files that could be read by many others. The News software developed by Steve Daniel and [[Tom Truscott]] in 1979 was used to distribute news and bulletin board-like messages. This quickly grew into discussion groups, known as [[newsgroup]]s, on a wide range of topics. On ARPANET and NSFNET similar discussion groups would form via [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]], discussing both technical issues and more culturally focused topics (such as science fiction, discussed on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050828194633/http://www.sflovers.org/ sflovers] mailing list).\n\nDuring the early years of the Internet, email and similar mechanisms were also fundamental to allow people to access resources that were not available due to the absence of online connectivity. UUCP was often used to distribute files using the 'alt.binary' groups. Also, [[FTPmail|FTP e-mail gateways]] allowed people that lived outside the US and Europe to download files using ftp commands written inside email messages. The file was encoded, broken in pieces and sent by email; the receiver had to reassemble and decode it later, and it was the only way for people living overseas to download items such as the earlier Linux versions using the slow dial-up connections available at the time. After the popularization of the Web and the HTTP protocol such tools were slowly abandoned.\n\n===From Gopher to the WWW===\n{{Main|History of the World Wide Web|World Wide Web}}\nAs the Internet grew through the 1980s and early 1990s, many people realized the increasing need to be able to find and organize files and information. Projects such as [[Archie search engine|Archie]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], [[Wide area information server|WAIS]], and the FTP Archive list attempted to create ways to organize distributed data. In the early 1990s, Gopher, invented by [[Mark P. McCahill]] offered a viable alternative to the [[World Wide Web]]. However, in 1993 the World Wide Web saw many advances to indexing and ease of access through search engines, which often neglected Gopher and Gopherspace. As popularity increased through ease of use, investment incentives also grew until in the middle of 1994 the WWW's popularity gained the upper hand. Then it became clear that Gopher and the other projects were doomed fall short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm |title=Where Have all the Gophers Gone?

Gopher became the first commonly used hypertext interface to the Internet. While Gopher menu items were examples of hypertext, they were not commonly perceived in that way.\n\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\nIn 1989, while working at [[CERN]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented a network-based implementation of the hypertext concept.

The first of these was the [[Archie search engine]] from McGill University in 1990, followed in 1991 by [[Wide area information server|WAIS]] and Gopher. All three of those systems predated the invention of the World Wide Web but all continued to index the Web and the rest of the Internet for several years after the Web appeared. There are still Gopher servers as of 2006, although there are a great many more web servers.\n\nAs the Web grew, [[Web search engine|search engines]] and [[Web directory|Web directories]] were created to track pages on the Web and allow people to find things. The first full-text Web search engine was [[WebCrawler]] in 1994. Before WebCrawler, only Web page titles were searched. Another early search engine, [[Lycos]], was created in 1993 as a university project, and was the first to achieve commercial success. During the late 1990s, both Web directories and Web search engines were popular\u2014[[Yahoo!]] (founded 1994) and [[Altavista]] (founded 1995) were the respective industry leaders. By August 2001, the directory model had begun to give way to search engines, tracking the rise of [[Google]] (founded 1998), which had developed new approaches to [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevancy ranking]]. Directory features, while still commonly available, became after-thoughts to search engines.\n\nDatabase size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s, was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first. Relevancy ranking first became a major issue circa 1996, when it became apparent that it was impractical to review full lists of results. Consequently, [[algorithm]]s for relevancy ranking have continuously improved. Google's [[PageRank]] method for ordering the results has received the most press, but all major search engines continually refine their ranking methodologies with a view toward improving the ordering of results. As of 2006, search engine rankings are more important than ever, so much so that an industry has developed (\"[[search engine optimization|search engine optimizers]]\", or \"SEO\") to help web-developers improve their search ranking, and an entire body of [[case law]] has developed around matters that affect search engine rankings, such as use of [[trademarks]] in [[metatags]]. The sale of search rankings by some search engines has also created controversy among librarians and consumer advocates.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stross| first = Randall| title = Planet Google: One Company's Audacious Plan to Organize Everything We Know| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xOk3EIUW9VgC| accessdate = 9 December 2012| date = 22 September 2009| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 978-1-4165-4696-2 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 3, 2009, [[Microsoft]] launched its new search engine, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases |title=Microsoft's New Search at Bing.com Helps People Make Better Decisions: Decision Engine goes beyond search to help customers deal with information overload (Press Release) |publisher=Microsoft News Center |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120855/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press+Releases |archivedate=June 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The following month Microsoft and [[Yahoo!]] announced a deal in which Bing would power [[Yahoo!

The web was a new [[killer app]]\u2014it could bring together unrelated buyers and sellers in seamless and low-cost ways. Entrepreneurs around the world developed new business models, and ran to their nearest [[venture capitalist]]. While some of the new entrepreneurs had experience in business and economics, the majority were simply people with ideas, and did not manage the capital influx prudently. Additionally, many dot-com business plans were predicated on the assumption that by using the Internet, they would bypass the distribution channels of existing businesses and therefore not have to compete with them; when the established businesses with strong existing brands developed their own Internet presence, these hopes were shattered, and the newcomers were left attempting to break into markets dominated by larger, more established businesses. Many did not have the ability to do so.\n\nThe dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, with the technology heavy [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Composite]] index peaking at 5,048.62 on March 10<ref>[http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/historical/default.asp?detect=1&symbol=NASDAQ&close_date=3%2F10%2F00&x=34&y=12 Nasdaq peak of 5,048.62]</ref> (5,132.52 intraday), more than double its value just a year before. By 2001, the bubble's deflation was running full speed. A majority of the dot-coms had ceased trading, after having burnt through their [[venture capital]] and IPO capital, often without ever making a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. But despite this, the Internet continues to grow, driven by commerce, ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge and social networking.\n\n===Mobile phones and the Internet===\n{{See also|Mobile Web}}\nThe first mobile phone with Internet connectivity was the [[Nokia 9000 Communicator]], launched in Finland in 1996. The viability of Internet services access on mobile phones was limited until prices came down from that model, and network providers started to develop systems and services conveniently accessible on phones. [[NTT DoCoMo]] in Japan launched the first mobile Internet service, [[i-mode]], in 1999 and this is considered the birth of the mobile phone Internet services. In 2001, the mobile phone email system by Research in Motion (now [[BlackBerry Limited]]) for their [[BlackBerry]] product was launched in America. To make efficient use of the small screen and [[Telephone keypad|tiny keypad]] and one-handed operation typical of mobile phones, a specific document and networking model was created for mobile devices, the [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP). Most mobile device Internet services operate using WAP. The growth of mobile phone services was initially a primarily Asian phenomenon with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all soon finding the majority of their Internet users accessing resources by phone rather than by PC.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Developing countries followed, with India, South Africa, Kenya, the Philippines, and Pakistan all reporting that the majority of their domestic users accessed the Internet from a mobile phone rather than a PC. The European and North American use of the Internet was influenced by a large installed base of personal computers, and the growth of mobile phone Internet access was more gradual, but had reached national penetration levels of 20\u201330% in most Western countries.<ref name=\"DasguptaLall2001\">{{cite book| title = Policy Reform, Economic Growth, and the Digital Divide: An Econometric Analysis| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4v-04WJ4UBEC| accessdate = 11 February 2013| year = 2001| publisher = World Bank Publications| id = GGKEY:YLS5GEUEBAR| pages = 1\u20133| author1 = Susmita Dasgupta| author2 = Somik V.

The rhetorician [[Quintilian]] regarded his ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: \"He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words.\"<ref group=\"nb\">Quintilian 10.1.96. The only other lyrical poet Quintilian thought comparable with Horace was the now obscure poet/metrical theorist, [[Caesius Bassus]] (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient Receptions of Horace'', 280)</ref>\n\nHorace also crafted elegant [[Prosody (Latin)|hexameter verses]] (''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires]]'' and ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]'') and caustic [[Iambus (genre)|iambic poetry]] (''[[Epodes]]''). The hexameters are amusing yet serious works, friendly in tone, leading the ancient satirist [[Persius]] to comment: \"as his friend laughs, Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in, he plays about the heartstrings\".<ref group=\"nb\">Translated from Persius' own 'Satires' 1.116\u201317: \"omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico / tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit.\"</ref>\n\nHis career coincided with Rome's momentous change from a [[republic]] to an [[empire]]. An officer in the republican army defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, he was befriended by Octavian's right-hand man in civil affairs, [[Maecenas]],  and became a spokesman for the new regime. For some commentators, his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was \"a master of the graceful sidestep\")<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">J. Michie, ''The Odes of Horace'', 14</ref> but for others he was, in [[John Dryden]]'s phrase, \"a well-mannered court slave\".<ref>N.

Various Italic dialects were spoken in the area and this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been familiar with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring [[Canusium]].<ref>''Satires'' 1.10.30</ref> One of the works he probably studied in school was the ''Odyssia'' of [[Livius Andronicus]], taught by teachers like the '[[Orbilius]]' mentioned in one of his poems.<ref>''Epistles'' 2.1.69 ff.</ref> Army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)]].<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 2\u20133</ref> Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace,<ref>''Satires'' 2.1.34</ref> a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the [[Samnites]] had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman<ref>T. Frank, ''Catullus and Horace'', 133\u201334</ref><ref>A. Campbell, ''Horace: A New Interpretation'', 84</ref> though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or [[Sabellus]] by birth.<ref>''Epistles'' 1.16.49</ref><ref>R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 7</ref> Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 3\u20134</ref>\n\nHorace's father was probably a Venutian taken captive by Romans in the Social War, or possibly he was descended from a [[Sabine]] captured in the [[Samnite Wars]]. Either way, he was a slave for at least part of his life. He was evidently a man of strong abilities however and managed to gain his freedom and improve his social position. Thus Horace claimed to be the free-born son of a prosperous 'coactor'.<ref name=\"Kiernan\">V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 24</ref> The term 'coactor' could denote various roles, such as tax collector, but its use by Horace<ref>''Satires'' 1.6.86</ref> was explained by [[scholia]] as a reference to 'coactor argentareus' i.e. an auctioneer with some of the functions of a banker, paying the seller out of his own funds and later recovering the sum with interest from the buyer.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 4\u20135</ref>\n\nThe father spent a small fortune on his son's education, eventually accompanying him to [[Rome]] to oversee his schooling and moral development. The poet later paid tribute to him in a poem<ref name=\"Satires 1.6\">''Satires'' 1.6</ref> that one modern scholar considers the best memorial by any son to his father.<ref group=\"nb\">\"No son ever set a finer monument to his father than Horace did in the sixth satire of Book I...Horace's description of his father is warm-hearted but free from sentimentality or exaggeration. We see before us one of the common people, a hard-working, open-minded, and thoroughly honest man of simple habits and strict convictions, representing some of the best qualities that at the end of the Republic could still be found in the unsophisticated society of the Italian ''municipia''\"{{emdash}}E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 5\u20136</ref> The poem includes this passage:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf my character is flawed by a few minor faults, but is otherwise decent and moral, if you can point out only a few scattered blemishes on an otherwise immaculate surface, if no one can accuse me of greed, or of prurience, or of profligacy, if I live a virtuous life, free of defilement (pardon, for a moment, my self-praise), and if I am to my friends a good friend, my father deserves all the credit... As it is now, he deserves from me unstinting gratitude and praise. I could never be ashamed of such a father, nor do I feel any need, as many people do, to apologize for being a freedman's son. ''[[Satire]]s 1.6.65\u201392''\n</blockquote>\n\nHe never mentioned his mother in his verses and he might not have known much about her. Perhaps she also had been a slave.<ref name=\"Kiernan\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nHorace left Rome, possibly after his father's death, and continued his formal education in Athens, a great centre of learning in the ancient world, where he arrived at nineteen years of age, enrolling in [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]]. Founded by [[Plato]], The Academy was now dominated by [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], whose theories and practises made a deep impression on the young man from Venusia.<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 25</ref> Meanwhile, he mixed and lounged about with the elite of Roman youth, such as Marcus, the idle son of [[Cicero]], and the Pompeius to whom he later addressed a poem.<ref>''Odes'' 2.7</ref> It was in Athens too that he probably acquired deep familiarity with the ancient tradition of Greek lyric poetry, at that time largely the preserve of grammarians and academic specialists (access to such material was easier in Athens than in Rome, where the public libraries had yet to be built by [[Asinius Pollio]] and Augustus).<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 8\u20139</ref>\n\nRome's troubles following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] were soon to catch up with him. [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] came to Athens seeking support for the republican cause. Brutus was f\u00eated around town in grand receptions and he made a point of attending academic lectures, all the while recruiting supporters among the young men studying there, including Horace.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 9\u201310</ref> An educated young Roman could begin military service high in the ranks and Horace was made [[tribunus militum]] (one of six senior officers of a typical legion), a post usually reserved for men of  senatorial or equestrian rank and which seems to have inspired jealousy among his well-born confederates.<ref>''Satires'' 1.6.48</ref><ref name=\"Nisbet\">R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 8</ref> He learned the basics of military life while on the march, particularly in the wilds of northern Greece, whose rugged scenery became a backdrop to some of his later poems.<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace'', 25</ref> It was there in 42 BC that [[Octavian]] (later [[Augustus]]) and his associate [[Mark Antony]] crushed the republican forces at the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Horace later recorded it as a day of embarrassment for himself, when he fled without his shield,<ref>''Odes'' 2.7.10</ref> but allowance should be made for his self-deprecating humour. Moreover, the incident allowed him to identify himself with some famous poets who had long ago abandoned their shields in battle, notably his heroes [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Archilochus]]. The comparison with the latter poet is uncanny: Archilochus lost his shield in a part of Thrace near Philippi, and he was deeply involved in the Greek colonization of [[Thasos]], where Horace's die-hard comrades finally surrendered.<ref name=\"Nisbet\"/>\n\nOctavian offered an early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly accepted it. On returning to Italy, he was confronted with yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia was one of many throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans ([[Virgil]] lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry.<ref>''Epistles'' 2.2.51\u20132</ref> In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich.<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and politics''</ref> Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of ''scriba quaestorius'', a civil service position at the ''aerarium'' or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ''ordo equester'' and not very demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to ''scribae'' or permanent clerks.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 14\u201315</ref> It was about this time that he began writing his ''Satires'' and ''Epodes''.\n\n====Poet====\n[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|thumb|Horace reads before Maecenas, by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]\n\nThe ''Epodes'' belong to [[iambic poetry]]. Iambic poetry features insulting and obscene language<ref>Christopher Brown, in ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', D.E.Gerber (ed), Leiden 1997, pages 13\u201388</ref><ref>Douglas E. Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), Introduction pages i\u2013iv</ref>; sometimes, it is referred to as ''blame poetry''.<ref>D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'',C.U.P., 8</ref> ''Blame poetry'', or ''shame poetry'', is poetry written to blame and shame fellow citizens into a sense of their social obligations. Horace modelled these poems on the poetry of [[Archilochus]]. Social bonds in Rome had been decaying since the destruction of [[Carthage]] a little more than a hundred years earlier, due to the vast wealth that could be gained by plunder and corruption.<ref>D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 6</ref> These social ills were magnified by rivalry between Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and confederates like [[Sextus Pompey]], all jockeying for a bigger share of the spoils. One modern scholar has counted a dozen civil wars in the hundred years leading up to 31 BC, including the [[Spartacus]] rebellion, eight years before Horace's birth.<ref>R. Conway, ''New Studies of a Great Inheritance'', 49\u201350</ref> As the heirs to Hellenistic culture, Horace and his fellow Romans were not well prepared to deal with these problems:\n\n{{Quotation|\"At bottom, all the problems that the times were stirring up were of a social nature, which the Hellenistic thinkers were ill qualified to grapple with. Some of them censured oppression of the poor by the rich, but they gave no practical lead, though they may have hoped to see well-meaning rulers doing so. Philosophy was drifting into absorption in self, a quest for private contentedness, to be achieved by self-control and restraint, without much regard for the fate of a disintegrating community.\"{{emdash}}V.G. Kiernan<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 18\u201319</ref>}}\nHorace's Hellenistic background is clear in his Satires, even though the genre was unique to Latin literature. He brought to it a style and outlook suited to the social and ethical issues confronting Rome but he changed its role from public, social engagement to private meditation.<ref>F. Muecke, ''The Satires'', 109\u201310</ref> Meanwhile, he was beginning to interest Octavian's supporters, a gradual process described by him in one of his satires.<ref name=\"Satires 1.6\"/> The way was opened for him by his friend, the poet Virgil, who had gained admission into the privileged circle around Maecenas, Octavian's lieutenant, following the success of his  ''[[Eclogues]]''. An introduction soon followed and, after a discreet interval, Horace too was accepted. He depicted the process as an honourable one, based on merit and mutual respect, eventually leading to true friendship, and there is reason to believe that his relationship was genuinely friendly, not just with Maecenas but afterwards with Augustus as well.<ref>R. Lyne, ''Augustan Poetry and Society'', 599</ref> On the other hand, the poet has been unsympathetically described by one scholar as \"a sharp and rising young man, with an eye to the main chance.\"<ref>J. Griffin, ''Horace in the Thirties'', 6</ref> There were advantages on both sides: Horace gained encouragement and material support, the politicians gained a hold on a potential dissident.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10</ref> His republican sympathies, and his role at Philippi, may have caused him some pangs of remorse over his new status. However most Romans considered the civil wars to be the result of ''contentio dignitatis'', or rivalry between the foremost families of the city, and he too seems to have accepted the principate as Rome's last hope for much needed peace.<ref>D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 5</ref>\n\nIn 37 BC, Horace accompanied Maecenas on a journey to [[Brundisium]], described in one of his poems<ref>''Satires'' 1.5</ref> as a series of amusing incidents and charming encounters with other friends along the way, such as Virgil. In fact the journey was political in its motivation, with Maecenas en route to negotiatie the [[Treaty of Tarentum]] with Antony, a fact Horace artfully keeps from the reader (political issues are largely avoided in the first book of satires).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Horace was probably also with Maecenas on one of Octavian's naval expeditions against the piratical Sextus Pompeius, which ended in a disastrous storm off [[Palinurus]] in 36 BC, briefly alluded to by Horace in terms of near-drowning.<ref>''Odes'' 3.4.28</ref><ref group=\"nb\">''Odes'' 3.4.28: \"nec (me extinxit) Sicula Palinurus unda\"; \"nor did Palinurus extinguish me with Sicilian waters\". Maecenas' involvement is recorded by [[Appian]] ''Bell. Civ.'' 5.99 but Horace's ode is the only historical reference to his own presence there, depending however on interpretation. (R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10)</ref> There are also some indications in his verses that he was with Maecenas at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, where Octavian defeated his great rival, Antony.<ref>''Epodes'' 1 and 9</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The point is much disputed among scholars and hinges on how the text is interpreted. ''Epodes'' 9 for example may offer proof of Horace's presence if 'ad hunc frementis' ('gnashing at this' man i.e. the traitrous Roman ) is a misreading of 'at huc...verterent' (but hither...they fled) in lines describing the defection of the Galatian cavalry, \"ad hunc frementis verterunt bis mille equos / Galli canentes Caesarem\" (R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 12).</ref> By then Horace had already received from Maecenas the famous gift of his [[Horace's villa|Sabine farm]], probably not long after the publication of the first book of ''Satires''. The gift, which included income from five tenants, may have ended his career at the Treasury, or at least allowed him to give it less time and energy.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 15</ref> It signalled his identification with the Octavian regime yet, in the second book of ''Satires'' that soon followed, he continued the apolitical stance of the first book. By this time, he had attained the status of ''eques Romanus'',<ref>''Satires'' 2.7.53</ref> perhaps as a result of his work at the Treasury.<ref>R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 11</ref>\n\n====Knight====\n\n''Odes'' 1\u20133 were the next focus for his artistic creativity. He adapted their forms and themes from Greek lyric poetry of the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The fragmented nature of the [[Greek world]] had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to [[Horace's Villa|his own estate]] in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 61\u20132</ref> yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Nevertheless, his work in the period 30\u201327 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology. In ''Odes'' 1.2, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry. The name ''Augustus'', which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in ''Odes'' 3.3 and 3.5. In the period 27\u201324 BC, political allusions in the ''Odes'' concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1.35), Arabia (1.29) Spain (3.8) and Parthia (2.2). He greeted Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3.14).<ref>R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 13</ref>\n\nThe public reception of ''Odes'' 1\u20133 disappointed him however. He attributed the lack of success to jealousy among imperial courtiers and to his isolation from literary cliques.<ref>''Epistles'' 1.19.35\u201344</ref> Perhaps it was disappointment that led him to put aside the genre in favour of verse letters. He addressed his first book of ''Epistles'' to a variety of friends and acquaintances in an urbane style reflecting his new social status as a knight. In the opening poem, he professed a deeper interest in moral philosophy than poetry<ref>''Epistles'' 1.1.10</ref> but, though the collection demonstrates a leaning towards stoic theory, it reveals no sustained thinking about ethics.<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 149, 153</ref> Maecenas was still the dominant confidante but Horace had now begun to assert his own independence, suavely declining constant invitations to attend his patron.<ref>''Epistles'' 1.7</ref> In the final poem of the first book of ''Epistles'', he revealed himself to be forty-four years old in the consulship of Lollius and Lepidus i.e. 21 BC, and \"of small stature, fond of the sun, prematurely grey, quick-tempered but easily placated\".<ref>''Epistles'' 1.20.24\u20135</ref><ref>R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 14\u201315</ref>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the second book of ''Epistles'' was  prompted by Augustus, who desired a verse epistle to be addressed to himself. Augustus was in fact a prolific letter-writer and he once asked Horace to be his personal secretary. Horace refused the secretarial role but complied with the emperor's request for a verse letter.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 17\u201318</ref> The letter to Augustus may have been slow in coming, being published possibly as late as 11 BC. It celebrated, among other things, the 15 BC military victories of his stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius, yet it and the following letter<ref>''Epistles'' 2.2</ref> were largely devoted to literary theory and criticism. The literary theme was explored still further in ''Ars Poetica'', published separately but written in the form of an epistle and sometimes referred to as ''Epistles'' 2.3 (possibly the last poem he ever wrote).<ref>R. Ferri, ''The Epistles'', 121</ref> He was also commissioned to write odes commemorating the victories of Drusus and Tiberius<ref>''Odes'' 4.4 and 4.14</ref> and one to be sung in a temple of Apollo for the [[Secular Games]], a long abandoned festival that Augustus revived in accordance with his policy of recreating ancient customs (''Carmen Saeculare'').\n\nSuetonius recorded some gossip about Horace's sexual activities late in life, claiming that the walls of his bedchamber were covered with obscene pictures and mirrors, so that he saw erotica wherever he looked.<ref group=\"nb\">Suetonius signals that the report is based on rumours by employing the terms \"traditur...dicitur\" / \"it is reported...it is said\"  (E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 21)</ref> The poet died at 56 years of age, not long after his friend Maecenas, near whose tomb he was laid to rest.

There are persuasive arguments for the following chronology:<ref>R Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 17\u201321</ref>\n* ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires 1]]'' (c. 35\u201334 BC)\n* ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires 2]]'' (c. 30 BC)\n* ''[[Epodes]]'' (30 BC)\n* ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes 1\u20133]]'' (c. 23 BC)<ref group=\"nb\">According to a recent theory, the three books of ''Odes'' were issued separately, possibly in 26, 24 and 23 BC (see G. Hutchinson (2002), ''Classical Quarterly'' 52: 517\u201337)</ref>\n* ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles 1]]'' (c. 21 BC)\n* ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' (17 BC)\n* ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles 2]]'' (c. 11 BC)<ref group=\"nb\">19 BC is the usual estimate but c. 11 BC has good support too (see R.

Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'', 379\u201381</ref>\n\n===Historical context===\nHorace composed in traditional [[Meter (poetry)|metres]] borrowed from [[Archaic Greece]], employing [[hexameter]]s in his ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', and [[iamb (poetry)|iambs]] in his ''Epodes'', all of which were relatively easy to adapt into [[Prosody (Latin)|Latin forms]]. His ''Odes'' featured more complex measures, including [[Alcaic verse|alcaics]] and [[Sapphic stanza|sapphics]], which were sometimes a difficult fit for Latin structure and [[syntax]]. Despite these traditional metres, he presented himself as a partisan in the development of a new and sophisticated style. He was influenced in particular by [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic]] aesthetics of brevity, elegance and polish, as modeled in the work of [[Callimachus]].<ref>S. Harrison, ''Style and poetic texture'', 262</ref>\n{{Quotation|\"As soon as Horace, stirred by his own genius and encouraged by the example of Virgil, Varius, and perhaps some other poets of the same generation, had determined to make his fame as a poet, being by temperament a fighter, he wanted to fight against all kinds of prejudice, amateurish slovenliness, philistinism, reactionary tendencies, in short to fight for the new and noble type of poetry which he and his friends were endeavouring to bring about.\"{{emdash}}Eduard Fraenkel<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 124\u20135</ref>}}\n\nIn modern literary theory, a distinction is often made between immediate personal experience (''Urerlebnis'') and experience mediated by cultural vectors such as literature, philosophy and the visual arts (''Bildungserlebnis'').<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gundolf|first1=Friedrich|title=Goethe|date=1916|publisher=Bondi|location=Berlin, Germany}}</ref> The distinction has little relevance for Horace{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} however since his personal and literary experiences are implicated in each other. ''Satires'' 1.5, for example, recounts in detail a real trip Horace made with Virgil and some of his other literary friends, and which parallels a Satire by [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], his predecessor.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 106\u20137</ref> Unlike much Hellenistic-inspired literature, however, his poetry was not composed for a small coterie of admirers and fellow poets, nor does it rely on abstruse allusions for many of its effects. Though elitist in its literary standards, it was written for a wide audience, as a public form of art.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 74</ref> Ambivalence also characterizes his literary persona, since his presentation of himself as part of a small community of philosophically aware people, seeking true peace of mind while shunning vices like greed, was well adapted to Augustus's plans to reform public morality, corrupted by greed{{spaced ndash}}his personal plea for moderation was part of the emperor's grand message to the nation.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 95\u20136</ref>\n\nHorace generally followed the examples of poets established as classics in different genres, such as [[Archilochus]] in the ''Epodes'', Lucilius in the ''Satires'' and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] in the ''Odes'', later broadening his scope for the sake of variation and because his models weren't actually suited to the realities confronting him. Archilochus and Alcaeus were aristocratic Greeks whose poetry had a social and religious function that was immediately intelligible to their audiences but which became a mere artifice or literary motif when transposed to Rome. However, the artifice of the ''Odes'' is also integral to their success, since they could now accommodate a wide range of emotional effects, and the blend of Greek and Roman elements adds a sense of detachment and universality.<ref>J. Griffin, ''Gods and Religion'', 182</ref> Horace proudly claimed to introduce into Latin the spirit and iambic poetry of Archilochus but (unlike Archilochus) without persecuting anyone (''Epistles'' 1.19.23\u20135). It was no idle boast. His ''Epodes'' were modeled on the verses of the Greek poet, as 'blame poetry', yet he avoided targeting real [[scapegoat]]s. Whereas Archilochus presented himself as a serious and vigorous opponent of wrong-doers, Horace aimed for comic effects and adopted the persona of a weak and ineffectual critic of his times (as symbolized for example in his surrender to the witch Canidia in the final epode).<ref>S. Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 192</ref> He also claimed to be the first to introduce into Latin the lyrical methods of Alcaeus (''Epistles'' 1.19.32\u20133) and he actually was the first Latin poet to make consistent use of Alcaic meters and themes: love, politics and the [[symposium]]. He imitated other Greek lyric poets as well, employing a 'motto' technique, beginning each ode with some reference to a Greek original and then diverging from it.<ref>S. Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 194\u20136</ref>\n\nThe satirical poet Lucilius was a senator's son who could castigate his peers with impunity. Horace was a mere freedman's son who had to tread carefully.<ref name=\"E. Fraenkel, Horace, 32, 80\">E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 32, 80</ref> Lucilius was a rugged patriot and a significant voice in Roman self-awareness, endearing himself to his countrymen by his blunt frankness and explicit politics. His work expressed genuine freedom or [[libertas]]. His style included  'metrical vandalism'  and looseness of structure. Horace instead adopted an oblique and ironic style of satire, ridiculing stock characters and anonymous targets. His libertas was the private freedom of a philosophical outlook, not a political or social privilege.<ref>L. Morgan, ''Satire'', 177\u20138</ref> His ''Satires'' are relatively easy-going in their use of meter (relative to the tight lyric meters of the ''Odes'')<ref>S. Harrison, ''Style and poetic texture'', 271</ref> but formal and highly controlled relative to the poems of Lucilius, whom Horace mocked for his sloppy standards (''Satires'' 1.10.56\u201361)<ref group=\"nb\">\"[Lucilius]...resembles a man whose only concern is to force / something into the framework of six feet, and who gaily produces / two hundred lines before dinner and another two hundred after.\"{{spaced ndash}}''Satire'' 1.10.59\u201361 (translated by [[Niall Rudd]], ''The Satires of Horace and Persius'', Penguin Classics 1973, p 69)</ref>\n\nThe ''Epistles'' may be considered among Horace's most innovative works. There was nothing like it in Greek or Roman literature. Occasionally  poems had had some resemblance to letters, including an elegiac poem from [[Solon]] to [[Mimnermus]] and some lyrical poems from [[Pindar]] to [[Hieron of Syracuse]]. Lucilius had composed a satire in the form of a letter, and some epistolary poems were composed by [[Catullus]] and [[Propertius]]. But nobody before Horace had ever composed an entire collection of verse letters,<ref>R. Ferri, ''The Epistles'', p.121-22</ref> let alone letters with a focus on philosophical problems. The sophisticated and flexible style that he had developed in his ''Satires'' was adapted to the more serious needs of this new genre.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', p. 309</ref> Such refinement of style was not unusual for Horace. His craftsmanship as a wordsmith is apparent even in his earliest attempts at this or that kind of poetry, but his handling of each genre tended to improve over time as he adapted it to his own needs.<ref name=\"E. Fraenkel, Horace, 32, 80\"/> Thus for example it is generally agreed that his second book of ''Satires'', where human folly is revealed through dialogue between characters, is superior to the first, where he propounds his ethics in monologues. Nevertheless, the first book includes some of his most popular poems.<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 28</ref>\n\n===Themes===\nHorace developed a number of inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself. His ''Epodes'' and ''Satires'' are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]]. This often takes the form of allusions to the work and philosophy of [[Bion of Borysthenes]] <ref group=\"nb\">There is one reference to Bion by name in ''Epistles'' 2.2.60, and the clearest allusion to him is in ''Satire'' 1.6, which parallels Bion fragments 1, 2, 16 ''Kindstrand''</ref> but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment. By the time he composed his ''Epistles'', he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and \"high-falutin\" philosophy in general.<ref group=\"nb\">''Epistles'' 1.17 and 1.18.6\u20138 are critical of the extreme views of [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and also of social adaptations of Cynic precepts, and yet ''Epistle'' 1.2 could be either Cynic or Stoic in its orientation (J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 177</ref><ref>J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 165-69, 177</ref> The ''Satires'' also include a strong element of [[Epicureanism]], with frequent allusions to the Epicurean poet [[Lucretius]].<ref group=\"nb\">''Satires'' 1.1.25\u201326, 74\u20135, 1.2.111\u201312, 1.3.76\u20137, 97\u2013114, 1.5.44, 101\u20133, 1.6.128\u201331, 2.2.14\u201320, 25, 2.6.93\u20137</ref> So for example the Epicurean sentiment ''[[carpe diem]]'' is the inspiration behind Horace's repeated punning on his own name (''Horatius ~ hora'') in ''Satires'' 2.6.<ref>K. J. Reckford, ''Some studies in Horace's odes on love''</ref> The ''Satires'' also feature some [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] and [[Platonic Dialogues|Platonic]] (''Dialogues'') elements. In short, the ''Satires'' present a medley of philosophical programs, dished up in no particular order{{spaced ndash}}a style of argument typical of the [[Satires (Horace)|genre]].<ref>J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 168</ref> The ''Odes'' display a wide range of topics. Over time, he becomes more confident about his political voice.<ref>Santirocco \"Unity and Design\", Lowrie \"Horace's Narrative Odes\"</ref> Although he is often thought of as an overly intellectual lover, he is ingenuous in representing passion.<ref>Ancona, \"Time and the Erotic\"</ref> The \"Odes\" weave various philosophical strands together, with allusions and statements of doctrine present in about a third of the ''Odes'' Books 1\u20133, ranging from the flippant (1.22, 3.28) to the solemn (2.10, 3.2, 3.3). Epicureanism is the dominant influence, characterizing about twice as many of these odes as Stoicism. A group of odes combines these two influences in tense relationships, such as ''Odes'' 1.7, praising Stoic virility and devotion to public duty while also advocating private pleasures among friends. While generally favouring the Epicurean lifestyle, the lyric poet is as eclectic as the satiric poet, and in ''Odes'' 2.10 even proposes Aristotle's [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] as a remedy for Rome's political troubles.<ref>J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 171-73</ref> Many of Horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry.<ref>Davis \"Polyhymnia\" and Lowrie \"Horace's Narrative Odes\"</ref> ''Odes'' 4, thought to be composed at the emperor's request, takes the themes of the first three books of \"Odes\" to a new level. This book shows greater poetic confidence after the public performance of his \"Carmen saeculare\" or \"Century hymn\" at a public festival orchestrated by Augustus. In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises. It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living. In that ode, the epic poet and the lyric poet are aligned with Stoicism and Epicureanism respectively, in a mood of bitter-sweet pathos.<ref>J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 179</ref> The first poem of the ''Epistles'' sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: \"So now I put aside both verses and all those other games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern.\" His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous. Ambiguity is the hallmark of the ''Epistles''. It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized. Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste. Thus he depicts the ups and downs of the philosophical life more realistically than do most philosophers.<ref>J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 174-80</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Quinto Orazio Flacco.jpg|thumb|Horace, portrayed by [[Giacomo Di Chirico]]]]\n\nThe reception of Horace's work has varied from one epoch to another and varied markedly even in his own lifetime. ''Odes'' 1\u20133 were not well received when first 'published' in Rome, yet Augustus later commissioned a ceremonial ode for the Centennial Games in 17 BC and also encouraged the publication of ''Odes'' 4, after which Horace's reputation as Rome's premier lyricist was assured. His Odes were to become the best received of all his poems in ancient times, acquiring a classic status that discouraged imitation: no other poet produced a comparable body of lyrics in the four centuries that followed<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 279</ref> (though that might also be attributed to social causes, particularly the parasitism that Italy was sinking into).<ref>V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 176</ref> In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ode-writing became highly fashionable in England and a large number of aspiring poets imitated Horace both in English and in Latin.<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 326, 332</ref>\n\nIn a verse epistle to Augustus (Epistle 2.1), in 12 BC, Horace argued for classic status to be awarded to contemporary poets, including Virgil and apparently himself.<ref>R. Lyme, ''Augustan Poetry and Society'', 603</ref> In the final poem of his third book of Odes he claimed to have created for himself a monument more durable than bronze (\"Exegi monumentum aere perennius\", ''[[Carmina]]'' 3.30.1). For one modern scholar, however, Horace's personal qualities are more notable than the monumental quality of his achievement:\n{{quote|\"...when we hear his name we don't really think of a monument. We think rather of a voice which varies in tone and resonance but is always recognizable, and which by its unsentimental humanity evokes a very special blend of liking and respect.{{emdash}}[[Niall Rudd]]<ref>[[Niall Rudd]], ''The Satires of Horace and Persius'', 14</ref>}}\nYet for men like [[Wilfred Owen]], scarred by experiences of World War I, his poetry stood for discredited values:\n{{quote|My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br>The Old Lie: Dulce et decorum est<br>Pro patria mori.<ref group=\"nb\">Wilfred Owen, ''[[Dulce et decorum est]]'' (1917), echoes a line from ''Carmina'' 3.2.13, \"it is sweet and honourable to die for one's country\", cited by Stephen Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 340.</ref>}}\nThe same motto, [[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], had been adapted to the ethos of martyrdom in the lyrics of early Christian poets like [[Prudentius]].<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282\u20133</ref>\n\nThese preliminary comments touch on a small sample of developments in the reception of Horace's work. More developments are covered epoch by epoch in the following sections.\n\n===Antiquity===\nHorace's influence can be observed in the work of his near contemporaries, [[Ovid]] and [[Propertius]]. Ovid followed his example in creating a completely natural style of expression in hexameter verse, and Propertius cheekily mimicked him in his third book of elegies.<ref group=\"nb\">Propertius published his third book of elegies within a year or two of Horace's Odes 1\u20133 and mimicked him, for example, in the opening lines, characterizing himself in terms borrowed from Odes 3.1.13 and 3.30.13\u201314, as a priest of the Muses and as an adaptor of Greek forms of poetry (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 227)</ref> His ''Epistles'' provided them both with a model for their own verse letters and it also shaped Ovid's exile poetry.<ref group=\"nb\">Ovid for example probably borrowed from Horace's ''Epistle'' 1.20 the image of a poetry book as a slave boy eager to leave home, adapting it to the opening poems of ''Tristia'' 1 and 3 (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace''), and ''Tristia'' 2 may be understood as a counterpart to Horace's ''Epistles'' 2.1, both being letters addressed to Augustus on literary themes (A. Barchiesi, ''Speaking Volumes'', 79\u2013103)</ref>\n\nHis influence had a perverse aspect. As mentioned before, the brilliance of his ''Odes'' may have discouraged imitation. Conversely, they may have created a vogue for the lyrics of the archaic Greek poet [[Pindar]], due to the fact that Horace had neglected that style of lyric (see [[Pindar#Influence and legacy]]).<ref>R. Tarrant, Ancient receptions of Horace, 280</ref> The iambic genre seems almost to have disappeared after publication of Horace's ''Epodes''. Ovid's ''Ibis'' was a rare attempt at the form but it was inspired mainly by [[Callimachus]], and there are some iambic elements in [[Martial]] but the main influence there was [[Catullus]].<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 278</ref> A revival of popular interest in the satires of Lucilius may have been inspired by Horace's criticism of his unpolished style. Both Horace and Lucilius were considered good role-models by [[Persius]], who critiqued his own satires as lacking both the acerbity of Lucillius and the gentler touch of Horace.<ref group=\"nb\">The comment is in Persius 1.114\u201318, yet that same satire has been found to have nearly 80 reminiscences of Horace; see D. Hooley, ''The Knotted Thong'', 29</ref> [[Juvenal]]'s caustic satire was influenced mainly by Lucilius but Horace by then was a school classic and Juvenal could refer to him respectfully and in a round-about way as \"''the Venusine lamp''\".<ref group=\"nb\">The allusion to ''Venusine'' comes via Horace's ''Sermones'' 2.1.35, while ''lamp'' signifies the lucubrations of a conscientious poet. According to Quintilian (93), however, many people in Flavian Rome preferred Lucilius not only to Horace but to all other Latin poets (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 279)</ref>\n\n[[Statius]] paid homage to Horace by composing one poem in Sapphic and one in Alcaic meter (the verse forms most often associated with ''Odes''), which he included in his collection of occasional poems, ''Silvae''. Ancient scholars wrote commentaries on the lyric meters of the ''Odes'', including the scholarly poet [[Caesius Bassus]]. By a process called ''derivatio'', he varied established meters through the addition or omission of syllables, a technique borrowed by [[Seneca the Younger]] when adapting Horatian meters to the stage.<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 280\u201381</ref>\n\nHorace's poems continued to be school texts into late antiquity. Works attributed to [[Helenius Acro]] and [[Pomponius Porphyrio]] are the remnants of a much larger body of Horatian scholarship. Porphyrio arranged the poems in non-chronological order, beginning with the ''Odes'', because of their general popularity and their appeal to scholars (the ''Odes'' were to retain this privileged position in the medieval manuscript tradition and thus in modern editions also). Horace was often evoked by poets of the fourth century, such as [[Ausonius]] and [[Claudian]]. [[Prudentius]] presented himself as a Christian Horace, adapting Horatian meters to his own poetry and giving Horatian motifs a Christian tone.<ref group=\"nb\">Prudentius sometimes alludesto the ''Odes'' in a negative context, as expressions of a secular life he is abandoning. Thus for example ''male pertinax'', employed in Prudentius's ''Praefatio'' to describe a wilful desire for victory, is lifted from ''Odes'' 1.9.24, where it describes a girl's half-hearted resistance to seduction. Elsewhere he borrows ''dux bone'' from ''Odes'' 4.5.5 and 37, where it refers to Augustus, and applies it to Christ (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282</ref> On the other hand, [[St Jerome]], modelled an uncompromising response to the pagan Horace, observing: \"''What harmony can there be between Christ and the Devil? What has Horace to do with the Psalter?''\"<ref group=\"nb\">St Jerome, ''Epistles'' 22.29, incorporating a quote from ''2 'Corinthians'' 6.14: ''qui consensus Christo et Belial? quid facit cum psalterio Horatius?''(cited by K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 292)</ref> By the early sixth century, Horace and Prudentius were both part of a classical heritage that was struggling to survive the disorder of the times. [[Boethius]], the last major author of classical Latin literature, could still take inspiration from Horace, sometimes mediated by Senecan tragedy.<ref name=\"Tarrant\">R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 283</ref> It can be argued that Horace's influence extended beyond poetry to dignify core themes and values of the early Christian era, such as self-sufficiency, inner contentment and courage.<ref group=\"nb\">''Odes'' 3.3.1\u20138 was especially influential in promoting the value of heroic calm in the face of danger, describing a man who could bear even the collapse of the world without fear (''si fractus illabatur orbis,/impavidum ferient ruinae''). Echoes are found in Seneca's ''Agamemnon'' 593\u2013603, Prudentius's ''Peristephanon'' 4.5\u201312 and Boethius's ''Consolatio'' 1 metrum 4.(R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 283\u201385)</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\n[[File:Horaz beim Studium.jpg|thumb|Horace in his Studium: German print of the fifteenth century, summarizing the final [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XV|ode 4.15]] (in praise of Augustus).]]\n\nClassical texts almost ceased being copied in the period between the mid sixth century and the [[Carolingian Renaissance | Carolingian revival]]. Horace's work probably survived in just two or three books imported into northern Europe from Italy. These became the ancestors of six extant manuscripts dated to the ninth century. Two of those six manuscripts are French in origin, one was produced in [[Alsace]], and the other three show Irish influence but were probably written in continental monasteries ([[Lombardy]] for example).<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 285\u201387</ref> By the last half of the ninth century, it was not uncommon for literate people to have direct experience of Horace's poetry. His influence on the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] can be found in the poems of [[Heiric of Auxerre]]<ref group=\"nb\">Heiric, like Prudentius, gave Horatian motifs a Christian context. Thus the character Lydia in ''Odes'' 3.19.15, who would willingly die for her lover twice, becomes in Heiric's ''Life'' of St Germaine of Auxerre a saint ready to die twice for the Lord's commandments (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 287\u201388)</ref> and in some manuscripts marked with [[neumes]], mysterious notations that may have been an aid to the memorization and discussion of his lyric meters. ''Ode'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|4.11]] is neumed with the melody of a hymn to John the Baptist, ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', composed in [[Sapphic stanza]]s. This hymn later became the basis of the [[solfege]] system (''Do, re, mi...''){{emdash}}an association with western music quite appropriate for a lyric poet like Horace, though the language of the hymn is mainly Prudentian.<ref>R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 288\u201389</ref> Lyons<ref>Stuart Lyons, Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi</ref> argues that the melody in question was linked with Horace's Ode well before Guido d'Arezzo fitted [[Ut queant laxis]] to it.  However, the melody is unlikely to be a survivor from classical times, although Ovid<ref>Tristia, 4.10.49\u201350</ref> testifies to Horace's use of the lyre while performing his Odes.\n\nThe German scholar, [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]], once dubbed the tenth and eleventh centuries ''The age of Horace'' (''aetas Horatiana''), and placed it between the ''aetas Vergiliana'' of the eighth and ninth centuries, and the ''aetas Ovidiana'' of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a distinction supposed to reflect the dominant classical Latin influences of those times. Such a distinction is over-schematized since Horace was a substantial influence in the ninth century as well. Traube had focused too much on Horace's ''Satires''.<ref>B. Bischoff, ''Living with the satirists'', 83\u201395</ref> Almost all of Horace's work found favor in the Medieval period. In fact medieval scholars were also guilty of over-schematism, associating Horace's different genres with the different ages of man. A twelfth century scholar encapsulated the theory: \"...Horace wrote four different kinds of poems on account of the four ages, the ''Odes'' for boys, the ''Ars Poetica'' for young men, the ''Satires'' for mature men, the ''Epistles'' for old and complete men.\"<ref>K. Friis-Jensen,''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 291</ref> It was even thought that Horace had composed his works in the  order in which they had been placed by ancient scholars.<ref group=\"nb\">According to a medieval French commentary on the ''Satires'': \"...first he composed his lyrics, and in them, speaking to the young, as it were, he took as subject-matter love affairs and quarrels, banquets and drinking parties. Next he wrote his ''Epodes'', and in them composed invectives against men of a more advanced and more dishonourable age...He next wrote his book about the ''Ars Poetica'', and in that instructed men of his own profession to write well...Later he added his book of ''Satires'', in which he reproved those who had fallen a prey to various kinds of vices. Finally he finished his oeuvre with the ''Epistles'', and in them, following the method of a good farmer, he sowed the virtues where he had rooted out the vices.\" (cited by K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 294\u2013302)</ref> Despite its naivety, the schematism involved an appreciation of Horace's works as a collection, the ''Ars Poetica'', ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' appearing to find favour as well as the ''Odes''. The later Middle Ages however gave special significance to ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', being considered Horace's mature works. [[Dante]] referred to Horace as ''Orazio satiro'', and he awarded him a privileged position in the first circle of Hell, with [[Homer]], Ovid and [[Lucan]].<ref>K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 293, 304</ref>\n\nHorace's popularity is revealed in the large number of quotes from all his works found in almost every genre of medieval literature, and also in the number of poets imitating him in [[Prosody (Latin)#Two rhythms|quantitative Latin meter]] . The most prolific imitator of his ''Odes'' was the Bavarian monk, [[Metellus of Tegernsee]], who dedicated his work to the patron saint of [[Tegernsee Abbey]],  [[Quirinus of Tegernsee|St Quirinus]], around the year 1170. He imitated all Horace's lyrical meters then followed these up with imitations of other meters used by Prudentius and Boethius, indicating that variety, as first modelled by Horace, was considered a fundamental aspect of the lyric genre. The content of his poems however  was restricted to simple piety.<ref>K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 296\u20138</ref> Among the most successful imitators of ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' was another Germanic author, calling himself [[Sextus Amarcius]], around 1100, who composed four books, the first two exemplifying vices, the second pair mainly virtues.<ref>K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 302</ref>\n\n[[Petrarch]] is a key figure in the imitation of Horace in accentual meters. His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the ''Epistles'' and he wrote a letter to Horace in the form of an ode. However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets. One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety.<ref>K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 299</ref> In France, Horace and [[Pindar]] were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the [[Pl\u00e9iade]], including for example [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]. [[Montaigne]] made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes.<ref>Michael McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306</ref> The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Juan Bosc\u00e1n]] [[S\u00e1 de Miranda]], [[Antonio Ferreira]] and [[Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n]], the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme ''beatus ille'' (''happy the man'').<ref>E. Rivers, ''Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n: The Original Poems''</ref> The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century). The first English translator was [[Thomas Drant]], who placed translations of [[Jeremiah]] and Horace side by side in ''Medicinable Morall'', 1566. That was also the year that the Scot [[George Buchanan]] paraphrased the [[Psalms]] in a Horatian setting. [[Ben Jonson]] put Horace on the stage in 1601 in ''[[Poetaster]]'', along with other classical Latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation. Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers look for in his poems.<ref>M. McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306\u20137, 313\u201316</ref>\n\n===Age of Enlightenment===\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or the [[Age of Enlightenment]], neo-classical culture was pervasive. English literature in the middle of that period has been dubbed [[Augustan literature|Augustan]]. It is not always easy to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, ''Horace Juvenal'').<ref group=\"nb\">'Horace Juvenal' was author of ''Modern manners: a poem'', 1793</ref> However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 318, 331, 332</ref>\n\nNew editions of his works were published almost yearly. There were three new editions in 1612 (two in [[Leiden]], one in [[Frankfurt]]) and again in 1699 ([[Utrecht]], [[Barcelona]], [[Cambridge]]). Cheap editions were plentiful and fine editions were also produced, including one whose entire text was engraved by [[John Pine]] in [[copperplate engraving|copperplate]]. The poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] owned five editions of Horace's work and the physician [[James Douglas (physician)|James Douglas]] had five hundred books with Horace-related titles. Horace was often commended in periodicals such as [[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]], as a hallmark of good judgement, moderation and manliness, a focus for moralising.<ref group=\"nb\">see for example ''Spectator'' '''312''', 27 Feb. 1712; '''548''', 28 Nov. 1712; '''618''', 10 Nov. 1714</ref> His verses offered a fund of mottoes, such as ''[[simplex munditiis]]'', (elegance in simplicity) ''[[splendide mendax]]'' (nobly untruthful.), ''[[sapere aude]]'', ''[[nunc est bibendum]]'', ''[[carpe diem]]'' (the latter perhaps being the only one still in common use today),<ref name=\"Tarrant\"/> quoted even in works as prosaic as [[Edmund Quincy (1703-1788)|Edmund Quincy]]'s ''A treatise of hemp-husbandry'' (1765). The fictional hero [[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]] recited his verses with feeling.<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 322</ref> His works were also used to justify commonplace themes, such as patriotic obedience, as in James Parry's English lines from an Oxford University collection in 1736:<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 326\u20137</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n:What friendly [[Muse]] will teach my Lays\n:To emulate the Roman fire?\n:Justly to sound a Caeser's praise\n:Demands a bold Horatian lyre.}}\n\nHoratian-style lyrics were increasingly typical of Oxford and Cambridge verse collections for this period, most of them in Latin but some like the previous ode in English. [[John Milton]]'s [[Lycidas]] first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoes<ref group=\"nb\">One echo of Horace may be found in line 69: \"''Were it not better done as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade/Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?''\", which points to the Neara in ''Odes'' 3.14.21 (Douglas Bush, ''Milton: Poetical Works'', 144, note 69)</ref> yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of ''Odes'' 1.5, and [[Paradise Lost]] includes references to Horace's 'Roman' ''Odes'' 3.1\u20136 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of ''Odes'' 3.4).<ref>J. Talbot, ''A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost'', 21\u20133</ref> Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqu\u00e9. Thus for example [[Benjamin Loveling]] authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady \"of salacious memory\".<ref>B. Loveling, ''Latin and English Poems'', 49\u201352, 79\u201383</ref> Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by [[Anthony Alsop]] that included a rallying cry for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause. On the other hand, [[Andrew Marvell]] took inspiration from Horace's ''Odes'' 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece [[Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland]], in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of [[Cleopatra]] (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). [[Samuel Johnson]] took particular pleasure in reading ''The Odes''.<ref group=\"nb\">Cfr. [[James Boswell]], \"The Life of [[Samuel Johnson]]\" ''Aetat.'' 20, 1729 where Boswell remarked of Johnson that Horace's ''Odes'' \"were the compositions in which he took most delight.\"</ref> [[Alexander Pope]] wrote direct ''Imitations'' of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in ''Essays'' and  [[The Rape of the Lock]]. He even emerged as \"a quite Horatian Homer\" in his translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 329\u201331</ref> Horace appealed also to female poets, such as [[Anna Seward]] (''Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace'', 1799) and [[Elizabeth Tollet]],  who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's [[symposium|sympotic]] settings:\n\n{| style=\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"400px\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|- Valign=top\n|\nQuos procax nobis numeros, jocosque<br />\nMusa dictaret? mihi dum tibique<br />\nTemperent baccis Arabes, vel herbis<br />\nPocula Seres<ref>E.

Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 329</ref>\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\nHorace's ''Ars Poetica'' is second only to Aristotle's ''Poetics'' in its influence on literary theory and criticism. Milton recommended both works in his treatise ''of Education''.<ref>A. Gilbert, ''Literary Criticism: Plato to Dryden'', 124, 669</ref> Horace's ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' however also had a huge impact, influencing theorists and critics such as [[John Dryden]].<ref>W. Kupersmith, ''Roman Satirists in Seventeenth Century England'', 97\u2013101</ref> There was considerable debate over the value of different lyrical forms for contemporary poets, as represented on one hand by the kind of four-line stanzas made familiar by Horace's Sapphic and Alcaic ''Odes'' and, on the other, the loosely structured [[Pindarics]] associated with the odes of [[Pindar]]. Translations occasionally involved scholars in the dilemmas of censorship. Thus [[Christopher Smart]] entirely omitted ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen X|4.10]] and re-numbered the remaining odes. He also removed the ending of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen I|4.1]]. [[Thomas Creech]] printed ''Epodes'' [[:wikisource:la:Epodi#VIII|8]] and [[:wikisource:la:Epodi#XII|12]] in the original Latin but left out their English translations. [[Philip Francis (translator)|Philip Francis]] left out both the English and Latin for those same two epodes, a gap in the numbering  the only indication that something was amiss. French editions of Horace were influential in England and these too were regularly [[bowdlerize]]d.\n\nMost European nations had their own 'Horaces': thus for example [[Friedrich von Hagedorn]] was called ''The German Horace'' and [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] ''The Polish Horace'' (the latter was much imitated by English poets such as [[Henry Vaughan]] and [[Abraham Cowley]]). Pope [[Urban VIII]] wrote voluminously in Horatian meters, including an ode on gout.<ref>D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 319\u201325</ref>\n\n===19th century on===\n\nHorace maintained a central role in the education of English-speaking elites right up until the 1960s.<ref>S.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]] produced a version of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXXVIII|1.38]] in which Horace's questionable 'boy' became 'Lucy', and [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] translated the boy innocently as 'child'. Horace was translated by [[Sir Theodore Martin]] (biographer of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]) but minus some ungentlemanly verses, such as the erotic ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXV|1.25]] and ''Epodes'' 8 and 12.

[[Kipling]] wrote a famous [[parody]] of the ''Odes'', satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story ''Regulus'' in the school collection ''[[Stalky & Co.]]'', which he based on ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber III/Carmen V|3.5]].<ref>S. Medcalfe, ''Kipling's Horace'', 217\u201339</ref> Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion.

In the 1990s, the product line evolved from an [[operating environment]] into a fully complete, modern [[operating system]] over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase.\n\nThe first versions of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were [[graphical shell]]s that run from MS-DOS; later on, [[Windows 95]], though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a [[16-bit]] DOS-based kernel and a [[32-bit]] [[Userland (computing)|user space]]. Windows 95 introduced many features that have been part of the product ever since, including the [[Start menu]], the [[taskbar#Microsoft Windows|taskbar]], and [[Windows Explorer]] (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released [[Internet Explorer 4]] which included the (at the time) controversial [[Windows Desktop Update]]. It aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the [[World Wide Web|web]] into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, such as the ability to display [[JPEG]] images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|anti-trust case in the United States]]. Windows 98 also includes [[plug and play]], which allows devices to work when plugged in without requiring a system reboot or manual configuration, and USB support out of the box. [[Windows ME]], the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced [[System Restore]], [[Help and Support Center]], updated versions of the [[Disk Defragmenter (Windows)|Disk Defragmenter]] and other system tools.\n\nIn 1993, Microsoft released [[Windows NT 3.1]], the first version of the newly-developed [[Windows NT]] operating system. Unlike the [[Windows 9x]] series of operating systems, it is a fully 32-bit operating system. NT 3.1 introduced [[NTFS]], a file system designed to replace the older [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) which was used by DOS and the DOS-based Windows operating systems. In 1996, Windows NT 4.0 was released, which includes a fully 32-bit version of Windows Explorer written specifically for it, making the operating system work just like Windows 95. Windows NT was originally designed to be used on high-end systems and servers, however with the release of [[Windows 2000]], many consumer-oriented features from Windows 95 and Windows 98 were included, such as the [[Windows Desktop Update]], [[Internet Explorer 5]], USB support and [[Windows Media Player]]. These consumer-oriented features were continued and further extended in [[Windows XP]], which introduced a new theme called [[Luna (theme)|Luna]], a more user-friendly interface, updated versions of Windows Media Player and [[Internet Explorer 6|Internet Explorer]], and extended features from Windows Me, such as the Help and Support Center and System Restore. [[Windows Vista]] focused on securing the Windows operating system against [[computer virus]]es and other [[Malware|malicious software]] by introducing features such as [[User Account Control]]. New features include [[Windows Aero]], updated versions of the standard games (e.g. [[Microsoft Solitaire|Solitaire]]), Windows Movie Maker, and Windows Mail to replace [[Outlook Express]]. Despite this, Windows Vista was critically panned for its poor performance on older hardware and its at-the-time high system requirements. [[Windows 7]] followed two and a half years later, and despite technically having higher system requirements,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/kb/919183|title=System requirements for Windows Vista|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=April 18, 2017|access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/10737/windows-7-system-requirements|title=Windows 7 system requirements|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=April 12, 2017|access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> reviewers noted that it ran better than Windows Vista.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/ways-windows-7-beats-windows-vista-3507044|title=Want to Upgrade from Vista to Windows 7?

[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 8.1]], a free upgrade for Windows 8, introduced many controversial changes, such as the replacement of the Start menu with the Start Screen, the removal of the [[Windows Aero|Aero glass]] interface in favor of a flat, colored interface as well as the introduction of \"Metro\" apps (later renamed to [[Universal Windows Platform apps]]) and the Charms Bar user interface element, all of which received considerable criticism from reviewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2012830/windows-8-the-official-review.html|title=Windows 8: The official review|newspaper=[[PCWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|access-date=January 10, 2017|first=Loyd|last=Case|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2618073/microsoft-windows/windows-8-review--yes--it-s-that-bad.html|title=Windows 8 review: Yes, it's that bad|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|newspaper=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|date=August 15, 2012|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/products/microsoft/windows/8/|title=Microsoft 8 review|website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe current version of Windows, [[Windows 10]], reintroduced the Start menu and added the ability to run Universal Windows Platform apps in a window instead of always in full screen.

Instead, \"feature updates\" are released twice a year with names such as \"Creators Update\" and \"Fall Creators Update\" that introduce new capabilities.\n\n== Windows 1.x ==\n{{Main article|Windows 1.0}}\n\nThe first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on November 20, 1985, achieved little popularity. The project was briefly codenamed \"Interface Manager\" before the windowing system was developed - contrary to popular belief that it was the original name for Windows and [[Rowland Hanson]], the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name ''Windows'' would be more appealing to customers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Rowland|title=WINDOWS IS NAMED WINDOWS : BUT WHY?|url=http://thehmccompany.com/category/rowland-hanson/}}</ref>\n\nWindows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an \"operating environment\" that extended [[MS-DOS]], and shared the latter's inherent flaws and errors.\n\nThe first version of Microsoft Windows included a simple graphics painting program called [[Microsoft Paint|Windows Paint]]; [[Microsoft Write|Windows Write]], a simple [[word processor]]; an appointment calendar; a card-filer; a [[Notepad (Windows)|notepad]]; a clock; a [[control panel (computer)|control panel]]; a [[computer terminal]]; [[Clipboard (software)|Clipboard]]; and [[RAM]] driver. It also included the [[MS-DOS Executive]] and a game called [[Reversi]].\n\nMicrosoft had worked with [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] to develop applications for Apple's new [[Macintosh]] computer, which featured a [[graphical user interface]]. As part of the related business negotiations, Microsoft had licensed certain aspects of the Macintosh user interface from Apple; in later litigation, a district court summarized these aspects as \"screen displays\".\nIn the development of Windows 1.0, Microsoft intentionally limited its borrowing of certain GUI elements from the Macintosh user interface, to comply with its license. For example, windows were only displayed \"tiled\" on the screen; that is, they could not overlap or overlie one another.\n\n== Windows 2.x ==\n{{Main article|Windows 2.0|Windows 2.1x}}\n\nMicrosoft Windows version 2 came out on December 9, 1987, and proved slightly more popular than its predecessor.\nMuch of the popularity for [[Windows 2.0]] came by way of its inclusion as a \"run-time version\" with Microsoft's new graphical applications, [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Microsoft Word|Word for Windows]]. They could be run from MS-DOS, executing Windows for the duration of their activity, and closing down Windows upon exit.\n\nMicrosoft Windows received a major boost around this time when [[Aldus]] [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] appeared in a Windows version, having previously run only on [[Macintosh]]. Some computer historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} date this, the first appearance of a significant ''and'' non-Microsoft application for Windows, as the start of the success of Windows.\n\nVersions 2.0x used the [[real mode|real-mode]] [[computer storage|memory]] model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 [[megabyte]] of memory.\nIn such a configuration, it could run under another multitasker like [[DESQview]], which used the [[Intel 80286|286]] [[protected mode]].\n\nLater, two new versions were released: [[Windows/286]] 2.1 and [[Windows/386]] 2.1. Like prior versions of Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but was the first version to support the [[High Memory Area]]. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with [[LIM EMS|LIM-standard EMS]] [[Hardware emulation|emulation]]. All Windows and DOS-based applications at the time were real mode, running over the protected mode kernel by using the [[virtual 8086 mode]], which was new with the 80386 processor.\n\nVersion 2.03, and later 3.0, faced challenges from Apple over its overlapping windows and other features Apple charged mimicked the ostensibly copyrighted \"look and feel\" of its operating system and \"embodie[d] and generated a copy of the Macintosh\" in its OS. Judge William Schwarzer dropped all but 10 of Apple's 189 claims of copyright infringement, and ruled that most of the remaining 10 were over uncopyrightable ideas.\n\n== Windows 3.0 ==\n{{Main article|Windows 3.0}}\n\n[[Windows 3.0]], released in May 1990, improved capabilities given to native applications. It also allowed users to better [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of [[virtual memory]].\n\nWindows 3.0's user interface finally resembled a serious competitor to the user interface of the [[Macintosh]] computer. PCs had improved graphics by this time, due to [[VGA]] video cards, and the protected/enhanced mode allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could. Windows 3.0 could run in real, standard, or 386 enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the [[Intel 8086|8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] up to the [[Intel 80286|80286]] and [[Intel 80386|80386]]. This was the first version to run Windows programs in protected mode, although the 386 enhanced mode [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] was an enhanced version of the protected mode kernel in Windows/386.\n\nWindows 3.0 received two updates. A few months after introduction, Windows 3.0a was released as a maintenance release, resolving bugs and improving stability. A \"multimedia\" version, Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, was released in October 1991. This was bundled with \"multimedia upgrade kits\", comprising a [[CD-ROM drive]] and a [[sound card]], such as the [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster Pro]]. This version was the precursor to the multimedia features available in [[Windows 3.1]] (first released in April 1992) and later, and was part of Microsoft's specification for the [[Multimedia PC]].\n\nThe features listed above and growing market support from application software developers made Windows 3.0 wildly successful, selling around 10 million copies in the two years before the release of version 3.1. Windows 3.0 became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise some of its earlier plans. Support was discontinued on December 31, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=The end of an era - Windows 3.x |author=Mark Ward |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7707016.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== OS/2 ==\n{{Main article|OS/2}}\n\n[[File:Os2logo.svg|thumb|right|OS/2 logo]]\n\nDuring the mid to late 1980s, Microsoft and [[IBM]] had cooperatively been developing [[OS/2]] as a successor to DOS. OS/2 would take full advantage of the aforementioned protected mode of the [[Intel 80286]] processor and up to 16&nbsp;MB of memory. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported swapping and multitasking and allowed running of [[DOS]] executables.\n\nIBM licensed Windows's [[graphical user interface|GUI]] for OS/2 as [[Presentation Manager]], and the two companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost identical.<ref name=\"alsop19880118\">{{Cite journal |last=Alsop |first=Stewart II |date=January 18, 1988 |title=Microsoft Windows: Eclectism in UI |url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/PC-Letter_19880118.pdf |journal=P.C. Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=6-7}}</ref> Presentation Manager was not available with OS/2 until version 1.1, released in 1988. Its [[application programming interface|API]] was incompatible with Windows. Version 1.2, released in 1989, introduced a new [[file system]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], to replace the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system.\n\nBy the early 1990s, conflicts developed in the Microsoft/IBM relationship. They cooperated with each other in developing their PC operating systems, and had access to each other's code. Microsoft wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.\n\nThis agreement soon fell apart however, and the Microsoft/IBM relationship was terminated. IBM continued to develop OS/2, while Microsoft changed the name of its (as yet unreleased) OS/2 3.0 to [[Windows NT]]. Both retained the rights to use OS/2 and Windows technology developed up to the termination of the agreement; Windows NT, however, was to be written anew, mostly independently (see below).\n\nAfter an interim 1.3 version to fix up many remaining problems with the 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was considered by many to be OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and could take advantage of the 4&nbsp;gigabytes of address space provided by the [[Intel 80386]]. Still, much of the system had 16-bit code internally which required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code also. This was one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.\n\n== Windows 3.1x ==\n{{Main article|Windows 3.1x}}\n\nIn response to the impending release of OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed [[Windows 3.1x#Windows 3.1|Windows 3.1]] (first released in April 1992), which included several improvements to Windows 3.0, such as display of [[TrueType]] scalable fonts (developed jointly with Apple), improved disk performance in 386 Enhanced Mode, multimedia support, and bugfixes. It also removed Real Mode, and only ran on an [[Intel 80286|80286]] or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, Microsoft released Windows for Workgroups (WfW), which was available both as an add-on for existing Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support for peer-to-peer networking.  There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 and WfW 3.11. Unlike prior versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 ran in 386 Enhanced Mode only, and needed at least an [[80386SX]] processor. One optional download for WfW was the \"Wolverine\" TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for easy access to the Internet through corporate networks.\n\nAll these versions continued version 3.0's impressive sales pace. Even though the 3.1x series still lacked most of the important features of OS/2, such as long file names, a desktop, or protection of the system against misbehaving applications, Microsoft quickly took over the OS and GUI markets for the [[IBM PC]]. The [[Windows API]] became the de facto standard for consumer software.\n\n== Windows NT 3.x ==\n{{Main article|Windows NT|Windows NT 3.1|Windows NT 3.5|Windows NT 3.51}}\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was [[Dave Cutler]], one of the chief architects of [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (later acquired by [[Compaq]], now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]).<ref name=\"ntvmsrussinovich\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1990s/98/12_b.htm\n |title       = Windows NT and VMS: The Rest of the Story\n |last        = Russinovich\n |first       = Mark\n |authorlink  = Mark Russinovich\n |date        = December 1998\n |accessdate  = December 16, 2008\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130112184237/http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1990s/98/12_b.htm\n |archivedate = January 12, 2013\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> Microsoft hired him in October 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Cutler had been developing a follow-on to [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] called Mica, and when DEC dropped the project he brought the expertise and around 20 engineers with him to Microsoft. DEC also believed he brought Mica's code to Microsoft and sued.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/7153/the-death-of-alpha-on-nt.html\n|title=The Death of Alpha on NT\n|last=Smith\n|first=Mark\n|date=August 27, 1999\n|accessdate=December 16, 2008\n|publisher=Windows IT Pro\n}}</ref> Microsoft eventually paid US$150 million and agreed to support DEC's [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] CPU chip in NT.\n\nWindows NT Workstation (Microsoft marketing wanted Windows NT to appear to be a continuation of Windows 3.1) arrived in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 [[Professional Developers Conference]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blogs.technet.com/sysinternals/archive/2000/06/14/452892.aspx\n|title=Sysinternals Site Discussion: Volume 2, Number 3\n|last=Russinovich\n|first=Mark\n|date=June 14, 2000\n|accessdate=December 16, 2008\n|authorlink=Mark Russinovich\n|publisher=[[Winternals]]\n}}</ref> Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement ([[Windows 95]], codenamed Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]]. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until [[Windows XP]]\u2014albeit [[Windows 2000]], oriented to business, had already unified most of the system\u2019s bolts and gears, it was XP that was sold to home consumers like Windows 95 and came to be viewed as the final unified OS. Parts of Cairo have still not made it into Windows as of 2017 - most notably, the [[WinFS]] file system, which was the much touted Object File System of Cairo. Microsoft announced that they have discontinued the separate release of WinFS for Windows XP and Windows Vista<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/winfs/archive/2006/06/23/644706.aspx\n|title=What's in Store: WinFS Update\n|last=Clark\n|first=Quentin\n|date=June 23, 2006\n|work=[[MSDN Blogs]]\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref> and will gradually incorporate the technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably [[Microsoft SQL Server]].\n\nDriver support was lacking due to the increased programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line all the way through Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.\n\nHowever, these same features made Windows NT perfect for the [[local area network|LAN]] server market (which in 1993 was experiencing a rapid boom, as office networking was becoming common). NT also had advanced network connectivity options and [[NTFS]], an efficient file system. Windows NT version 3.51 was Microsoft's entry into this field, and took away market share from Novell (the dominant player) in the following years.\n\nOne of Microsoft's biggest advances initially developed for Windows NT was a new 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit [[Windows API]]. This API was called [[Win32]], and from then on Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as [[Win16]]. The Win32 API had three levels of implementation: the complete one for Windows NT, a subset for Chicago (originally called [[Win32c]]) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and [[Unicode]] support, and a more limited subset called [[Win32s]] which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows NT, even though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.\n\nAs released, Windows NT 3.x went through three versions (3.1, 3.5, and 3.51); changes were primarily internal and reflected back end changes. The 3.5 release added support for new types of hardware and improved performance and data reliability; the 3.51 release was primarily to update the Win32 APIs to be compatible with software being written for the Win32c APIs in what became Windows 95.\n\n== Windows 95 ==\n{{Main article|Windows 95}}\n\nAfter [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system codenamed Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 [[Application programming interface|API]] first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as \"[[thunk (compatibility mapping)|thunking]]\". A new [[Object-oriented design|object oriented]] GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped.\n\nMicrosoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using [[real mode]]) for reasons of compatibility, performance, and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors eventually began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability.\n\nMicrosoft marketing adopted [[Windows 95]] as the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995. Microsoft had a double gain from its release: first, it made it impossible for consumers to run Windows 95 on a cheaper, non-Microsoft DOS; secondly, although traces of DOS were never completely removed from the system and MS DOS 7 would be loaded briefly as a part of the [[booting]] process, Windows 95 applications ran solely in 386 enhanced mode, with a flat 32-bit address space and [[virtual memory]]. These features make it possible for Win32 applications to address up to 2 [[gigabyte]]s of virtual RAM (with another 2&nbsp;GB reserved for the operating system), and in theory prevented them from inadvertently corrupting the memory space of other Win32 applications. In this respect the functionality of Windows 95 moved closer to [[Windows NT]], although Windows 95/98/ME did not support more than 512 [[megabyte]]s of physical RAM without obscure system tweaks.\n\n[[IBM]] continued to market OS/2, producing later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer hardware, version 3.0 was significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware vendor chains. However, with the release of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose market share.\n\nIt is probably impossible to choose one specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much market share. While OS/2 continued to run Windows 3.1 applications, it lacked support for anything but the [[Win32s]] subset of Win32 API (see above). Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did not have access to the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.\n\nMicrosoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95:\n* Windows 95 - original release\n* Windows 95 A - included Windows 95 OSR1 [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreamed]] into the installation.\n* Windows 95 B - (OSR2) included several major enhancements, [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) 3.0 and full [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system support.\n* Windows 95 B USB - (OSR2.1) included basic [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] support.\n* Windows 95&nbsp;C - (OSR2.5) included all the above features, plus IE 4.0. This was the last 95 version produced.\n\nOSR2, OSR2.1, and OSR2.5 were not released to the general public; rather, they were available only to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive's capacity).\n\nThe first [[Microsoft Plus!]] add-on pack was sold for Windows 95.\n\n== Windows NT 4.0 ==\n{{Main article|Windows NT 4.0}}\n\n[[Windows NT 4.0]] was the successor of  [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]] (1994) and [[Windows NT 3.51|3.51]] (1995). Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, one year after the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, scalability and feature improvements to the core [[Architecture of Windows NT|architecture]], kernel, [[Windows USER|USER32]], [[Component Object Model|COM]] and [[MSRPC]].<ref name=\"NT4UndertheHood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/archive/S413.aspx |title=Poking Around Under the Hood: A Programmer's View of Windows NT 4.0 |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWindows NT 4.0 came in four versions:\n* Windows NT 4.0 Workstation\n* Windows NT 4.0 Server\n* Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition (includes support for 8-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] and [[cluster (computing)|clustering]])\n* Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server\n\n== Windows 98 ==\n{{Main article|Windows 98}}\n\n[[File:Windows98.png|thumb|right|200px|Windows 98 desktop]]\n\nOn June 25, 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis). It included new hardware drivers and the [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system which supports disk partitions that are larger than 2&nbsp;GB (first introduced in Windows 95 OSR2). [[USB]] support in Windows 98 is marketed as a vast improvement over Windows 95. The release continued the controversial inclusion of the [[Internet Explorer]] browser with the operating system that started with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1. The action eventually led to the filing of the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case, dealing with the question of whether Microsoft was introducing unfair practices into the market in an effort to eliminate competition from other companies such as [[Netscape]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/1764.htm |title=Justice Department Files Antitrust Suit Against Microsoft For Unlawfully Monopolizing Computer Software Markets |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=May 18, 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98&nbsp;Second Edition, an interim release. One of the more notable new features was the addition of [[Internet Connection Sharing]], a form of [[network address translation]], allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single [[Internet connection]]. Hardware support through device drivers was increased and this version shipped with Internet Explorer 5.

[[Terminal Services]], previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved Device Manager, [[Windows Media Player]], and a revised [[DirectX]] that made it possible for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel.

The merging of the Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95/98/Me lines was finally achieved with Windows XP. Windows XP uses the Windows NT 5.1 [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], marking the entrance of the Windows NT core to the consumer market, to replace the aging 16/32-bit branch. The initial release met with considerable [[Criticism of Windows XP|criticism]], particularly in the area of [[Information Security|security]], leading to the release of three major [[Service Pack]]s. Windows XP SP1 was released in September 2002, SP2 came out in August 2004 and SP3 came out in April 2008. Service Pack 2 provided significant improvements and encouraged widespread adoption of XP among both home and business users. Windows XP lasted longer as Microsoft's flagship operating system than any other version of Windows, from October 25, 2001 to January 30, 2007 when it was succeeded by Windows Vista.\n\nWindows XP is available in a number of versions:\n* [[Windows XP Home Edition]], for home desktops and [[laptop]]s - lacked features such as joining [[Active Directory]] Domain, [[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]] Server and [[Internet Information Services]] Server.\n** Windows XP Home Edition N, as above, but without a default installation of [[Windows Media Player]], as mandated by a [[European Union]] ruling\n* [[Windows XP Professional]], for business and power users contained all features in Home Edition.\n** Windows XP Professional N, as above, but without a default installation of Windows Media Player, as mandated by a European Union ruling\n* [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] (MCE), released in October 2002 for desktops and notebooks with an emphasis on home entertainment.

It is only available to [[Microsoft Software Assurance|Software Assurance]] customers. The aim of WinFLP is to give companies a viable upgrade option for older PCs that are running Windows 95, 98, and ME that will be supported with patches and updates for the next several years. Most user applications will typically be run on a remote machine using Terminal Services or [[Citrix]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Windows Home Server===\n{{Main article|Windows Home Server}}\n\nWindows Home Server (codenamed Q, Quattro) is a server product based on [[Windows Server 2003]], designed for consumer use. The system was announced on January 7, 2007 by [[Russel Adolfo]]. Windows Home Server can be configured and monitored using a console program that can be installed on a client PC. Such features as Media Sharing, local and remote drive backup and file duplication are all listed as features.  The release of Windows Home Server Power Pack 3 added support for [[Windows 7]] to Windows Home Server.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Windows Vista and Server 2008 ==\n{{Main article|Windows Vista|Features new to Windows Vista|Development of Windows Vista|Criticisms of Windows Vista|List of features removed in Windows Vista}}\n\n[[File:Windows Vista.png|thumbnail|Windows Vista Desktop]]\n\n[[Windows Vista]] was released on November 30, 2006 to business customers - consumer versions followed on January 30, 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode called [[User Account Control]], replacing the \"administrator-by-default\" philosophy of Windows XP.  Vista was the target of much criticism and negative press, and in general was not well regarded; this was seen as leading to the relatively swift release of Windows 7.\n\nOne major difference between Vista and earlier versions of Windows, Windows 95 and later, is that the original start button was replaced with the Windows icon in a circle (called the Start Orb). Vista also features new graphics features, the [[Windows Aero]] [[GUI]], new applications (such as [[Windows Calendar]], Windows DVD Maker and some new games including [[Chess]], [[Mahjong]], and [[Purble Place]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/games-explorer.aspx?tabid=2&catid=1|title=Explore the features: Games Explorer|work=[[Windows]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812203820/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/games-explorer.aspx?tabid=2&catid=1|archivedate=August 12, 2008}}</ref> [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Windows Media Player 11]], and a large number of underlying architectural changes.

Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], which at the time was the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki and eventually became the modern [[University of Helsinki]]. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style to resemble Saint Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel|C. L. Engel]]. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and [[industrialization]] were key factors behind the city's growth.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nDespite the tumultuous nature of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century (including the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Winter War]] which both left marks on the city), Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]], held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the [[Helsinki Metro]] subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Helsinki SPOT 1021.jpg|thumb|left|Parts of Helsinki and [[Espoo]] seen from the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]]]]\n{{Main article|Geography of Helsinki}}\n\nCalled the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Helsinki is on the tip of a peninsula and on 315 islands.

Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is very high, reaching {{convert|16494|PD/km2}} in the district of [[Kallio]], but as a whole Helsinki's population density of {{convert|3050|/km2}} ranks the city as rather sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geography of Helsinki, Overview of Finland|url=http://www.easyexpat.com/en/guides/finland/helsinki/overview/geography.htm|work=easyexpat.com|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki&nbsp;\u2014 School of Computer Science&nbsp;\u2014 SOCS|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Helsinki.htm|work=[[McGill University]]|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref> Outside of the inner city, much of Helsinki consists of postwar suburbs separated by patches of forest. A narrow, {{conv|10|km}} long [[Central Park (Helsinki)|Helsinki Central Park]], stretching from the inner city to Helsinki's northern border, is an important recreational area for residents. The City of Helsinki has about 11,000 boat [[Berth (moorings)|berths]] and possesses over 14,000 hectares of marine fishing waters adjacent to the Capital Region. Some 60 fish species are found in this area and recreational fishing is popular.\n\nMajor islands in Helsinki include [[Seurasaari]], [[Vallisaari]], [[Lauttasaari]], and [[Korkeasaari]]&nbsp;\u2013 the lattermost being the site of Finland\u2019s largest [[zoo]].

All TV channels are broadcast [[Digital television|digitally]], both terrestrially and on cable. \n\nThe commercial television channel [[MTV3]] and commercial radio channel [[Radio Nova (Finland)|Radio Nova]] are owned by Nordic Broadcasting ([[Bonnier Group|Bonnier]] and Proventus Industrier).\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main article|Sport in Helsinki}}\n[[File:2005 World Championships in Athletics 2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] was the centre of activities during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nHelsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]] 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: [[association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Helsinki houses [[HJK Helsinki]], Finland's largest and most successful football club, and [[HIFK Fotboll|IFK Helsingfors]], their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as [[Stadin derby]]. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs [[HIFK (ice hockey)|IFK Helsingfors]] (HIFK) or [[Jokerit]]. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest [[bandy]] division,<ref>Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from [[Oulu]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-j0t5yxIE&feature=related Youtube.com]</ref> along with [[Botnia-69]]. The Olympic stadium hosted the first ever [[Bandy World Championship]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finbandy.fi/info.htm |title=The Finnish Bandy Federation |accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nHelsinki was elected host-city of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II they were canceled. Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the [[European Figure Skating Championships]], and in 2017 it hosted [[World Figure Skating Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki2017.com|title=World Figure Skating Championships 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Helsinki region roads.jpg|thumb|right|Helsinki region roads]]\nThe backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three [[semicircle|semicircular]] [[ring road|beltways]], [[Ring I]], [[Ring II]], and [[Ring III]], which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of ''[[L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' and ''[[It\u00e4v\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' respectively. While variants of a ''Keskustatunneli'' tunnel under the city centre have been repeatedly proposed, {{As of|2017|lc=y}} the plan remains on the drawing board.\n\nHelsinki has some 390 cars per 1000 inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.hel2.fi/tietoa/helbro1.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211115004/http://www.hel2.fi/tietoa/helbro1.pdf|date=11 December 2011}}</ref> This is less than in cities of similar population and construction density, such as [[Brussels]]' 483 per 1000, [[Stockholm]]'s 401, and [[Oslo]]'s 413.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eaue.de/Promode/Runge.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625143315/http://www.eaue.de/Promode/Runge.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2008 |title=Runge |publisher=European Academy of the Urban Environment |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/suunnat/ss405/suunnatframe2.html |title=Tietokeskus: suunnatframe |publisher=Hel2.fi |accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Intercity rail===\n\nThe [[Helsinki Central Railway Station]] is the main terminus of the rail network in Finland. Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to [[Tampere]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]]), and the Coastal Line to the west (to [[Turku]]). The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via [[Lahti]] to eastern parts of Finland and to Russia.\n\nA majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day as of 2017. There are international services from Helsinki to [[Saint Petersburg]] and to [[Moscow]] in Russia. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route is operated with the [[Allegro (train)|Allegro high-speed trains]].\n\nA [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]] has been proposed<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/helsinki-tallinn-tunnel-proposals-rail-link-finland-estonia | title = Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel proposals look to bring cities closer than ever | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 6 January 2016}}</ref> and agreed upon by representatives of the cities.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/helsinki-tallinn-rail-tunnel-baltic/423030/ | date = 7 January 2016 | title = Helsinki and Tallinn Agree to Build the World's Longest Underwater Rail Tunnel| newspaper = CityLab | author = Feargus O'Sullivan}}</ref> The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the [[Estonia]]n capital [[Tallinn]], further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by [[Rail Baltica]].\n\n===Aviation===\nAir traffic is handled primarily from the international [[Helsinki Airport]], located approximately {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]]. Helsinki's own airport, [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], is mainly used for general and private aviation. Charter flights are available from [[Hernesaari Heliport]].\n\n===Sea transport===\n[[File:Helsinki (23883925315).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[South Harbour, Helsinki|South Harbour]]]]\nLike many other cities, Helsinki was deliberately founded at a location on the sea in order to take advantage of shipping. The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of [[icebreaker]]s, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki port|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288689888898.html}}</ref> Ferry connections to [[Tallinn]], [[Mariehamn]], and [[Stockholm]] are serviced by various companies. [[Finnlines]] passenger-freight ferries to [[Gdynia]], Poland; [[Travem\u00fcnde]], Germany; and [[Rostock]], Germany are also available. [[St. Peter Line]] offers passenger ferry service to Saint Petersburg several times a week.\n\n===Urban transport===\n{{Main article|Public transport in Helsinki}}\n[[File:Lauttasaari metro station interior.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Helsinki Metro]] with its characteristic bright orange trains is the world's northernmost subway]]\n[[File:Helsinki Railway Station 20050604.jpg|thumb|[[Helsinki Central railway station|Central railway station]], inaugurated 1919]]\nIn the Helsinki metropolitan area, [[public transport]]ation is managed by the [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority]], the metropolitan area transportation authority. The diverse [[Public transport in Helsinki|public transport system]] consists of [[Helsinki tram|trams]], [[VR commuter rail|commuter rail]], the [[Helsinki Metro|metro]], [[bus]] lines, two [[ferry]] lines and a [[Helsinki City Bikes|public bike system]].\n\n[[Helsinki tram|Helsinki's tram system]] has been in operation with electric drive continuously since 1900. 13 routes that cover the inner part of the city are operated. As of 2017, the city is expanding the tram network, with several major [[Planned extension of the Helsinki tram network|tram line construction projects]] under way. These include the 550 trunk line (Raide-Jokeri), roughly along Ring I around the city center, and a new tramway to the island of Laajasalo.\n \nThe [[Helsinki Metro]], opened in 1982, is the only metro system in Finland, albeit the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] trains operate at metro-like frequencies. In 2006, the construction of the long debated [[L\u00e4nsimetro|extension]] of the metro into Western Helsinki and [[Espoo]] was approved.<ref name=lansimetrofi>{{cite web|url=http://www.lansimetro.fi/ |title=L\u00e4nsimetro rakentaa tulevaisuutta turvallisesti |publisher=Lansimetro.fi |accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> The extension finally opened after delays in November 2017.<ref name=ylelansimetro>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/metro_extension_finally_launched__commuters_rejoice_experts_cautious/9937989 |title=Metro extension finally launched \u2013 commuters rejoice, experts cautious |publisher=Yle |accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> An eastern extension into the planned new district of [[\u00d6stersundom]] and neighboring [[Sipoo]] has also been seriously debated. Helsinki's metro system currently consists of 25 stations, with 14 of them underground.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hsl.fi/en/timetables-and-routes/metro-and-tram-routes|title=Route maps|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Helsinki commuter rail|commuter rail system]] includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the [[Ring Rail Line]], an urban double-track railway with a station at the [[Helsinki Airport]] in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated as of 2017, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Finland}}\n\nHelsinki has no official [[sister cities]],<ref name=pc/> but it has a special partnership relation with:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia<ref name=pc>{{cite web |url=https://www.hel.fi/helsinki/en/administration/enterprises/competitive/international-activities/ |title=International Relations |work=Hel.fi |publisher=City of Helsinki |quote=Helsinki\u2019s main bilateral city partners are St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Stockholm and Berlin.

In 1804, along with the military, settlers and convicts from the abandoned Port Phillip settlement, the camp at Risdon Cove was moved by Captain David Collins to a better location at the present site of Hobart at [[Sullivans Cove]].

He writes of Hobart and the Derwent estuary in his ''Voyage of the Beagle'':\n<blockquote>...The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared; and the bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of potatoes, appear very luxuriant... I was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of the large houses, either built or building.

The settlement rapidly grew into a major port, with allied industries such as shipbuilding.\n\nHobart Town became a city on 21 August 1842, and was renamed Hobart from the beginning of 1881.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8991859 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=1 January 1881 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n<!-- ''(history needed here, including penal colony, seal and whalers, postwar economic decline)'' -->\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography===\n{{Further|List of Hobart suburbs}}\n[[File:LGA Tas SE Hobart.png|thumb|The City of Hobart (green) and Greater Hobart (teal)]]\nHobart is located on the estuary of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] in the state's south-east. Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as Bellerive. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from Bellerive]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|K\u00f6ppen ''Cfb'']]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of Hobart from Mt Wellington, Tasmania, Australia - March 2005 (36662529600).jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Panorama of Hobart from [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] in March 2005]]\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from {{convert|12.5|\u00b0C}} in September to {{convert|16.5|\u00b0C}} in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seatemperature.org/australia-pacific/australia/hobart.htm|title=Hobart Water Temperature - Australia - Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures - A-Connect|last=Ltd|website=World Sea Temperatures}}</ref>\n\n{{Hobart weatherbox}}\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Hobart International Airport|Hobart Airport]] ([[Cambridge, Tasmania|Cambridge]])\n|collapsed=Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 40.3\n| Feb record high C = 39.8\n| Mar record high C = 37.0\n| Apr record high C = 30.7\n| May record high C = 25.6\n| Jun record high C = 19.6\n| Jul record high C = 20.4\n| Aug record high C = 23.7\n| Sep record high C = 31.1\n| Oct record high C = 33.4\n| Nov record high C = 38.5\n| Dec record high C = 39.2\n| Jan high C = 22.6\n| Feb high C = 22.5\n| Mar high C = 20.7\n| Apr high C = 18.1\n| May high C = 15.6\n| Jun high C = 13.0\n| Jul high C = 12.7\n| Aug high C = 13.8\n| Sep high C = 15.5\n| Oct high C = 17.4\n| Nov high C = 19.5\n| Dec high C = 20.8\n| year high C = 17.7\n| Jan low C = 12.2\n| Feb low C = 12.2\n| Mar low C = 10.9\n| Apr low C = 8.8\n| May low C = 6.9\n| Jun low C = 4.7\n| Jul low C = 4.2\n| Aug low C = 5.0\n| Sep low C = 6.3\n| Oct low C = 7.8\n| Nov low C = 9.5\n| Dec low C = 10.9\n| year low C = 8.3\n| Jan record low C = 3.7\n| Feb record low C = 3.4\n| Mar record low C = 2.2\n| Apr record low C = 0.6\n| May record low C = \u22122.2\n| Jun record low C = \u22123.9\n| Jul record low C = \u22123.2\n| Aug record low C = \u22122.0\n| Sep record low C = \u22122.3\n| Oct record low C = \u22121.0\n| Nov record low C = 1.7\n| Dec record low C = 2.7\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 41.1\n| Feb rain mm = 32.5\n| Mar rain mm = 36.2\n| Apr rain mm = 37.4\n| May rain mm = 27.3\n| Jun rain mm = 35.1\n| Jul rain mm = 36.5\n| Aug rain mm = 46.2\n| Sep rain mm = 44.0\n| Oct rain mm = 43.2\n| Nov rain mm = 39.1\n| Dec rain mm = 51.0\n| year rain mm = 469.6\n| unit rain days= 0.2 mm\n| Jan rain days = 9.4\n| Feb rain days = 7.8\n| Mar rain days = 10.0\n| Apr rain days = 10.6\t\n| May rain days = 10.0\n| Jun rain days = 11.4\n| Jul rain days = 13.0 \n| Aug rain days = 12.7\n| Sep rain days = 14.3\n| Oct rain days = 13.7\n| Nov rain days = 12.0\n| Dec rain days = 11.5\n| year rain days = \n| humidity colour = green\n| Jan afthumidity = 49\n| Feb afthumidity = 50\n| Mar afthumidity = 52\n| Apr afthumidity = 55\n| May afthumidity = 59\n| Jun afthumidity = 63\n| Jul afthumidity = 61\n| Aug afthumidity = 57\n| Sep afthumidity = 54\n| Oct afthumidity = 52\n| Nov afthumidity = 51\n| Dec afthumidity = 50\n| year humidity = 54\n| source 1 = [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (1981\u20132010 averages;<ref name=\"BoMAirport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/cvg/av?p_stn_num=094008&p_prim_element_index=0&p_comp_element_index=0&redraw=null&p_display_type=statistics_summary&normals_years=1981-2010&tablesizebutt=normal |title=Climate statistics: Hobart Airport |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]] |access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref> extremes 1958\u2013present)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_094008_All.shtml |title=Hobart Airport monthly climate statistics|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]] |access-date=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{|style=\"width:90%;text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Climate data for Hobart\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!style=\"border-left-width:medium\"|Year\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n| style=\"background:#6b49c8;

The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834\u201336, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847. St Joseph's was built in 1840. [[St David's Cathedral, Hobart|St David's Cathedral]], Hobart's first cathedral, was consecrated in 1874.\n\nHobart has very few [[high rise]] buildings in comparison to other Australian cities.

Hobart also plays host to the University of Tasmania's acclaimed Australian International Symphony Orchestra Institute (AISOI) which brings pre-professional advanced young musicians to town from all over Australia and internationally. The AISOI plays host to a public concert season during the first two weeks of December every year focusing on large symphonic music.

Hobart also includes the urbanised local governments of the [[Municipality of Kingborough]] and [[Municipality of Brighton]]. Each local government services all the suburbs that are within its geographical boundaries and are responsible for their own urban area, up to a certain scale, and residential planning as well as waste management and mains water storage.\n\nMost citywide events such as the Taste of Tasmania and Hobart Summer Festival are funded by the Tasmanian State Government as a joint venture with the Hobart City Council. Urban planning of the Hobart CBD in particular the Heritage listed areas such as Sullivans Cove are also intensely scrutinised by State Government, which is operated out of Parliament House on the waterfront.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in Tasmania}}\n[[File:UTAS Centenary Building.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Tasmania]]'s Centenary Building, Sandy Bay campus]]\n\nHobart is home to the main campus of the [[University of Tasmania]], located in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]].

These schools are made up of a mix of public, catholic, private and independent run, with the heaviest distribution lying in the more densely populated West around the Hobart city core. [[TasTAFE]] operates a total of seven polytechnic campuses within the G.H.A. that provide vocational education and training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tastafe.tas.edu.au/about/|title=About us \u2013 TasTAFE|work=TasTAFE|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main article|Transport in Hobart}}\n[[File:Connection to the east - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Tasman Bridge]]\nThe only [[public transportation]] within the city of Hobart is via a network of [[Metro Tasmania]] buses funded by\nthe Tasmanian Government and a small number of private bus services. Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\n[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hobart International Airport]]]]\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:Cobble Creek, Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|Former Hobart Gas Company]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100 million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]].

[[Epic poetry|Epic narrative]] allowed poets like [[Homer]] no opportunity for personal revelations. However, Hesiod's extant work comprises several [[didactic poem]]s in which he went out of his way to let his audience in on a few details of his life. There are three explicit references in ''[[Works and Days]]'', as well as some passages in his ''[[Theogony]]'' that support inferences made by scholars. The former poem says that his father came from [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]] in [[Aeolis]] (on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], a little south of the island [[Lesbos]]) and crossed the sea to settle at a hamlet, near [[Thespiae]] in [[Boeotia]], named [[Ascra]], \"a cursed place, cruel in winter, hard in summer, never pleasant\" (''Works'' 640). Hesiod's patrimony there, a small piece of ground at the foot of [[Mount Helicon]], occasioned [[lawsuits]] with his brother [[Perses (brother of Hesiod)|Perses]], who seems, at first, to have cheated him of his rightful share thanks to corrupt authorities or \"kings\" but later became impoverished and ended up scrounging from the thrifty poet (''Works'' 35, 396.).\n\nUnlike his father, Hesiod was averse to sea travel, but he once crossed the narrow strait between the Greek mainland and [[Euboea]] to participate in funeral celebrations for one Athamas of [[Chalcis]], and there won a [[tripod]] in a singing competition.<ref>Jasper Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press (1986), pp. 88, 95.</ref> He also describes a meeting between himself and the [[Muses]] on [[Mount Helicon]], where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] staff, a symbol of poetic authority (''Theogony'' 22\u201335). Fanciful though the story might seem, the account has led ancient and modern scholars to infer that he was not a professionally trained [[rhapsode]], or he would have been presented with a [[lyre]] instead.<ref group=\"nb\">See discussion by M. L. West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', Oxford University Press (1966), p. 163 f., note 30, citing for example [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] IX, 30.3. Rhapsodes in post-Homeric times are often shown carrying either a laurel staff or a lyre but in Hesiod's earlier time, the staff seems to indicate that he was not a rhapsode, a professional [[minstrel]]. Meetings between poets and the Muses became part of poetic folklore: compare, for example, [[Archilochus]]' account of his meeting the Muses while leading home a cow, and the legend of [[C\u00e6dmon]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Moreau, Gustave - H\u00e9siode et la Muse - 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|''Hesiod and the [[Muse]]'' (1891), by [[Gustave Moreau]]. The poet is presented with a [[lyre]], in contradiction to the account given by Hesiod himself in which the gift was a laurel staff.]]\n\nSome scholars have seen Perses as a literary creation, a foil for the moralizing that Hesiod develops in ''Works and Days'', but there are also arguments against that theory.<ref>Hugh G. Evelyn-White, ''Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica'' (= [[Loeb Classical Library]], vol. 57), Harvard University Press (1964), p. xiv f.</ref> For example, it is quite common for works of moral instruction to have an imaginative setting, as a means of getting the audience's attention,<ref group=\"nb\">Jasper Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press (1986), cites for example the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], a Sumerian text in the form of a father's remonstrance with a prodigal son, and Egyptian wisdom texts spoken by viziers, etc. Hesiod was certainly open to oriental influences, as is clear in the myths presented by him in ''Theogony''.</ref> but it could be difficult to see how Hesiod could have travelled around the countryside entertaining people with a narrative about himself if the account was known to be fictitious.<ref>Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', p. 95.</ref> [[Gregory Nagy]], on the other hand, sees both ''P\u00e9rs\u0113s'' (\"the destroyer\" from {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03c9}}, ''p\u00e9rth\u014d'') and ''H\u0113s\u00edodos'' (\"he who emits the voice\" from {{lang|grc|\u1f35\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9}}, ''h\u00ed\u0113mi'' and {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f50\u03b4\u03ae}}, ''aud\u1e17'') as fictitious names for poetical [[persona]]e.<ref>Gregory Nagy, ''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', Cornell (1990), pp. 36\u201382.</ref> \n\nIt might seem unusual that Hesiod's father migrated from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, the opposite direction to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to [[Cumae]] in [[Campania]] (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west had something to do with that, since [[Euboea]] is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family.<ref>Barron and Easterling, 'Hesiod' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', p. 93.</ref> The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.<ref name=\"Burn, 77\">A. R. Burn, ''The Pelican History of Greece'', Penguin (1966), p. 77.</ref>\n\nIn spite of Hesiod's complaints about poverty, life on his father's farm could not have been too uncomfortable if ''Works and Days'' is anything to judge by, since he describes the routines of prosperous [[yeoman]]ry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (''Works and Days'' 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441\u20136), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.).<ref>Barron and Easterling, 'Hesiod' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', p. 93 f.</ref> One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in ''Theogony'' (337\u201345), listening to his father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 41 f.</ref> The father probably spoke in the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolian dialect]] of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are no words that are certainly Boeotian. His basic language was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]].<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 90 f.</ref>\n\nIt is probable that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as [[rhapsode]]s did\u2014otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] asserted that [[Boeotia]]ns showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the ''Works'' were engraved.<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D31%3Asection%3D4 IX, 31.4].</ref> If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps as an aid to memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', pp. 40 f., 47 f.</ref> Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.<ref name=\"Burn, 77\"/>\n\nThe personality behind the poems is unsuited to the kind of \"aristocratic withdrawal\" typical of a rhapsode but is instead \"argumentative, suspicious, ironically humorous, frugal, fond of proverbs, wary of women.\"<ref>Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', p. 88.</ref> He was in fact a misogynist of the same calibre as the later poet [[Semonides]].<ref>Barron and Easterling, 'Hesiod' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', p. 99.</ref> He resembles [[Solon]] in his preoccupation with issues of good versus evil and \"how a just and all-powerful god can allow the unjust to flourish in this life\". He recalls [[Aristophanes]] in his rejection of the idealised hero of epic literature in favour of an idealised view of the farmer.<ref>Andrewes, ''Greek Society'', pp. 218 f., 262.</ref> Yet the fact that he could eulogise kings in ''Theogony'' (80 ff., 430, 434) and denounce them as corrupt in ''Works and Days'' suggests that he could resemble whichever audience he composed for.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 44.</ref>\n\nVarious legends accumulated about Hesiod and they are recorded in several sources: \n*the story about the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'';<ref>Translated in Evelyn-White, ''Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica'', pp. 565\u2013597.</ref>\n*a ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Hesiod by the Byzantine grammarian [[John Tzetzes]];\n*the entry for Hesiod in the ''[[Suda]]'';\n*two passages and some scattered remarks in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (IX, 31.3\u20136 and 38.3 f.);\n*a passage in [[Plutarch]] ''Moralia'' (162b).\n\nTwo different\u2014yet early\u2014traditions record the site of Hesiod's grave. One, as early as [[Thucydides]], reported in Plutarch, the ''[[Suda]]'' and [[John Tzetzes]], states that the [[Delphic oracle]] warned Hesiod that he would die in [[Nemea]], and so he fled to [[Locris]], where he was killed at the local temple to Nemean Zeus, and buried there. This tradition follows a familiar [[Irony|ironic]] convention: the oracle that predicts accurately after all. The other tradition, first mentioned in an [[epigram]] by [[Chersias|Chersias of Orchomenus]] written in the 7th century BC (within a century or so of Hesiod's death) claims that Hesiod lies buried at [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], a town in Boeotia. According to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Constitution of Orchomenus,'' when the [[Thespiae|Thespian]]s ravaged Ascra, the villagers sought refuge at Orchomenus, where, following the advice of an oracle, they collected the ashes of Hesiod and set them in a place of honour in their ''[[agora]]'', next to the tomb of [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]], their eponymous founder. Eventually they came to regard Hesiod too as their \"hearth-founder\" ({{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, ''oikist\u0113s''). Later writers attempted to harmonize these two accounts.\n\n=== Dating<!--linked from the 'Life' section above--> ===\n[[File:Helikonmountainascent.JPG|thumb|right|Modern Mount Helicon. Hesiod once described his nearby hometown, [[Ascra]], as \"cruel in winter, hard in summer, never pleasant.\"]]\n\nGreeks in the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC considered their oldest poets to be [[Orpheus]], [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], Hesiod and [[Homer]]\u2014in that order. Thereafter, Greek writers began to consider Homer earlier than Hesiod. Devotees of Orpheus and Musaeus were probably responsible for  precedence being given to their two cult heroes and maybe the [[Homeridae]] were responsible in later antiquity for promoting Homer at Hesiod's expense.\n\nThe first known writers to locate Homer earlier than Hesiod were [[Xenophanes]] and [[Heraclides Ponticus]], though [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] was the first actually to argue the case. [[Ephorus]] made Homer a younger cousin of Hesiod, the 5th century BC historian [[Herodotus]]  (''Histories'' II, 53) evidently considered them near-contemporaries, and the 4th century BC [[sophist]] [[Alcidamas]] in his work ''Mouseion'' even brought them together for an imagined poetic ''[[Agon|\u00e1g\u014dn]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd}}), which survives today as the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]''. Most scholars today agree with Homer's priority but there are good arguments on either side.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', pp. 40, 47.</ref>\n\nHesiod certainly predates the [[Greek lyric|lyric]] and [[elegiac]] poets whose work has come down to the modern era.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Imitations of his work have been observed in [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], [[Epimenides]], [[Mimnermus]], [[Semonides]], [[Tyrtaeus]] and [[Archilochus]], from which it has been inferred that the latest possible date for him is about 650 BC.\n\nAn upper limit of 750 BC is indicated by a number of considerations, such as the probability that his work was written down, the fact that he mentions a sanctuary at [[Delphi]] that was of little national significance before c. 750 BC (''Theogony'' 499), and that he lists rivers that flow into the [[Euxine]], a region explored and developed by Greek colonists beginning in the 8th century BC. (''Theogony'' 337\u201345).<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 40 ff.</ref>\n\nHesiod mentions a poetry contest at [[Chalcis]] in [[Euboea]] where the sons of one [[Amphidamas]] awarded him a tripod (''Works and Days'' 654\u2013662). [[Plutarch]] identified this Amphidamas with the hero of the [[Lelantine War]] between Chalcis and [[Eretria]] and he concluded that the passage must be an interpolation into Hesiod's original work, assuming that the Lelantine War was too late for Hesiod. Modern scholars have accepted his identification of Amphidamas but disagreed with his conclusion. The date of the war is not known precisely but estimates placing it around 730\u2013705 BC, fit the estimated chronology for Hesiod. In that case, the tripod that Hesiod won might have been awarded for his rendition of ''Theogony'', a poem that seems to presuppose the kind of aristocratic audience he would have met at Chalcis.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 43 ff.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Hesiodi Ascraei quaecumque exstant.tif|thumb|[[Vignette (graphic design)|Vignette]] for ''Hesiodi Ascraei quaecumque exstant'' (1701)]]\n\nThree works have survived which are attributed to Hesiod by ancient commentators: ''[[Works and Days]]'', ''[[Theogony]]'', and ''[[Shield of Heracles]]''. Other works attributed to him are only found now in fragments. The surviving works and fragments were all written in the conventional metre and language of epic. However, the ''Shield of Heracles'' is now known to be spurious and probably was written in the sixth century BC. Many ancient critics also rejected ''Theogony'' (e.g., [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 9.31.3), even though Hesiod mentions himself by name in that poem. ''Theogony'' and  ''Works and Days'' might be very different in subject matter, but they share a distinctive language, metre, and prosody that subtly distinguish them from Homer's work and from the ''Shield of Heracles''<ref>Barron and Easterling, ''Hesiod'' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', p. 94.</ref> (see [[Hesiod#Hesiod's Greek|Hesiod's Greek]] below). Moreover, they both refer to the same version of the Prometheus myth.<ref>Vernant, J., ''Myth and Society in Ancient Greece'', tr. J. Lloyd (1980), p. 184 f.</ref> Yet even these authentic poems may include interpolations.  For example, the first ten verses of the ''Works and Days'' may have been borrowed from an Orphic hymn to Zeus (they were recognised as not the work of Hesiod by critics as ancient as Pausanias).<ref>J. A. Symonds, ''Studies of the Greek Poets'', p. 167.</ref>\n \nSome scholars have detected a proto-historical perspective in Hesiod, a view rejected by [[Paul Cartledge]], for example, on the grounds that Hesiod advocates a not-forgetting without any attempt at verification.<ref>[[Paul Cartledge]], ''Sparta and Lakonia \u2013 A regional history 1300 to 362 BC''. 2nd Edition.</ref> Hesiod has also been considered the father of [[gnomic verse]].<ref>Symonds, ''Studies of the Greek Poets'', p. 166.</ref> He had \"a passion for systematizing and explaining things\".<ref name=\"Burn, 77\"/> [[Ancient Greek poetry]] in general had strong philosophical tendencies and Hesiod, like Homer, demonstrates a deep interest in a wide range of 'philosophical' issues, from the nature of divine justice to the beginnings of human society. Aristotle (''Metaphysics'' 983b\u2013987a) believed that the question of first causes may even have started with Hesiod (''Theogony'' 116\u201353) and Homer (''Iliad'' 14.201, 246).<ref>W. Allen, ''Tragedy and the Early Greek Philosophical Tradition'', p. 72.</ref>\n\nHe viewed the world from outside the charmed circle of aristocratic rulers, protesting against their injustices in a tone of voice that has been described as having a \"grumpy quality redeemed by a gaunt dignity\"<ref>Andrewes, ''Greek Society'', p. 218.</ref> but, as stated in the biography section, he could also change to suit the audience. This ambivalence appears to underlie his presentation of human history in ''Works and Days'', where he depicts  a golden period when life was easy and good, followed by a steady decline in behaviour and happiness through the silver, bronze, and Iron Ages&nbsp;\u2013 except that he inserts a heroic age between the last two, representing its warlike men as better than their bronze predecessors. He seems in this case to be catering to two different world-views, one epic and aristocratic, the other unsympathetic to the heroic traditions of the aristocracy.<ref>Burn, ''The Pelican History of Greece'', p. 78.</ref>\n\n===''Theogony''===\n{{Main|Theogony}}\nThe ''Theogony'' is commonly considered Hesiod's earliest work. Despite the different subject matter between this poem and the ''Works and Days'', most scholars, with some notable exceptions, believe that the two works were written by the same man. As [[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West]] writes, \"Both bear the marks of a distinct personality: a surly, conservative countryman, given to reflection, no lover of women or life, who felt the gods' presence heavy about him.\"<ref>M. L. West, \"Hesiod\" in ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', S. Hornblower & A. Spawforth (eds), third revised edition, Oxford (1996), p. 521.</ref>\n\nThe ''Theogony'' concerns the origins of the world ([[cosmogony]]) and of the gods ([[theogony]]), beginning with [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Tartarus]] and [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], and shows a special interest in [[genealogy]]. Embedded in [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], there remain fragments of quite variant tales, hinting at the rich variety of myth that once existed, city by city; but Hesiod's retelling of the old stories became, according to [[Herodotus]], the accepted version that linked all [[Greeks|Hellenes]].\n\nThe creation myth in Hesiod has long been held to have Eastern influences, such as the [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Song of Kumarbi]] and the [[Babylon]]ian [[Enuma Elis]]. This cultural crossover would have occurred in the eighth and ninth century Greek trading colonies such as [[Al Mina]] in North Syria. (For more discussion, read Robin Lane Fox's ''Travelling Heroes'' and Walcot's ''Hesiod and the Near East.'')\n\n===''Works and Days''===\n{{Main|Works and Days}}\n[[File:Houghton MS Gr 20 - Theogeny, 10.jpg|thumb|Opening lines of ''Works and Days'' in a 16th-century manuscript]]\nThe ''Works and Days'' is a poem of over 800 lines which revolves around two general truths: labour is the universal lot of Man, but he who is willing to work will get by. Scholars have interpreted this work against a background of agrarian crisis in mainland [[Greece]], which inspired a wave of documented [[Greek colonies|colonisation]]s in search of new land.  This poem is one of the earliest known musings on economic thought.\n\nThis work lays out the five [[Ages of Man]], as well as containing advice and wisdom, prescribing a life of honest labour and attacking idleness and unjust [[judge]]s (like those who decided in favour of [[Perses (brother of Hesiod)|Perses]]) as well as the practice of usury. It describes immortals who roam the earth watching over justice and injustice.<ref>Hesiod, ''Works and Days'' 250: \"Verily upon the earth are thrice ten thousand immortals of the host of [[Zeus]], guardians of mortal man. They watch both justice and injustice, robed in mist, roaming abroad upon the earth.\" (Compare Symonds, ''Studies of the Greek Poets'', p. 179.)</ref> The poem regards labor as the source of all good, in that both gods and men hate the idle, who resemble [[Drone (bee)|drones]] in a hive.<ref>''Works and Days'' 300: \"Both gods and men are angry with a man who lives idle, for in nature he is like the stingless drones who waste the labor of the [[bees]], eating without working.\"</ref>  In the horror of the triumph of violence over hard work and honor, verses describing the \"Golden Age\" present the social character and practice of [[vegetarianism|nonviolent diet]] through agriculture and fruit-culture as a higher path of  living sufficiently.<ref>Williams, Howard, [http://www.ivu.org/history/williams/hesiod.html ''The Ethics of Diet \u2013 A Catena''] (1883).</ref>\n\n===Other writings===\nIn addition to the ''Theogony'' and ''Works and Days'', numerous other poems were ascribed to Hesiod during antiquity. Modern scholarship has doubted their authenticity, and these works are generally referred to as forming part of the \"Hesiodic Corpus\" whether or not their authorship is accepted.<ref>E.g. {{harvtxt|Cingano|2009}}.</ref> The situation is summed up in this formulation by [[Glenn W. Most|Glenn Most]]:\n{{quote|\"Hesiod\" is the name of a person; \"Hesiodic\" is a designation for a kind of poetry, including but not limited to the poems of which the authorship may reasonably be assigned to Hesiod himself.<ref>{{harvtxt|Most|2006|p=xi}}.</ref>}}\nOf these works forming the extended Hesiodic corpus, only the ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03c3\u03c0\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f29\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2}}, ''Aspis H\u0113rakleous'') is transmitted intact via a medieval manuscript tradition.\n\nClassical authors also attributed to Hesiod a lengthy genealogical poem known as ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' or ''Ehoiai'' (because sections began with the Greek words ''\u0113 hoi\u0113,'' \"Or like the one who&nbsp;...\"). It was a mythological catalogue of the mortal women who had mated with gods, and of the offspring and descendants of these unions.\n\nSeveral additional hexameter poems were ascribed to Hesiod:\n* ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]'', a poem similar to the ''Catalogue of Women'', but presumably longer.\n* ''[[Wedding of Ceyx]]'', a poem concerning Heracles' attendance at the wedding of a certain Ceyx\u2014noted for its riddles.\n* ''[[Melampodia]]'', a genealogical poem that treats of the families of, and myths associated with, the great seers of mythology.\n* ''[[Idaean Dactyls (poem)|Idaean Dactyls]]'', a work concerning mythological smelters, the [[Dactyl (mythology)#Idaean Dactyls|Idaean Dactyls]].\n* ''[[Descent of Perithous]]'', about [[Theseus]] and [[Perithous]]' trip to Hades.\n* ''[[Precepts of Chiron]]'', a didactic work that presented the teaching of [[Chiron]] as delivered to the young [[Achilles]].\n* ''[[Megala Erga]]'' or ''Great Works'', a poem similar to the ''Works and Days'', but presumably longer\n* ''[[Astronomia]]'', an astronomical poem to which Callimachus (''Ep''. 27) apparently compared [[Aratus]]' ''Phaenomena''.\n* ''[[Aegimius (poem)|Aegimius]]'', a heroic epic concerning the Dorian [[Aegimius]] (variously attributed to Hesiod or [[Cercops of Miletus]]).\n* ''[[Kiln (poem)|Kiln]]'' or ''Potters'', a brief poem asking Athena to aid potters if they pay the poet. Also attributed to Homer.\n* ''Ornithomantia'', a work on bird omens that followed the ''Works and Days''.\n\nIn addition to these works, the ''Suda'' lists an otherwise unknown \"dirge for Batrachus, [Hesiod's] beloved\".<ref>''Suda'', s.v.

It has been identified by [[Gisela Richter]] as an imagined portrait of Hesiod.  In fact, it has been recognized since 1813 that the bust was not of Seneca, when an inscribed [[herma]] portrait of Seneca with quite different features was discovered. Most scholars now follow Richter's  identification.<ref group=\"nb\">Gisela Richter, ''The Portraits of the Greeks''. London: Phaidon (1965), I, p. 58 ff.; commentators agreeing with Richter include Wolfram Prinz, \"The Four Philosophers by Rubens and the Pseudo-Seneca in Seventeenth-Century Painting\" in ''The Art Bulletin'' '''55'''.3 (September 1973), pp. 410\u2013428. \"[\u2026] one feels that it may just as well have been the Greek writer Hesiod [\u2026]\" and Martin Robertson, in his review of G.

Comparisons with Homer, a native Ionian, can be unflattering. Hesiod's handling of the dactylic hexameter  was not as masterful or fluent as Homer's and one modern scholar refers to his \"hobnailed hexameters\".<ref>Griffin, ''Greek Myth and Hesiod'', p. 88, quoting M. L. West.</ref> His use of language and meter in ''Works and Days'' and ''Theogony'' distinguishes him also from the author of the ''Shield of Heracles''. All three poets, for example, employed [[digamma]] inconsistently, sometimes allowing it to affect syllable length and meter, sometimes not. The ratio of observance/neglect of digamma varies between them. The extent of variation depends on how the evidence is collected and interpreted but there is a clear trend, revealed for example in the following set of statistics.\n:''Theogony'' 2.5/1\n:''Works and Days'' 1.5/1\n: ''Shield'' 5.9/1\n: Homer 5.4/1<ref group=\"nb\">Statistics for the three 'Hesiodic' poems taken from A. V. Paues, ''De Digammo Hesiodeo Quaestiones'' (Stockholm 1897), and stats for Homer from Hartel, ''Sitzungs-Bericht der Wiener Akademie'' 78 (1874), both cited by M. L. West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 99.</ref>\nHesiod does not observe digamma as often as the others do. That result is a bit counter-intuitive since digamma was still a feature of the Boeotian dialect that Hesiod probably spoke, whereas it had already vanished from the Ionic vernacular of Homer. This anomaly can be explained by the fact that Hesiod made a conscious effort to compose like an Ionian epic poet  at a time when digamma was not heard in Ionian speech, while Homer tried to compose like an older generation of Ionian bards, when it was heard in Ionian speech. There is also a significant difference in the results for  ''Theogony'' and ''Works and Days'', but that is merely due to the fact that the former includes a catalog of divinities and therefore it makes frequent use of the definite article associated with digamma, o\u1f31.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', pp. 91, 99.</ref>\n\nThough typical of epic, his vocabulary features some significant differences from Homer's. One scholar has counted 278 un-Homeric words in ''Works and Days'', 151 in ''Theogony'' and 95 in ''Shield of Heracles''. The disproportionate number of un-Homeric words in ''W & D'' is due to its un-Homeric subject matter.<ref group=\"nb\">The count of un-Homeric words is by H.K. Fietkau, ''De carminum hesiodeorum atque hymnorum quattuor magnorum vocabulis non homericis'' (K\u00f6nigsberg, 1866), cited by M. L. West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 77.</ref> Hesiod's vocabulary also includes quite a lot of formulaic phrases that are not found in Homer, which indicates that he may have been writing within a different tradition.<ref>West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', p. 78.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\"/>\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Allen, T.

These systems were inherited from usage in the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called [[Samaria ostraca]] and sometimes known as ''Hebrew-Aramaic numerals'', ultimately derived from the Egyptian [[Hieratic numerals]].\n\nThe Greek system was adopted in [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC.\n<ref> Stephen Chrisomalis, ''Numerical Notation: A Comparative History'', Cambridge University Press, 2010,\n[https://books.google.ch/books?id=ux--OWgWvBQC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 157]; Solomon Gandz, ''Hebrew Numerals'',  Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research\nVol. 4, (1932 - 1933), pp. 53-112.</ref>\n\nIn this system, there is no notation for [[0 (number)|zero]], and the numeric values for individual letters are added together.  Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. [[Gematria]] (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively.\n\nIn [[Israel]] today, the decimal system of [[Arabic numerals]] (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the [[civil calendar]]).  The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the [[Hebrew calendar]], or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as [[Roman numerals]] are used in the West.\n\n==Numbers==\nThe Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. [[Cardinal numbers|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal numbers]] must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender.\n\n[[File:Hohe Synagoge Prag 1.jpg|thumb|260px| The lower clock on the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall]] building in [[Prague]], with Hebrew numerals in counterclockwise order.]]\n[[File:Pocket watches with Hebrew numerals.JPG|thumb|260px|Early 20th century pocket watches with Hebrew numerals in clockwise order ([[Jewish Museum, Berlin]]).]]\n\n===Ordinal values===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]]<br><small>(English)</small>\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]]<br><small>(Hebrew)</small>\n|-\n!

Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the [[long scale]]; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified [[short scale]] (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.<ref>[http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/\u05d4\u05d0\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4-\u05dc\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df-\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea-\u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05d4-\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4-\u05d4-32/ http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/\u05d4\u05d0\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05d4-\u05dc\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df-\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea-\u05d4\u05ea\u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05d4-\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4-\u05d4-32/]</ref>\n\n===Speaking and writing===\nCardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., ''shlosha yeladim''), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., ''yeled echad''). The number two is special: ''shnayim'' (m.) and ''shtayim'' (f.) become ''shney'' (m.) and ''shtey'' (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For [[ordinal number]]s (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.\n\n==Calculations==\nThe Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total.  For example, 177 is represented as \u05e7\u05e2\u05d6 which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177.\n\nMathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900).  In practice the last letter, ''tav'' (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from ''kof'' (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above.  Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 ''sofit'' (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.<ref>According to Gandz (p. 96), cited above, this use of the sofit letters was not widely accepted and soon abandoned.</ref>\n\n===Key exceptions===\nBy convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as \u05d8\u05f4\u05d5{{lrm}} (9 + 6) and \u05d8\u05f4\u05d6{{lrm}} (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations \u05d9-\u05d4{{lrm}} (10 + 5) and \u05d9-\u05d5{{lrm}} (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every [[full moon]], since all Hebrew months start on a [[new moon]] (see for example: [[Tu BiShvat]]).\n\nCombinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as \u05ea\u05e9\u05de\u05f4\u05d3{{lrm}} (meaning \"you/it will be destroyed\") might instead be written as \u05ea\u05e9\u05d3\u05f4\u05de or \u05ea\u05de\u05e9\u05f4\u05d3 (meaning \"end to demon\").\n\n===Use of final letters===\nThe Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms\u2014\u05da (500&lrm;), \u05dd (600&lrm;), \u05df (700&lrm;), \u05e3 (800&lrm;) and \u05e5 (900&lrm;)\u2014which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900.\n\nThe ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are: \u05ea\u05f4\u05e7 (500&lrm;), \u05ea\u05f4\u05e8 (600&lrm;), \u05ea\u05f4\u05e9 (700&lrm;), \u05ea\u05f4\u05ea (800&lrm;) and \u05ea\u05ea\u05f4\u05e7 (900&lrm;).\n\n==Gershayim==\n[[File:Baiersdorf Juedischer Friedhof 025 (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|A tombstone from 1935 in [[Baiersdorf]], [[Germany]], reading:\n<poem style=\"text-align:center\">\u05e0\u05e4\u05d8\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd '''\u05db\u05c4''' \u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\n\u05d5\u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd '''\u05db\u05c4\u05d2\u05c4''' \u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\n\u05e9\u05e0\u05ea '''\u05ea\u05c4\u05e8\u05c4\u05e6\u05c4\u05d4\u05c4''' \u05dc\u05e4\u05c4\u05e7</poem>\nIn English:\n''<poem style=\"text-align:center\">Passed away on day '''20''' Iyar\nAnd buried on day '''23''' Iyar\nYear '''695''' without the thousands [i.e. year 5695]</poem>''\nNote the dots above each letter in each number.]]\n[[Gershayim]] (U+05F4 in [[Unicode]], and resembling a [[double quote]] mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as ''merkha'ot'', which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (''e.g.,'' 28 \u2192 \u05db\u05f4\u05d7{{lrm}}).\n\nSimilarly, a single [[Geresh]] (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a [[single quote]] mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (''e.g.,'' 100 \u2192 \u05e7\u05f3{{lrm}}).\n\nNote that [[Geresh]] and [[Gershayim]] merely indicate \"''not a (normal) word.''\" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as \"''[[Hebrew abbreviations|abbreviation]]''\").\n\nAn alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number.\n\n==Decimals==\nIn print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes.  Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the [[Hebrew calendar]]; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''etc.'', in English); and in numerology ([[gematria]]).\n\n==Thousands and date formats==\nThousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the ''right'', since Hebrew is read from right to left).  There are no special marks to signify that the \u201ccount\u201d is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter.

According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''H\u0113r\u014ds'' \"is akin to\" the Latin ''seru\u0101re,'' meaning ''to safeguard''.

Thus Heracles's name means \"the glory of [[Hera]]\", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.\n\n[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.<ref name=\":1\" /> The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield.

It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.<ref>Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936</ref>\n\nThe concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical \"hero's [[quest]]\" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].<ref name=\":0\">Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}</ref> One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: \"The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes \"It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles.\"<ref>[[Joseph Campbell]].

A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers.

[[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.\n\nExplicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in \"[[class struggle]]s\", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: \"You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.\"<ref name=Spencer>Spencer, Herbert.

The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.\nActs of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.\nIf their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| last = Cassagnes Brouquet\n| first = Sophie\n| authorlink =\n| last2 = Dubesset\n| first2 = Mathilde\n| author2link =\n| title = La fabrique des h\u00e9ro\u00efnes\n| journal = Clio.

One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.\n\nIn the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's \"[[immortality]] project\" (or \"''[[causa sui]]'' project\"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional \"hero-systems\", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing \"illusions\" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Action hero]]\n** [[List of female action heroes]]\n* [[Antihero]]\n* [[Byronic hero]]\n* [[Carnegie Hero Fund]]\n* [[Culture hero]]\n* [[Folk hero]]\n* [[Germanic hero]]\n* [[Hero and Leander]]\n* [[Hero of Labour]]\n* [[Heroic fantasy]]\n* [[List of genres]]\n* [[Randian hero]]\n* [[Reluctant hero]]\n* [[Romantic hero]]\n* [[Space opera]]\n* [[Tragic hero]]\n* [[Youxia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allison | first = Scott\n | authorlink = Scott Allison\n | title = Heroes: What They Do and Why We Need Them\n | location = [[Richmond, Virginia]]\n | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n | year = 2010\n}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Andrew|title=British-Canadian Centennium, 1759\u20131859: General James Wolfe, His Life and Death: A Lecture Delivered in the Mechanics' Institute Hall, Montreal, on Tuesday, September 13, 1859, being the Anniversary Day of the Battle of Quebec, fought a Century before in which Britain lost a Hero and Won a Province|publisher=J.

A consequence of this is that concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide have high [[viscosity]] due to the formation of an extended network of hydrogen bonds as in [[hydrogen fluoride]] solutions.\n\nIn solution, exposed to air, the hydroxide ion reacts rapidly with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], acting as an acid, to form, initially, the [[bicarbonate]] ion.\n:OH<sup>\u2212</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> {{eqm}} {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}\nThe [[equilibrium constant]] for this reaction can be specified either as a reaction with dissolved carbon dioxide or as a reaction with carbon dioxide gas (see [[Carbonic acid]] for values and details). At neutral or acid pH, the reaction is slow, but is catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase]], which effectively creates hydroxide ions at the active site.\n\nSolutions containing the hydroxide ion attack [[glass]]. In this case, the [[silicate]]s in glass are acting as acids. Basic hydroxides, whether solids or in solution, are stored in [[airtight]] plastic containers.\n\nThe hydroxide ion can function as a typical electron-pair donor [[ligand]], forming such complexes as tetrahydroxoaluminate/tetrahydroxido[[aluminate]] [Al(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>. It is also often found in mixed-ligand complexes of the type [ML<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>''y''</sub>]<sup>''z''+</sup>, where L is a ligand. The hydroxide ion often serves as a [[bridging ligand]], donating one pair of electrons to each of the atoms being bridged. As illustrated by [Pb<sub>2</sub>(OH)]<sup>3+</sup>, metal hydroxides are often written in a simplified format. It can even act as a 3-electron-pair donor, as in the tetramer [PtMe<sub>3</sub>(OH)]<sub>4</sub>.<ref>Greenwood, p.&nbsp;1168</ref>\n\nWhen bound to a strongly electron-withdrawing metal centre, hydroxide ligands tend to [[dissociation (chemistry)|ionise]] into oxide ligands.

A water molecule has an HOH bending mode at about 1600&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, so the absence of this band can be used to distinguish an OH group from a water molecule.\n\nWhen the OH group is bound to a metal ion in a [[coordination complex]], an M\u2212OH<!-- WP:MOSCHEM#Skeletal_formulas --> bending mode can be observed.

For most of his career, Giger had worked predominantly in [[airbrush]], creating monochromatic canvasses depicting surreal, [[nightmare|nightmarish]] dreamscapes. He also worked with pastels, markers and ink.<ref name=\"Arh+\"\n\nGiger's most distinctive stylistic innovation was that of a representation of human bodies and machines in a cold, [[cyborg|interconnected relationship]], he described as \"biomechanical\". His main influences were painters [[Dado (painter)|Dado]],<ref>http://www.hrgiger.com/museum/introduction.htm</ref> [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. He met Salvador Dal\u00ed, to whom he was introduced by painter [[Robert Venosa]].

One \"[[Giger Bar]]\" appeared in Tokyo, but the realization of his designs was a great disappointment to him, since the Japanese organization behind the venture did not wait for his final designs, and instead used Giger's rough preliminary sketches. For that reason Giger disowned the Tokyo bar.<ref name=\"cnet\">Cheers to the aliens: Sci-Fi Hotel, Giger Bar coming to US?\nSci-Fi Hotel founder Andy Davies teams up with \"Alien\" artist H.R.

Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and de las Casas both recorded that the island was called ''Quizqueia'' (supposedly \"Mother of all Lands\") by the Ta\u00edno. D'Anghiera added another name, ''Haiti'' (\"Mountainous Land\"), but later research shows that the word does not seem to derive from the original [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] Ta\u00edno language.<ref name=\"anghiera\">{{cite book| last = Angler\u00eda| first =  Pedro M\u00e1rtir de| title = D\u00e9cadas del Nuevo Mundo, Tercera D\u00e9cada, Libro&nbsp;VII| publisher = Editorial Bajel| year = 1949| location = Buenos Aires| language = Spanish }}</ref> (''Quisqueya'' is today mostly used in the [[Dominican Republic]].)

In 1606, the government of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action meant that French, English and Dutch pirates established their own bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.\n\n[[File:Map of Hispaniola.JPG|thumb|300px|French map of Hispaniola by Nicolas de Fer]]\nIn 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by [[Louis XIV|King Louis&nbsp;XIV]].

Nicknamed the \"Pearl of the Antilles,\" it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the [[West Indies]], with a system of human enslavement used to grow and harvest sugar cane, during a time when demand for sugar was high in Europe. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized at the expense of human lives. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe.\n\nWith the treaty of [[Peace of Basel]], revolutionary France emerged as a major European power. In the second 1795 Treaty of Basel (July 22), Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic.

France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo. In 1805, Haitian troops of General [[Henri Christophe]] tried to conquer all of Hispaniola. They invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and Moca, killing most of their residents, but news of a French fleet sailing towards Haiti forced General Christophe to return to Haiti, leaving the eastern Spanish side of the island in French hands. In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the [[Criollo people|criollos]] of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of the United Kingdom (Spain's ally) returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control.\n\nFearing the influence of a society that had successfully fought and won against their enslavers, the United States and European powers refused to recognize Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere. France demanded a high payment for compensation to slaveholders who lost their property, and Haiti was saddled with unmanageable debt for decades.<ref name=\"natural\">Diamond, Jared M. and Robinson, James A.

For this he accepted harsh conditions. The Prussian Ministry of Health insisted after the 1890 scandal with [[tuberculin]], which Koch had discovered and intended as a remedy for tuberculosis, that any of Koch's inventions would unconditionally belong to the government and he would not be compensated.

Thus they grow, for example, on a gelatinous mass prepared with [[agar-agar]], which remains solid at blood temperature, and which has received a supplement of meat [[broth]] and [[peptone]].) }}</ref>\n\n====Koch's four postulates====\n{{Main|Koch's postulates}}\nDuring his time as government advisor, Koch published a report, in which he stated the importance of pure cultures in isolating disease-causing organisms and explained the necessary steps to obtain these cultures, methods which are summarized in [[Koch's postulates|Koch\u2019s four postulates]].<ref name=\"Bacteriology, historical\">Amsterdamska, Olga. \"Bacteriology, Historical.\" ''International Encyclopedia of Public Health.'' 2008. Web.</ref> Koch\u2019s discovery of the causative agent of anthrax led to the formation of a generic set of [[wikt:postulate|postulates]] which can be used in the determination of the cause of most infectious diseases.<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\"/> These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents, are listed here:<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\"/>\n# The organism must always be present, in every case of the disease.\n# The organism must be isolated from a host containing the disease and grown in pure culture.\n# Samples of the organism taken from pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible animal in the laboratory.\n# The organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal and must be identified as the same original organism first isolated from the originally diseased host.\n\n====Anthrax====\nRobert Koch is widely known for his work with [[anthrax]], discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\" /> He discovered the formation of [[bacterial spore|spores]] in anthrax bacteria, which could remain dormant under specific conditions.<ref name=\"Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch\" /> However, under optimal conditions, the spores were activated and caused disease.<ref name=\"Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch\" /> To determine this causative agent, he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides, used dyes to stain the cultures, and observed them through a microscope.<ref name=\"Robert Koch\" /> His work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease, rejecting the idea of [[spontaneous generation]] and supporting the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref name=\"Germ theory of disease\">\"Germ theory of disease.\" ''World of Microbiology and Immunology.''

On page 191, he mentions the characteristic comma shape of ''Vibrio cholerae'':  ''\"{{lang|de|Im letzten Berichte konnte ich bereits gehorsamst mittheilen, dass an den Bacillen des Choleradarms besondere Eigenschaften aufgefunden wurden, durch welche sie mit aller Sicherheit von anderen Bakterien zu unterscheiden sind.

Of these features, the following are the most characteristic: the bacteria are not quite straight, like the rest of the bacilli, but a little bent, similar to a comma.)</ref> The bacterium had originally been isolated in 1854 by Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]],<ref>See:\n*  Fillipo Pacini (1854) {{lang|it|2=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xdtQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA397#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Osservazioni microscopiche e deduzioni patologiche sul cholera asiatico\"]}} (Microscopic observations and pathological deductions on Asiatic cholera), ''{{lang|it|Gazzetta Medica Italiana:  Toscana}}'', 2nd series, '''4'''(50):397\u2013401; '''4'''(51):405\u201312.\n*  Reprinted (more legibly) as a [https://books.google.com/books?id=F9s_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1 pamphlet.]</ref> but its exact nature and his results were not widely known.\n\n====Acquired immunity====\nKoch observed the phenomenon of acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. On December 26, 1900, he arrived as part of an expedition to [[German New Guinea]], which was then a protectorate of the German Reich. Koch serially examined the [[Papuan people]], the indigenous inhabitants, and their blood samples and noticed they contained [[Plasmodium]] parasites, the cause of [[malaria]], but their bouts of malaria were mild or could not even be noticed, i.e. were [[subclinical]]. On the contrary, German settlers and Chinese workers, who had been brought to New Guinea, fell sick immediately. The longer they had stayed in the country, however, the more they too seemed to develop a resistance against it.<ref>{{lang|de|Hugo Kronecker: Hygienische Topographie}} In: A.

More specifically, it refers to a specified [[volume]], measured in either [[Imperial unit|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US customary]] measures, primarily applied to [[alcoholic beverage]]s, such as [[wine]], [[ale]], or [[cider]].\n\nA '''tobacco hogshead''' was used in British and American colonial times to transport and store tobacco. It was a very large wooden barrel. A standardized hogshead measured {{convert|48|in|mm|0}} long and {{convert|30|in|mm|0}} in diameter at the head (at least {{convert|550|L|impgal USgal|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, depending on the width in the middle). Fully packed with tobacco, it weighed about {{convert|1000|lb|kg|0}}.\n\nA '''wine hogshead''' contains about {{convert|300|L|impgal USgal|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>http://www.apjohn.com.au/Upload/PrintPages/AP%20John_Technical_Specifications.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) notes that the hogshead was first standardized by an [[act of Parliament]] in 1423, though the standards continued to vary by locality and content.  For example, the OED cites an 1897 edition of ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', which specified the number of gallons of wine in a hogshead varying by type of wine: [[claret]]  (presumably) {{convert|46|impgal|USgal L|0}},  [[Port wine|port]] {{convert|57|impgal|USgal L|0}}, [[sherry]] {{convert|54|impgal|USgal L|0}}; and [[Madeira wine|Madeira]] {{convert|46|impgal|USgal L|0}}. The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' claims that a hogshead can consist of anything from (presumably) {{convert|62.5|to|140|USgal|impgal L|0}}.\n\nEventually, a hogshead of [[wine]] came to be {{convert|63|USgal|impgal L|1|lk=on}}, while a hogshead of [[beer]] or [[ale]] is 64 gallons (250 L if old beer/ale gallons, 245 L if imperial).\n\nA hogshead was also used as unit of measurement for sugar in [[Louisiana]] for most of the 19th century. [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]]s were listed in sugar schedules as having produced ''x'' number of hogsheads of sugar or molasses. A hogshead was also used for the measurement of [[herring]] fished for [[Sardine (food)|sardines]] in Blacks Harbour, [[New Brunswick]].\n\nThe etymology of hogshead is uncertain. According to English philologist Walter William Skeat (1835\u20131912), the origin is to be found in the name for a cask or liquid measure appearing in various forms in several [[Germanic languages]], in Dutch oxhooft (modern okshoofd), Danish oxehoved, Old Swedish oxhufvod, etc. The word should therefore be \"oxhead\", \"hogshead\" being a mere corruption. It has been suggested that the name arose from the branding of such a measure with the head of an ox.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Hogshead |volume=13|page=507}}</ref>\n\n==Charts==\n{{English wine casks}}\n{{English brewery casks}}\n\nA hogshead of [[Madeira wine]] was approximately equal to 45\u201348 gallons (0.205\u20130.218) m<sup>3</sup>.\n\nA hogshead of [[brandy]] was approximately equal to 56\u201361 gallons (0.255\u20130.277) m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English units of wine casks]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Imperial units]]\n[[Category:Wine packaging and storage]]\n[[Category:Brewing]]\n[[Category:Units of volume]]\n[[Category:Containers]]\n[[Category:Alcohol measurement]]", "sha1": "6z0so135sl2g7c1lhzoc83545rm58e6"}}, {"title": "Huallaga", "ns": "0", "id": "13727", "revision": {"id": "682942096", "parentid": "540126263", "timestamp": "2015-09-27T02:25:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kethrus", "id": "22883165"}, "minor": "", "comment": "clean up using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Huallaga''' may refer to:\n\n*Locations in [[Peru]]:\n**'''[[Huallaga Province]]'''\n**'''[[Huallaga River]]'''\n**'''[[Huallaga Valley]]'''\n\n{{disambiguation}}\n\n{{Short pages monitor}}<!-- This long comment was added to the page to prevent it being listed on Special:Shortpages.

The year 1991 saw the introduction of the [[Honda NSX]] supercar, the first all-aluminum monocoque vehicle that incorporated a mid-engine V6 with variable-valve timing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1990thensx/text01/index.html|title=Let's Build a Sportscar!|publisher=Honda|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nCEO [[Tadashi Kume]] was succeeded by [[Nobuhiko Kawamoto]] in 1990. Kawamoto was selected over [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]], who oversaw the successful establishment of Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. in [[Marysville, Ohio]]. Irimajiri and Kawamoto shared a friendly rivalry within Honda; owing to health issues, Irimajiri would resign in 1992.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Soichiro Honda]] and the departure of Irimajiri, Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and [[sport utility vehicle]] boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in 1992 and 1993 that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by [[Mitsubishi Motors]], which at the time was a larger automaker by volume and was flush with profits from its successful [[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] and [[Mitsubishi Diamante|Diamante]] models.<ref name=Economist>{{cite news|title=The trouble with excellence|url=http://www.economist.com/node/140416|accessdate=5 April 2013 | work=The Economist|date=4 July 1998}}</ref>\n\nKawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing through market-driven product development that resulted in recreational vehicles such as the first-generation [[Honda Odyssey (international)#First generation (RA1-RA5 chassis) (1994\u20131999)|Odyssey]] and the [[Honda CR-V|CR-V]], and a refocusing away from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with the company's engineers but not with the buying public. The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended [[Honda in Formula One|the company's successful participation in Formula One]] after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally friendly company image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_n2_v178/ai_20301571/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708110836/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_n2_v178/ai_20301571/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |work=Automotive Industries |title=1998 executive of the year \u2013 Honda Motor Co. president Nobuhiko Kawamoto |first=Marjorie |last=Sorge |year=1998 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Honda Aircraft Company]] was established in 1995, as a wholly owned subsidiary; its goal was to produce jet aircraft under Honda's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gearheads.org/history-of-honda-motor-company/|title=The History of Honda Motor Company|date=18 May 2012|publisher=GearHeads|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 2015, Honda announced that CEO and President [[Takanobu Ito]] would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo by June; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/honda-names-takahiro-hachigo-new-president-1424674084|title=Honda Names Takahiro Hachigo New President; Replaces Takanobu Ito, who took over as chief executive in 2009|date=23 February 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate profile and divisions==\nHonda is headquartered in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], Tokyo, Japan.

A few examples are the latest [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]] [[minivan]] and the [[Honda Ridgeline|Ridgeline]], Honda's first light-duty uni-body [[pickup truck]]. Both were designed and engineered primarily in North America and are produced there. Other example of exclusive models includes the [[Honda Civic (eighth generation)#Europe|Honda Civic five-door hatchback]] sold in Europe.\n\nHonda's automotive manufacturing ambitions can be traced back to 1963, with the [[Honda T360]], a [[kei car]] truck built for the Japanese market.<ref name=tjra>{{cite journal | editor-first = Jonathan | editor-last = Barr | title = 1965 Honda T500F Flat Bed Utility | journal = The Japanese Restorer in Australia |date=July\u2013September 2003 | issue = 4 | location = Bald Hills, Queensland, Australia | page = 15 }}</ref> This was followed by the two-door [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], the [[Honda S500]] also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the [[Honda L700]]. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered [[Honda 1300]] in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the [[Honda N360]], another ''Kei car'' that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the [[Honda Life]] that was water-cooled.\n\nThe Honda Life represented Honda's efforts in competing in the ''kei'' car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The [[Honda Life#Life Step Van|Life StepVan]] had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, appears to be an influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.\n\nAs Honda entered into automobile manufacturing in the late 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993\u201397 Passport which was part of a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed [[front-wheel-drive]] powertrain implementation, which is currently a long-held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire to be the first to try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain [[Acura]], and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the [[Honda NSX]], which also introduced [[variable valve timing]] technology, Honda calls [[VTEC]].\n\nThe Civic is a line of [[compact car]]s developed and manufactured by Honda. In North America, the Civic is the second-longest continuously running nameplate from a Japanese manufacturer; only its perennial rival, the [[Toyota Corolla]], introduced in 1968, has been in production longer.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.toyota.com/about/our_business/our_history/product_history/pdf/corolla.pdf |title=Toyota Corolla History|work=Toyota Motor Corp}}</ref> The Civic, along with the Accord and [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]], comprised Honda's vehicles sold in North America until the 1990s, when the model lineup was expanded. Having gone through several generational changes, the Civic has become larger and more [[upmarket]], and it currently slots between the [[Honda Fit|Fit]] and Accord.\n\nHonda produces [[Honda Civic Hybrid|Civic hybrid]], a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] that competes with the [[Toyota Prius]], and also produces the [[Honda Insight|Insight]] and [[Honda CR-Z|CR-Z]].\n\nIn 2008, Honda increased global production to meet demand for [[small car]]s and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] in the U.S. and emerging markets.

[[1965 Formula One season|1965]] saw the addition of [[Richie Ginther]] to the team, who scored Honda's first point at the [[1965 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], and Honda's first win at the [[1965 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]]. [[1967 Formula One season|1967]] saw their next win at the [[1967 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] with [[John Surtees]] as their driver. In [[1968 Formula One season|1968]], [[Jo Schlesser]] was killed in a Honda RA302 at the [[1968 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]. This racing tragedy, coupled with their commercial difficulties selling automobiles in the United States, prompted Honda to withdraw from all international motorsport that year.\n\nAfter a learning year in 1965, Honda-powered [[Brabham]]s dominated the 1966 French [[Formula Two]] championship in the hands of [[Jack Brabham]] and [[Denny Hulme]]. As there was no European Championship that season, this was the top F2 championship that year. In the early 1980s Honda returned to F2, supplying engines to [[Ron Tauranac]]'s [[Ralt]] team. Tauranac had designed the Brabham cars for their earlier involvement. They were again extremely successful. In a related exercise, John Judd's [[Judd (engine)|Engine Developments]] company produced a turbo \"Brabham-Honda\" engine for use in [[open wheel car|IndyCar]] racing. It won only one race, in 1988 for [[Bobby Rahal]] at Pocono.\n\nHonda returned to Formula One in 1983, initially with another Formula Two partner, the [[Spirit (racing team)|Spirit]] team, before switching abruptly to Williams in 1984. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Honda powered cars won six consecutive [[Formula One]] Constructors Championships. [[WilliamsF1]] won the crown in [[1986 Formula One season|1986]] and [[1987 Formula One season|1987]]. Honda switched allegiance again in 1988. New partners [[McLaren]] won the title in [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], [[1989 Formula One season|1989]], [[1990 Formula One season|1990]] and [[1991 Formula One season|1991]]. Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 1992, although the related [[Mugen-Honda]] company maintained a presence up to the end of 1999, winning four races with [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix]].\n\nHonda debuted in the [[Champ Car|CART IndyCar World Series]] as a works supplier in 1994. The engines were far from competitive at first, but after development, the company powered six consecutive drivers championships. In 2003, Honda transferred its effort to the rival [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] [[IndyCar Series]] with [[Ilmor]] as joint development until 2006. In 2004, Honda-powered cars overwhelmingly dominated the IndyCar Series, winning 14 of 16 IndyCar races, including the [[Indianapolis 500]], and claimed the IndyCar Series Manufacturers' Championship, Drivers' Championship and Rookie of the Year titles. From 2006 to 2011, Honda was the lone engine supplier for the IndyCar Series, including the Indianapolis 500. In the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]], for the first time in Indianapolis 500 history, the race was run without a single engine problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing.honda.com/results/detail.aspx?date=2006_05_28 |title=Last Lap Victory for Franchitti Seals 2007 IndyCar Title |accessdate=14 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235757/http://racing.honda.com/results/detail.aspx?date=2006_05_28 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> Since 2012, [[Honda Performance Development|HPD]] has constructed turbocharged V-6 engines for its IndyCar effort.\n\nDuring 1998, Honda considered returning to Formula One with their own team. The project was aborted after the death of its technical director, [[Harvey Postlethwaite]]. Honda instead came back as an official engine supplier to [[British American Racing]] (BAR) and Jordan Grand Prix. Honda bought a stake in the BAR team in 2004 before buying the team outright at the end of 2005, becoming a constructor for the first time since the 1960s. Honda won the [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix]] with driver [[Jenson Button]].\n\nIt was announced on 5 December 2008, that Honda would be exiting Formula One with immediate effect due to the 2008 global economic crisis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72322|title=Honda confirm immediate F1 pull out |accessdate=5 December 2008 | work=Autosport|date=5 December 2008}}</ref> The team was sold to former team principal [[Ross Brawn]], renamed [[Brawn GP]] and subsequently [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns21227.html|title=Brawn GP arrives |accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nHonda became an official works team in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 2010.\n\nHonda made an official announcement on 16 May 2013 that it planned to re-enter into Formula One in 2015 as an engine supplier to [[McLaren]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Andrew|title=Formula 1: Honda to return in 2015 as McLaren engine supplier|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/22551204|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=16 May 2013}}</ref> On 15 September 2017, after a winless campaign spanning three seasons without yielding a single podium and achieving a best finish of fifth place, [[McLaren]] announced their divorce from Honda, with the latter going on to sign a multi-year deal to supply [[Toro Rosso]], the junior team of [[Red Bull Racing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Andrew|title=McLaren-Honda split after three years of troubled partnership|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/41248320|accessdate=15 September 2017|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Motorcycles===\n{{Main article|Honda Racing Corporation}}\n[[File:Dani Pedrosa 2010 Assen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Honda RC212V]] raced by [[Dani Pedrosa]]]]\n[[Honda Racing Corporation]] (HRC) was formed in 1982. The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high potential racing machines. Its racing activities are an important source for the creation of leading edge technologies used in the development of Honda motorcycles. HRC also contributes to the advancement of motorcycle sports through a range of activities that include sales of production racing motorcycles, support for satellite teams, and rider education programs.\n\nSoichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of international [[motorsport]]. In 1959, Honda entered five motorcycles into the [[Isle of Man TT]] race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. While always having powerful engines, it took until 1961 for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow [[Mike Hailwood]] to claim their first [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] victories in the 125 and 250&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] classes. Hailwood would later pick up their first Senior TT wins in 1966 and [[1967 Isle of Man TT|1967]]. Honda's race bikes were known for their \"sleek & stylish design\" and exotic engine configurations, such as the 5-cylinder, 22,000&nbsp;rpm, 125&nbsp;cc bike and their 6-cylinder 250&nbsp;cc and 297&nbsp;cc bikes.\n\nIn 1979, Honda returned to [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] with the [[monocoque]]-framed, [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Honda NR500|NR500]]. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, in order to provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish too much at one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted their first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in {{MGP|1983}}, Honda won their first 500&nbsp;cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] World Championship with [[Freddie Spencer]]. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top level titles with riders such as [[Mick Doohan]] and [[Valentino Rossi]]. Honda also head the number of wins at the [[Isle of Man TT]] having notched up 227 victories in the solo classes and [[Sidecar TT]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Machines.aspx?marq_Name=Honda&filter=H|title=Machine Profile - Honda|work=IOMTT.com|publisher=Duke Marketing Ltd.|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> including [[Ian Hutchinson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Hutchinson]]'s clean sweep at the [[2010 Isle of Man TT|2010 races]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Competitors.aspx?ride_id=8379&filter=H|title=Competitor Profile: Ian Hutchinson|work=IOMTT.com|publisher=Duke Marketing Ltd.|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe outright lap record on the [[Snaefell Mountain Course]] was held by Honda, set at the 2015 TT by [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] at an average speed of {{convert|132.701|mph|abbr=on}} on a [[Honda CBR1000RR]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/TT-Records.aspx|title=Isle of Man TT Records|work=IOMTT.com|publisher=Duke Marketing Ltd.|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> bettered the next year by [[Michael Dunlop]] on a [[BMW S1000RR]] at {{convert|133.962|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>[https://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/TT-Records/Lap-Records.aspx Current Isle of Man TT lap records] IOM TT database, Official website, Retrieved 1 September 2017</ref>\n\nIn the [[Motocross World Championship]], Honda has claimed six world championships.

In December 2005, Honda released ''[[Impossible Dream (Honda advert)|The Impossible Dream]]'' a two-minute panoramic advertisement filmed in New Zealand, Japan and Argentina which illustrates the founder's dream to build performance vehicles. While singing the song \"[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)|Impossible Dream]]\", a man reaches for his racing helmet, leaves his trailer on a minibike, then rides a succession of vintage Honda vehicles: a motorcycle, then a car, then a powerboat, then goes over a waterfall only to reappear piloting a [[hot air balloon]], with Garrison Keillor saying \"I couldn't have put it better myself\" as the song ends. The song is from the 1960s musical ''[[Man Of La Mancha]]'', sung by [[Andy Williams]].\n\nIn 2006, Honda released its ''Choir'' advertisement, for the UK and the internet. This had a 60-person choir who sang the car noises as film of the Honda Civic are shown.\n\nIn the mid to late 2000s in the United States, during model close-out sales for the current year before the start of the new [[model year]], Honda's advertising has had an [[animated character]] known simply as [[Mr. Opportunity]], voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]. The casual looking man talked about various deals offered by Honda and ended with the phrase \"I'm Mr. Opportunity, and I'm knockin'\", followed by him \"knocking\" on the television screen or \"thumping\" the speaker at the end of radio ads. In addition, commercials for Honda's international hatchback, the Jazz, are parodies of well-known pop culture images such as [[Tetris]] and [[Thomas The Tank Engine]].\n\nIn late 2006, Honda released an ad with [[ASIMO]] exploring a museum, looking at the exhibits with almost childlike wonderment (spreading out its arms in the aerospace exhibit, waving hello to an [[astronaut]] suit that resembles him, etc.), while Garrison Keillor ruminates on progress. It concludes with the tagline: \"More forwards please\". Honda also sponsored [[ITV Sport|ITV's]] coverage of [[Formula One]] in the UK for 2007. However they had announced that they would not continue in 2008 due to the sponsorship price requested by ITV being too high.\n\nIn May 2007, focuses on their strengths in racing and the use of the Red H badge \u2013 a symbol of what is termed as \"Hondamentalism\". The campaign highlights the lengths that Honda engineers go to in order to get the most out of an engine, whether it is for bikes, cars, powerboats \u2013 even lawnmowers. Honda released its [http://www.honda.co.uk/hondamentalism/?campaignid=CM059600W01G Hondamentalism] campaign. In the TV spot, Garrison Keillor says, \"An engineer once said to build something great is like swimming in honey\", while Honda engineers in white suits walk and run towards a great light, battling strong winds and flying debris, holding on to anything that will keep them from being blown away. Finally one of the engineers walks towards a red light, his hand outstretched. A web address is shown for the Hondamentalism website. The digital campaign aims to show how visitors to the site share many of the Hondamentalist characteristics.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, Honda released \u2013 the ''Problem Playground''. The advert outlines Honda's environmental responsibility, demonstrating a hybrid engine, more efficient solar panels and the [[FCX Clarity]], a hydrogen-powered car. The 90-second advert has large-scale puzzles, involving [[Rubik's Cube]]s, large shapes and a 3-dimensional puzzle. On 29 May 2008, Honda, in partnership with [[Channel 4]], broadcast a live advertisement. It showed [[skydivers]] jumping from an aeroplane over Spain and forming the letters H, O, N, D and A in mid-air. This live advertisement is generally agreed to be the first of its kind on British television. The advert lasted three minutes.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/02/advertising.spain |title=Plane used in Honda skydiving ad crashes in Spain, Media |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=27 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, American Honda released the ''Dream the Impossible'' documentary series, a collection of 5- to 8-minute web vignettes that focus on the core philosophies of Honda. Current short films include ''Failure: The Secret to Success'', ''Kick Out the Ladder'' and ''Mobility 2088''. They have Honda employees as well as [[Danica Patrick]], [[Christopher Guest]], [[Ben Bova]], Chee Pearlman, [[Joe Johnston]] and [[Orson Scott Card]]. The film series plays at dreams.honda.com. In the UK, national television ads feature voice-overs from American radio host [[Garrison Keillor]], while in the US the voice of Honda commercials is actor and director [[Fred Savage]].\n\n===Sports===\nThe late F1 driver [[Ayrton Senna]] stated that Honda probably played the most significant role in his three world championships. He had immense respect for founder, Soichiro Honda, and had a good relationship with Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the chairman of Honda at that time. Senna once called Honda \"the greatest company in the world\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qazi Faheem|date=2017-09-10|title=Honda Company Analysis Report|url=https://www.slideshare.net/FaheemQazi2/honda-company-analysis-report}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its marketing campaign, Honda is an official partner and sponsor of the [[National Hockey League]], the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the NHL, and the arena named after it: [[Honda Center]].

A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores the most goals wins. There is no protective equipment worn while playing. \n\nModern handball is played on a court of {{convert|40|by|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a {{Convert|6|meter|adj=on}} zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [[field handball]] and [[Czech handball]] (which were more common in the past) and [[beach handball]]. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Body contact is permitted by the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal.\n\nThe game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark. The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany, and had several revisions since. The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] as indoors, and has been an Olympic sport since. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946 and, {{as of|2016|lc=1}}, has 197 member federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/TheIHF/MemberFederations/tabid/161/Default.aspx |title=Member Federations |publisher=International Handball Federation}}</ref> The sport is most popular in the countries of continental Europe, which have won all medals but one in the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship|men's world championships]] since 1938. In the [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship|women's world championships]], only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in the Far East, North Africa and parts of [[South America]].\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Origins and development ==\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1972, MiNr 1757.jpg|thumb|Stamp depicting 1972 Olympics]]\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called ''expulsim ludere''.<ref>John Anthony Cuddon, ''The Macmillan Dictionary of Sports and Games'', p.393, Macmillan, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-19163-3}}</ref> There are records of handball-like games in medieval [[France]], and among the [[Inuit]] in [[Greenland]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of ''h\u00e5ndbold'' from [[Denmark]], ''[[Czech handball|h\u00e1zen\u00e1]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]], ''handbol'' in [[Ukraine]], and ''[[torball]]'' in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Serinex.NET|first1=SegaAlex in|title=Handball History : HAND-BALL.ORG|url=http://www.hand-ball.org/historia/|website=www.hand-ball.org|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern [[Europe]]: primarily in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, [[lieutenant]] and Olympic medalist [[Holger Nielsen]] from [[Ordrup]] grammar school, north of [[Copenhagen]]. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, [[Karl Schelenz]], and Erich Konigh from Germany. After 1919 these rules were improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between [[Germany national handball team|Germany]] and [[Belgium national handball team|Belgium]] by men in 1925 and between [[Germany women's national handball team|Germany]] and [[Austria women's national handball team|Austria]] by women in 1930.\n\nIn 1926, the Congress of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The International Amateur Handball Federation was formed in 1928 and later the International Handball Federation was formed in 1946.\n\nMen's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as team handball for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_9A_GB.pdf |title=The official Handball rules (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\nTwo teams of seven players (six field players plus one goalkeeper) take the field and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\n\n* After receiving the ball, players can pass, keep possession, or shoot the ball.\n* If possessing the ball, players must dribble (similar to a [[Dribbling#Basketball|basketball dribble]]), or can take up to three steps for up to three seconds at a time without dribbling.\n* No attacking or defending players other than the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of the goal area (within six metres of the goal). A shot or pass in the goal area is valid if completed ''before touching the floor''. Goalkeepers are allowed outside the goal area, but are not allowed to cross the goal area boundary with the ball in their hands.\n* The ball may not be passed back to the goalkeeper when they are positioned in the goal area.\n\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching inside the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. ''Doubling'' occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\n\n===Playing field===\n[[File:Handball field en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a handball playing field]]\n[[File:Rukometno igrali\u0161te kod Macanovog doma, \u010cakovec.2.jpg|thumb|An outdoor handball playing field]]\nHandball is played on a court {{convert|40|x|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six meters from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses. This implies that the middle line belongs to both halves at the same time.\n\n====Goals====\nThe goals are two meters high and three meters wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\n\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., [[wood]] or [[aluminium]]) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The three sides of the beams visible from the playing field must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\n\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\n\n====D-Zone====\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. However, the court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts his jump outside the zone and releases the ball before he lands (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\n\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, he must take the most direct path out of it. However, should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\n\n====Substitution area====\nOutside of one long edge of the playing field to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. The areas usually contain the benches as seating opportunities. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. The area always lies to the same side as the team's own goal. During half-time, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} from the middle line to the team's side.\n\n===Duration===\n[[File:Team Time Out Handball.jpg|thumb|Team timeout]] A standard match for all teams of at least age 16 has two 30-minute halves with a 10- to 15-minute halftime break. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.\n\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. Should these not decide the game either, the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds afterwards until won by one team).\n\nThe referees may call ''[[Time-out (sport)|timeout]]'' according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\n\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 ''team timeouts'' per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by team in ball possession. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black ''T'' on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding an acoustic signal and stops the time. Before that, it was one per half. For purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\n\n===Referees===\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\".<ref>Official rules, rule 17:11</ref> Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules.\n\n[[File:Kronau-Oestringen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The referees (blue shirts) keep both teams between them.]]\n\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called ''field referee'' and the other ''goal referee''. These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\n\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning or disqualification is accompanied by a yellow or red card,<ref>Official rules, hand signal 13</ref> respectively. The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\n\nThe referees are supported by a ''scorekeeper'' and a ''timekeeper'' who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\n\n===Team players, substitutes, and officials===\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the field players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\n\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\n\n====Field players====\nField players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and [[dribbling]]. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a ''double dribble'' turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-meter zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\n\n====Goalkeeper====\nOnly the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeepers]] are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the field players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. They may be substituted by a regular field player if their team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Earlier, this field player become the designated goalkeeper on the court; and had to wear some vest or bib to be identified as such. That shirt had to be equal in colour and form to the goalkeeper's shirt, to avoid confusion. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute with the goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in Rio in 2016.\n\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like [[Association football|football]]. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover. In a penalty shot, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving risks a direct disqualification (\"red card\").\n\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as a current field player, and has to follow field players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball.\n\n====Team officials====\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the [[Coach (sport)|team manager]]. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include [[physician]]s or managers. Neither official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\n\n===Ball===\n[[File:Handball the ball.jpg|thumb|A size III handball]] The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"| Size\n!scope=\"column\"| Class\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br> (cm)\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br> (in)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br> (g)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br> (oz)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n| Women and male over-16s\n|{{convert|58|\u2013|60|cm|in|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|425|\u2013|475|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n| Women, male over-12s, and female over-14s\n| {{convert|54|\u2013|56|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|325|\u2013|375|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n| Over-8s\n| {{convert|50|\u2013|52|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|290|\u2013|330|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Awarded throws===\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\n\n;Throw-off: A throw-off takes place from the center of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other offensive players must stay in their half until the referee restarts the game. The defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.\n\n:Modern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\n\n;Throw-in: The team which did not touch the ball last is awarded a throw-in when the ball fully crosses the side line or touches the ceiling. If the ball crosses the outer goal line, a throw-in is awarded only if the defending field players touched the ball last. Execution requires the thrower to place one foot on the nearest outer line to the cause. All defending players must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}. However, they are allowed to stand immediately outside their own goal area even when the distance is less than three meters.\n\n;Goalkeeper-throw: If the ball crosses the outer goal line without interference from the defending team or when deflected by the defending team's goalkeeper, or when the attacking team violates the D-zone as described above, a goalkeeper-throw is awarded to the defending team. This is the most common turnover. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from anywhere within the goal area.\n\n;Free-throw: A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team. In the latter case, the throw is deferred to the nearest spot on the free-throw line. Free-throws are the equivalent to [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]] in association football; however, conceding them is typically not seen as poor sportsmanship for the defending side, and in itself, they carry no major disadvantages. (In particular, being awarded a free throw while being on warning for passive play will not reset the warning, whereas a shot on goal will.)  The thrower may take a direct attempt for a goal which, however, is rarely feasible if the defending team has organised a defense. However, if a free throw is awarded and the half or game ends, a direct throw at the goal is typically attempted, which occasionally goes in.\n\n[[File:Kr-Oe-Siebenmeter.jpg|thumb|A seven-metre throw]]\n;Seven-meter throw: A seven-meter throw is awarded when a clear chance of scoring is illegally prevented anywhere on the court by an opposing team player, official, or spectator. It is awarded also when the referees have interrupted a legitimate scoring chance for any reason. The thrower steps with one foot behind the {{Convert|7|m|adj=on|spell=in}} line with only the defending goalkeeper between him and the goal. The goalkeeper must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}, which is marked by a short tick on the floor. All other players must remain behind the free-throw line until execution and the defending field players must keep a distance of three meters. The thrower must await the whistle blow of the referee. A seven-meter throw is the equivalent to a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in association football; however, it is far more common and typically occurs several times in a single game.\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Yellow card handball.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow card shown in a handball match]]\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-meter penalty shot.\n\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. A player can get only one warning before receiving a two-minute suspension. One player is only permitted two two-minute suspensions; after the third time, they will be shown the red card.\n\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with a one player less than the opposing team.\n\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally result in a two-minute suspension. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the field to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, the player can be given an additional two-minute suspension. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is also punishable by a two-minute suspension.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Formations===\n[[File:5-1-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 5-1 defense formation]]\n[[File:6-0-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 6-0 defense formation]]\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. However, not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\n\n====Offense====\n* Left and right wingman.These typically are fast players who excel at ball control and wide jumps from the outside of the goal perimeter in order to get into a better shooting angle at the goal. Teams usually try to occupy the left position with a right-handed player and vice versa.\n* Left and right backcourt. Goal attempts by these players are typically made by jumping high and shooting over the defenders. Thus, it is usually advantageous to have tall players with a powerful shot for these positions.\n* Centre backcourt. A player with experience is preferred on this position who acts as playmaker and the handball equivalent of a basketball [[point guard]].\n* Pivot (left and right, if applicable). This player tends to intermingle with the defence, setting picks and attempting to disrupt the defence's formation. This positions requires the least jumping skills; but ball control and physical strength are an advantage.\n\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players.\n\n====Defense====\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as ''n:m'' formations, where ''n'' is the number of players defending at the goal line and ''m'' the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\n* Far left and far right. The opponents of the wingmen.\n* Half left and half right. The opponents of the left and right backcourts.\n* Back center (left and right). Opponent of the pivot.\n* Front center. Opponent of the center backcourt, may also be set against another specific backcourt player.\n\n===Offensive play===\nAttacks are played with all field players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack ''waves'' with a decreasing chance of success:\n\n[[File:Mara Friton Handball.jpg|thumb|Women's handball - a jump shot completes a fast-break]]\n[[File:Kiril Lazarov 09.jpg|thumb|Men's handball - a jump shot ([[Kiril Lazarov]], world record-holder for the number of goals scored in one world championship) ]]\n;First wave: ''First wave'' attacks are characterised by the absence of defending players around their goal perimeter. The chance of success is very high, as the throwing player is unhindered in his scoring attempt. Such attacks typically occur after an intercepted pass or a steal, and if the defending team can switch fast to offence. The far left or far right will usually try to run the attack, as they are not as tightly bound in the defence. On a turnover, they immediately sprint forward and receive the ball halfway to the other goal. Thus, these positions are commonly held by quick players.\n;Second wave: If the first wave is not successful and some defending players have gained their positions around the zone, the second wave comes into play: the remaining players advance with quick passes to locally outnumber the retreating defenders. If one player manages to step up to the perimeter or catches the ball at this spot, he becomes unstoppable by legal defensive means. From this position, the chance of success is naturally very high. Second wave attacks became much more important with the \"fast throw-off\" rule.\n\n;Third wave: The time during which the second wave may be successful is very short, as then the defenders closed the gaps around the zone. In the ''third wave'', the attackers use standardised attack patterns usually involving crossing and passing between the back court players who either try to pass the ball through a gap to their pivot, take a jumping shot from the backcourt at the goal, or lure the defence away from a wingman.\n\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. However, this implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\n\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call '''passive play''' (since about 1995, the referee gives a passive warning some time before the actual call by holding one hand up in the air, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. If it were not for this rule, it would be easy for an attacking team to stall the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\n\n===Defensive play===\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} and {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\n\n==Organization==\nHandball teams are usually organised as [[sports club|clubs]]. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\n\n===International body===\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball.

[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] proved that if <math>R</math> is \"not too large\", in the sense that if <math>R</math> is Noetherian, the same must be true for <math>R[X]</math>. Formally,\n\n<blockquote>'''Hilbert's Basis Theorem.''' If <math>R</math> is a Noetherian ring, then <math>R[X]</math> is a Noetherian ring.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>'''Corollary.''' If <math>R</math> is a Noetherian ring, then <math>R[X_1,\\dotsc,X_n]</math> is a Noetherian ring.</blockquote>\n\nThis can be translated into [[algebraic geometry]] as follows: every [[algebraic set]] over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Hilbert|last=Hilbert|year=1890}} proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.\n\nHilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using [[mathematical induction]]; his method does not give an [[algorithm]] to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of [[Gr\u00f6bner basis|Gr\u00f6bner bases]].\n\n==Proof==\n:'''Theorem.''' If <math>R</math> is a left (resp. right) [[Noetherian ring]], then the [[polynomial ring]] <math>R[X]</math> is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.\n\n'''Remark.''' We will give two proofs, in both only the \"left\" case is considered, the proof for the right case is similar.\n\n===First Proof===\n\nSuppose <math>\\mathfrak a \\subseteq R[X]</math> were a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the [[axiom of dependent choice]]) there is a sequence <math>\\{ f_0, f_1, \\ldots \\}</math> of polynomials such that if <math>\\mathfrak b_n</math> is the left ideal generated by <math>f_0, \\ldots, f_{n-1}</math> then <math>f_n \\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak b_n</math> is of minimal degree. It is clear that <math>\\{\\deg(f_0), \\deg(f_1), \\ldots \\}</math> is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let <math>a_n</math> be the leading coefficient of <math>f_n</math> and let <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> be the left ideal in <math>R</math> generated by <math>a_0,a_1,\\ldots</math>. Since <math>R</math> is Noetherian the chain of ideals\n\n:<math>(a_0)\\subset(a_0,a_1)\\subset(a_0,a_1,a_2) \\subset \\cdots</math>\n\nmust terminate. Thus <math>\\mathfrak b = (a_0,\\ldots ,a_{N-1})</math> for some integer <math>N</math>. So in particular,\n\n:<math>a_N=\\sum_{i<N} u_{i}a_{i}, \\qquad u_i \\in R.</math>\n\nNow consider\n\n:<math>g = \\sum_{i<N}u_{i}X^{\\deg(f_{N})-\\deg(f_{i})}f_{i},</math>\n\nwhose leading term is equal to that of <math>f_N</math>; moreover, <math>g\\in\\mathfrak b_N</math>. However, <math>f_N \\notin \\mathfrak b_N</math>, which means that <math>f_N - g \\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak b_N</math> has degree less than <math>f_N</math>, contradicting the minimality.\n\n===Second Proof=== \nLet <math>\\mathfrak a \\subseteq R[X]</math> be a left-ideal. Let <math>\\mathfrak b</math> be the set of leading coefficients of members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>. This is obviously a left-ideal over <math>R</math>, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>; say <math>f_0,\\ldots, f_{N-1}</math>. Let <math>d</math> be the maximum of the set <math>\\{\\deg(f_0),\\ldots, \\deg(f_{N-1})\\}</math>, and let <math>\\mathfrak b_k</math> be the set of leading coefficients of members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>, whose degree is <math>{}\\le k</math>. As before, the <math>\\mathfrak b_k</math> are left-ideals over <math>R</math>, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>, say\n\n:<math>f^{(k)}_{0}, \\ldots, f^{(k)}_{N^{(k)}-1}</math>\n\nwith degrees <math>{}\\le k</math>. Now let <math>\\mathfrak a^*\\subseteq R[X]</math> be the left-ideal generated by:\n\n:<math>\\left \\{f_{i},f^{(k)}_{j} \\ : \\ i<N,j<N^{(k)},k<d \\right \\}.</math>\n\nWe have <math>\\mathfrak a^*\\subseteq\\mathfrak a</math> and claim also <math>\\mathfrak a\\subseteq\\mathfrak a^*</math>. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let <math>h\\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak a^*</math> be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by <math>a</math>.\n\n:<ins>Case 1:</ins> <math>\\deg(h)\\ge d</math>. Regardless of this condition, we have <math>a\\in \\mathfrak b</math>, so is a left-linear combination\n\n::<math>a=\\sum_j u_j a_j</math>\n\n:of the coefficients of the <math>f_j</math>. Consider\n\n::<math>h_0 \\triangleq\\sum_{j}u_{j}X^{\\deg(h)-\\deg(f_{j})}f_{j},</math>\n\n:which has the same leading term as <math>h</math>; moreover <math>h_0 \\in \\mathfrak a^*</math> while <math>h\\notin\\mathfrak a^*</math>. Therefore <math>h - h_0 \\in \\mathfrak a\\setminus\\mathfrak a^*</math> and <math>\\deg(h - h_0) < \\deg(h)</math>, which contradicts minimality.\n\n:<ins>Case 2:</ins> <math>\\deg(h) = k < d</math>. Then <math>a\\in\\mathfrak b_k</math> so is a left-linear combination\n\n::<math>a=\\sum_j u_j a^{(k)}_j</math>\n\n:of the leading coefficients of the <math>f^{(k)}_j</math>. Considering\n\n::<math>h_0 \\triangleq\\sum_j u_j X^{\\deg(h)-\\deg(f^{(k)}_{j})}f^{(k)}_{j},</math>\n\n:we yield a similar contradiction as in <ins>Case 1</ins>.\n\nThus our claim holds, and <math>\\mathfrak a = \\mathfrak a^*</math> which is finitely generated.\n\nNote that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of <math>X</math> multiplying the factors, were non-negative in the constructions.\n\n== Applications ==\nLet <math>R</math> be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.\n\n#By induction we see that <math>R[X_0,\\dotsc,X_{n-1}]</math> will also be Noetherian. \n#Since any [[affine variety]] over <math>R^n</math> (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal <math>\\mathfrak a\\subset R[X_0, \\dotsc, X_{n-1}]</math> and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials \u2014 i.e. the intersection of finitely many [[hypersurface]]s. \n#If <math>A</math> is a finitely-generated <math>R</math>-algebra, then we know that <math>A \\simeq R[X_0, \\dotsc, X_{n-1}] / \\mathfrak a</math>, where <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that <math>\\mathfrak a</math> must be finitely generated, say <math>\\mathfrak a = (p_0,\\dotsc, p_{N-1})</math>, i.e. <math>A</math> is [[Glossary_of_ring_theory#Finitely_presented_algebra|finitely presented]].\n\n==Formal Proof in Mizar==\nThe [[Mizar system|Mizar project]] has completely formalized and automatically checked a proof of Hilbert's basis theorem in the [http://www.mizar.org/JFM/Vol12/hilbasis.html HILBASIS file].\n\n==References==\n* Cox, Little, and O'Shea, ''Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms'', Springer-Verlag,

properties, and applications of these '''heterocycles'''.<ref name=Gilchrist/>\n\nExamples of heterocyclic compounds include all of the nucleic acids, the majority of drugs, most biomass (cellulose and related materials), and many natural and synthetic dyes.\n\n== Classification ==\nAlthough heterocyclic chemical compounds may be inorganic compounds or organic compounds, most contain at least one carbon. While atoms that are neither carbon nor hydrogen are normally referred to in organic chemistry as heteroatoms, this is usually in comparison to the all-carbon backbone. But this does not prevent a compound such as borazine (which has no carbon atoms) from being labelled \"heterocyclic\". [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommends the [[Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature]] for naming heterocyclic compounds.\n\nHeterocyclic compounds can be usefully classified based on their electronic structure.  The saturated heterocycles behave like the acyclic derivatives.  Thus, piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are conventional amines and ethers, with modified steric profiles.  Therefore, the study of heterocyclic chemistry focuses especially on unsaturated derivatives, and the preponderance of work and applications involves unstrained 5- and 6-membered rings.  Included are pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan.  Another large class of heterocycles are fused to benzene rings, which for pyridine, thiophene, pyrrole, and furan are quinoline, benzothiophene, indole, and benzofuran, respectively.  Fusion of two benzene rings gives rise to a third large family of compounds, respectively the acridine, dibenzothiophene, carbazole, and dibenzofuran.  The unsaturated rings can be classified according to the participation of the heteroatom in the conjugated system, pi system.\n\n== 3-membered rings ==\nHeterocycles with three atoms in the ring are more reactive because of [[ring strain]].

For example, with the benzo-fused unsaturated nitrogen heterocycles, pyrrole provides [[indole]] or [[isoindole]] depending on the orientation.  The pyridine analog is [[quinoline]] or [[isoquinoline]].  For azepine, [[benzazepine]] is the preferred name.  Likewise, the compounds with two benzene rings fused to the central heterocycle are [[carbazole]], [[acridine]], and dibenzoazepine. [[Thienothiophene]] are the fusion of two thiophene rings. [[Phosphaphenalene]]s are a tricyclic phosphorus-containing heterocyclic system derived from the carbocycle [[phenalene]].\n\n== History of heterocyclic chemistry ==\nThe history of heterocyclic chemistry began in the 1800s, in step with the development of [[organic chemistry]].

[42, 43], and Crucq [5]. Since that time, other authors suggest there is increasing evidence to support the theory that shock waves from high velocity bullets can cause tissue related damage and damage to the nervous system. This has been shown in various experiments using simulant models [24, 48]. One of the most interesting is a study by Courtney and Courtney [4] who showed a link between traumatic brain injury and pressure waves originating in the thoracic cavity and extremities.|Historical Overview of Wound Ballistics Research<ref>Historical Overview of Wound Ballistics Research, Nick Maiden, Forensic Sci Med Pathol (2009) 5:85\u201389</ref>}}\n\n==Distant injuries in the WDMET data==\n\nThe Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team (WDMET) gathered data on wounds sustained during the [[Vietnam War]]. In their analysis of this data published in the Textbook of Military Medicine, Ronald Bellamy and Russ Zajtchuck point out a number of cases which seem to be examples of distant injuries. Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe three mechanisms of distant wounding due to pressure transients: 1) stress waves 2) shear waves and 3) a vascular pressure impulse.\n\nAfter citing Harvey's conclusion that \"stress waves probably do not cause any tissue damage\" (p.&nbsp;136), Bellamy and Zajtchuck express their view that Harvey's interpretation might not be definitive because they write \"the possibility that stress waves from a penetrating projectile might also cause tissue damage cannot be ruled out.\" (p.&nbsp;136) The WDMET data includes a case of a lung contusion resulting from a hit to the shoulder. The caption to Figure 4-40 (p.&nbsp;149) says, \"The pulmonary injury may be the result of a stress wave.\"  They describe the possibility that a hit to a soldier's trapezius muscle caused temporary paralysis due to \"the stress wave passing through the soldier's neck indirectly [causing] cervical cord dysfunction.\" (p.&nbsp;155)\n\nIn addition to stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe shear waves as a possible mechanism of indirect injuries in the WDMET data. They estimate that 10% of bone fractures in the data may be the result of indirect injuries, that is, bones fractured by the bullet passing close to the bone without a direct impact. A Chinese experiment is cited which provides a formula estimating how pressure magnitude decreases with distance. Together with the difference between strength of human bones and strength of the animal bones in the Chinese experiment, Bellamy and Zajtchuck use this formula to estimate that assault rifle rounds \"passing within a centimeter of a long bone might very well be capable of causing an indirect fracture.\" (p.&nbsp;153) Bellamy and Zajtchuck suggest the fracture in Figures 4-46 and 4-47 is likely an indirect fracture of this type. Damage due to shear waves extends to even greater distances in abdominal injuries in the WDMET data. Bellamy and Zajtchuck write, \"The abdomen is one body region in which damage from indirect effects may be common.\" (p.&nbsp;150) Injuries to the liver and bowel shown in Figures 4-42 and 4-43 are described, \"The damage shown in these examples extends far beyond the tissue that is likely to direct contact with the projectile.\" (p.&nbsp;150)\n\nIn addition to providing examples from the WDMET data for indirect injury due to propagating shear and stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck expresses an openness to the idea of pressure transients propagating via blood vessels can cause indirect injuries. \"For example, pressure transients arising from an abdominal gunshot wound might propagate through the vena cavae and jugular venous system into the cranial cavity and cause a precipitous rise in intracranial pressure there, with attendant transient neurological dysfunction.\" (p.&nbsp;154) However, no examples of this injury mechanism are presented from the WDMET data. However, the authors suggest the need for additional studies writing, \"Clinical and experimental data need to be gathered before such indirect injuries can be confirmed.\" Distant injuries of this nature were later confirmed in the experimental data of Swedish and Chinese researchers,<ref name=\"fn_(19)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Suneson | first1 = A | last2 = Hansson | first2 = HA | last3 = Seeman | first3 = T | year = 1990 | title = Pressure Wave Injuries to the Nervous System Caused by High Energy Missile Extremity Impact: Part I.

Quranists, on the contrary, hold that if the Qur'an is silent on some matter, it is  because Allah did not hold its detail to be of consequence; and that some ahadith contradict the Qur'an, evidence that some ahadith are a source of corruption and not a compliment to the Quran.\n\nA classical example is salat (the five daily prayers of Islam), which is commanded in the Qur'an, and considered by all Muslims to be an obligatory part of Islamic religious practice -- one of the five pillars of Islam. Details of prescribed movements and words of the prayer (known as [[rakat]]) and how many times they are to be performed, are found in ahadith, demonstrating to Hadithists  that ahadith \"validly\" fulfill the Qur'anic command of ritual prayer. However, ahadith differ on these details and consequently salat is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects. (Quranists, for their part, believe if Allah thought the details of salat to be consequence, would have included them in the Quran and that the details of salat are a matter between each individual Muslim and Allah,  with ''correctly'' performed salat depending on a correct intention to perform the prayers, valid however it may be individually performed.)\n;Comparative importance of ahadith\nAmong most hadithists, the importance of ahadith is secondary to [[Qur'an]] given that, at least in theory, an Islamic [[conflict of laws]] doctrine holds Qur'anic supremacy above ahadith in developing [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]].<ref name=\"Nukat\">Ibn Hajar, Ahmad. ''al-Nukat ala Kitab ibn al-Salah'', vol. 1, p. 90. Maktabah al-Furqan.</ref> However, a minority of hadithists have historically placed ahadith on a par with the Qur'an. A smaller minority have upheld ahadith in contradiction to the Qur'an, thereby placing ahadith above Qur'an and claiming that contradictory ahadith [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogate]] the parts of the Qur'an where they conflict.\n\nIt has been narrated through a chain of narrators, including [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]] and originating with Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], that the Prophet [[Muhammad]] once addressed his people in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] saying \u2018O people, whatever comes to you in the form of my Hadith, if it agrees with the Holy Book of Allah, it is genuine, but whatever comes to you that does not agree with the book of Allah you must know that I have not said it.' <ref name = Kafi2013/>{{rp|5}}\n\n==Components, schools, types==\n===Impact===\nThe hadith had a profound and controversial influence on ''[[tafsir]]'' (commentaries of the Quran). The earliest commentary of the Quran known as [[Tafsir Ibn Abbas]] is sometimes attributed to the companion Ibn Abbas.\n\nThe hadith were used in forming the basis of ''[[Sharia]]'' (the religious law system forming part of the Islamic tradition), and ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence). The hadith are at the root of why there is no single ''fiqh'' system, but rather a collection of parallel systems within Islam.\n\nMuch of early Islamic history available today is also based on the hadith, although it has been challenged for its lack of basis in primary source material and the internal contradictions of the secondary material available.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n====Types====\n{{anchor|Sacred hadith}} Hadith may be ''hadith qudsi'' (sacred hadith) \u2014 which some Muslims regard as the words of [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Allah]]) \u2014 or ''hadith sharif'' (noble hadith), which are Muhammad's own utterances.<ref name=\"Glasse-159\">{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|origyear=1989 |date=2001|publisher=Altamira|page=159}}</ref> \n\nAccording to as-Sayyid ash-Sharif al-Jurjani, the hadith qudsi differ from the Quran in that the former are \"expressed in Muhammad's words\", whereas the latter are the \"[[Revelation|direct words of God]]\". A ''hadith qudsi'' need not be a ''sahih'' (sound hadith), but may be ''da\u2018if'' or even ''mawdu\u2018''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aslamna.info/hadith_qudsi.html|title=Qu'est-ce que le hadith Qudsi ?|work=aslamna.info}}</ref>\n\nAn example of a ''hadith qudsi'' is the hadith of [[Abu Hurairah]] who said that Muhammad said:\n<blockquote>When God decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: My mercy prevails over My wrath.<ref>Related by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|al-Bukhari]], [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]], [[Al-Nasa'i|an-Nasa'i]] and [[Ibn Majah]].</ref>{{Primary source inline|reason=Need secondary source confirming that this is a hadith qudsi |date=November 2015}}</blockquote>\n\n===Components===\nThe two major aspects of a hadith are the text of the report (the ''matn''), which contains the actual narrative, and the chain of narrators (the ''isnad''), which documents the route by which the report has been transmitted.{{sfn|Brown, Jonathan A.C. (2009)|p=4}}<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/> The isnad was an effort to document that a hadith had actually come from Muhammad, and Muslim scholars from the eighth century until today have never ceased repeating the mantra \"The isnad is part of the religion \u2014 if not for the isnad, whoever wanted could say whatever they wanted.\"{{sfn|Brown, Jonathan A.C. (2009)|p=4}} The ''isnad'' means literally 'support', and it is so named due to the reliance of the hadith specialists upon it in determining the [[hadith terminology|authenticity or weakness of a hadith]].<ref>''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 1, pp. 39\u201341 with abridgement.</ref> The ''isnad'' consists of a chronological list of the narrators, each mentioning the one from whom they heard the hadith, until mentioning the originator of the ''matn'' along with the ''matn'' itself.\n\nThe first people to hear hadith were the companions who preserved it and then conveyed it to those after them. Then the generation following them received it, thus conveying it to those after them and so on. So a companion would say, \"I heard the Prophet say such and such.\" The Follower would then say, \"I heard a companion say, 'I heard the Prophet.'\" The one after him would then say, \"I heard someone say, 'I heard a Companion say, 'I heard the Prophet...''\" and so on.<ref>''Ilm al-Rijal wa Ahimiyatih'', by Mualami, p. 16, Dar al-Rayah.</ref>\n\n===Different schools===\nDifferent branches of Islam refer to different collections of hadith, though the same incident may be found in hadith in different collections:\n*In the Sunni branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[Kutub al-Sittah|the six books]]'', of which [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]] generally have the highest status. The other books of hadith are [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]] and [[Sunan ibn Majah]]. However the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four Sunni \"schools of thought\" (''[[madhhab]]s''), traditionally reject Sunan ibn Majah and assert the canonical status of [[Muwatta Imam Malik]].  \n*In the [[Twelver]] Shi'a branch of Islam, the canonical hadith collections are ''[[the Four Books]]'': [[Kitab al-Kafi]], [[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]], [[Tahdhib al-Ahkam]], and [[Al-Istibsar]]. \n*In the [[Ibadi]] branch of Islam, the main canonical collection is the [[Tartib al-Musnad]]. This is an expansion of the earlier [[Jami Sahih]] collection, which retains canonical status in its own right.\n*The [[Ismaili]] shia sects use the [[Daim al-Islam]] as hadith collections. \n*The [[Ahmadiyya]] sect generally rely on the Sunni canons.\n*Some minor groups, collectively known as [[Quranists]], reject the authority of the hadith collections altogether.<ref name=\"Aisha Y. Musa 2013\"/><ref name=\"Neal Robinson 2013 pp. 85-89\"/>\n\nIn general, the difference between Shi'a and Sunni collections is that Shia give preference to ahadith credited to the Prophet's family and close associates (''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]''), while Sunnis do not consider family lineage in evaluating aHadith and Sunnah narrated by any of twelve thousand companions of Muhammad.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=Religions.

Scholars had to decide which hadith were to be trusted as authentic and which had been invented for political or theological purposes. To do this, they used a number of techniques which Muslims now call the science of hadith.<ref>Islam \u2013 the Straight Path, John Eposito, p.81</ref>\n\n===Shia and Sunni textual traditions===\n{{Islam |texts}}\nSunni and Shia hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters. Narrators who took the side of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] rather than [[Ali]], in the disputes over leadership that followed the death of Muhammad, are seen as unreliable by the Shia; narrations sourced to [[Ali]] and the family of Muhammad, and to their supporters, are preferred. Sunni scholars put trust in narrators, such as [[Aisha]], whom Shia reject. Differences in hadith collections have contributed to differences in worship practices and shari'a law and have hardened the dividing line between the two traditions.\n\n====Extent and nature in the Sunni tradition====\nIn the Sunni tradition, the number of such texts is somewhere between seven and thirteen thousand,<ref>See the references and discussion by Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah ''Thalathatu rasa'il fi ulum al-hadith; risalat abi dawud ila ahl makkata fi wasf sunanihi'', pg 36, footnote. Beirut: ''Maktaba al-Matbu'at al-Islamiyah'': 2nd ed 1426/2005.</ref> but the number of ''ahadith'' is far greater because several ''isnad'' sharing the same text are each counted as individual ahadith. If,  say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident in the life of Muhammad, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths\u2014but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century. In the 3rd century of Islam (from 225/840 to about 275/889),<ref>The earliest book, Bukhari's Sahih was composed by 225/840 since he states that he spent sixteen years composing it (''Hady al-Sari'', introduction to ''Fath al-Bari'', p. 489, Lahore: ''Dar Nashr al-Kutub al-Islamiya'', 1981/1401) and also that he showed it to Yahya ibn Ma'in (p. 8, ibid.) who died in 233. Nasa'i, the last to die of the authors of the six books, died in 303/915. He probably completed this work a few decades before his death: by 275 or so.</ref> [[Hadith terminology#\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25|hadith experts]] composed brief works recording a selection of about two- to five-thousand such texts which they felt to have been most soundly documented or most widely referred to in the Muslim scholarly community.<ref>Counting multiple narrations of the same texts as a single text, the number of hadiths each author has recorded roughly as follows: Bukhari (as in Zabidi's ''Mukhtasar'' of Bukhari's book) 2134, Muslim (as in Mundhiri's ''Mukhtasar'' of Muslim's book) 2200, Tirmidhi 4000, Abu Dawud 4000, Nasa'i 4800, Ibn Majah 4300. There is considerable overlap amongst the six books so that Ibn al-Athir's ''Jami' al-Usul'', which gathers together the hadiths texts of all six books deleting repeated texts, has about 9500 hadiths.</ref> The 4th and 5th century saw these six works being commented on quite widely. This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the place of departure for any serious study of hadith. In addition, Bukhari and Muslim in particular, claimed that they were collecting only the soundest of sound hadiths. These later scholars tested their claims and agreed to them, so that today, they are considered the most reliable collections of hadith.<ref>''Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah'', p. 160 Dar al-Ma\u2019aarif edition</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century, [[Ibn al-Qaisarani]] formally standardized the Sunni canon into [[Al-Kutub al-Sittah|six pivotal works]], a delineation which remains to this day.<ref>[[Ign\u00e1c Goldziher]], ''Muslim Studies'', vol. 2, p. 240.

Some are more general, like the ''mu\u1e63annaf'', the ''mu\u02bfjam'', and the ''j\u0101mi\u02bf'', and some more specific, either characterized by the topics treated, like the ''sunan'' (restricted to legal-liturgical traditions), or by its composition, like the [[Forty hadith|''arba\u02bf\u012bniyy\u0101t'']] (collections of forty hadiths).<ref name=\"siddiqi\">Muhammad Zubayr Siddiqi, ''Hadith Literature'', Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1993, edited and revised by Abdal Hakim Murad.</ref>\n\n====Extent and nature in the Shia tradition====\nShi'a Muslims hardly ever use the [[six major hadith collections]] followed by the Sunni, as they never usually trust many of the Sunni narrators and transmitters. They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are [[The Four Books]], which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174\">Momen, Moojan, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.174.</ref> The Four Books are: ''Kitab al-Kafi'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''Al-Tahdhib'' and ''Al-Istibsar'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.\n\nUnlike Sunnis, Shia do not consider any of their hadith collections to be sahih (authentic) in their entirety. Therefore, every individual hadith in a specific collection must be investigated separately to determine its authenticity.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammad A. Shomali|title=Shi'i Islam: Origins, Faith and Practices|date=2003|publisher=ICAS Press|isbn=9781904063117|page=35|edition=reprint}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Hadith in the Shia school of thought is well documented. This can be captured by Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Muhammad, when he narrated that \"Whoever of our Shia (followers) knows our [[Shariah]] and takes out the weak of our followers from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge (Hadith) which we (Ahl al-Bayt) have gifted to them, he on the day of judgement will come with a crown on his head. It will shine among the people gathered on the plain of resurrection.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/> [[Hassan al-Askari]], a descendent of Muhammad, gave support to this narration, stating \"Whoever he had taken out in the worldly life from the darkness of ignorance can hold to his light to be taken out of the darkness of the plain of resurrection to the garden (paradise). Then all those whomever he had taught in the worldly life anything of goodness, or had opened from his heart a lock of ignorance or had removed his doubts will come out.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\"/>\n\nRegarding the importance of maintaining accuracy in recording Hadith, it has been documented that [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the great grandson of Muhammad, has said that \"Holding back in a doubtful issue is better than entering destruction. Your not narrating a Hadith is better than you narrating a Hadith in which you have not studied thoroughly. On every truth, there is a reality. Above every right thing, there is a light. Whatever agrees with the book of Allah you must take it and whatever disagrees you must leave it alone.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\">{{cite book|last1=ibn Ya\u2019qub al-Kulayni|first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad|title=Kitab al-Kafi|date=February 2013|publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9890016-2-5|edition=eBook}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Al-Baqir also emphasized the selfless devotion of Ahl al-Bayt to preserving the traditions of the Islamic Prophet through his conversation with [[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]], an old companion of Muhammad. He (Al-Baqir) said, \"Oh Jabir, had we spoken to you from our opinions and desires, we would be counted among those who are destroyed. We speak to you of the Ahadith which we treasure from the Messenger of Allah, Oh Allah grant compensation to Muhammad and his family worthy of their services to your cause, just as they treasure their gold and silver.\"<ref name=\"Kafi2013\" /> Further, it has been narrated that [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the son of al-Baqir, has said the following regarding hadith: \"You must write it down; you will not memorize until you write it down.\"<ref name= Kafi2013/>{{rp|33}}\n\n===Modern usage===\n[[File:Forty hadith nawawi taught by Sheikh Usama al Azhari in Sultan Hassan Mosque.JPG|thumb|[[Imam Nawawi's Forty Hadith]] taught in the [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan]] in Cairo, Egypt]]\nThe mainstream sects consider hadith to be essential supplements to, and clarifications of, the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as for clarifying issues pertaining to Islamic jurisprudence. [[Ibn al-Salah]], a hadith specialist, described the relationship between hadith and other aspect of the religion by saying: \"It is the science most pervasive in respect to the other sciences in their various branches, in particular to jurisprudence being the most important of them.\"<ref>''Ulum al-Hadith'' by Ibn al-Salah, p. 5, Dar al-Fikr, with the verification of Nur al-Din al-\u2018Itr.</ref> \"The intended meaning of 'other sciences' here are those pertaining to religion,\" explains Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, \"Quranic exegesis, hadith, and jurisprudence. The science of hadith became the most pervasive due to the need displayed by each of these three sciences. The need hadith has of its science is apparent. As for Quranic [[exegesis]], then the preferred manner of explaining the speech of God is by means of what has been accepted as a statement of Muhammad. The one looking to this is in need of distinguishing the acceptable from the unacceptable. Regarding jurisprudence, then the jurist is in need of citing as an evidence the acceptable to the exception of the later, something only possible utilizing the science of hadith.\"<ref name=\"Nukat\"/>\n\n==Studies==\n{{Main|Hadith studies}}\nAccording to Bernard Lewis, \"in the early Islamic centuries there could be no better way of promoting a cause, an opinion, or a faction than to cite an appropriate action or utterance of the Prophet.\" To fight these forgeries, the elaborate science of hadith studies was devised.<ref name=\"EMHME-80\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard |title=The End of Modern History in the Middle East |date=2011|publisher=Hoover Institution Press |page=79-80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGzsn4snUyEC&pg=PA80&dq=hadith+bernard+lewis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig_vDpjpDaAhUq3IMKHQLiC6AQ6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&q=hadith%20bernard%20lewis&f=false|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>  \nHadith studies use a number of methods of evaluation developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various classifications were devised for hadith. The earliest comprehensive work in hadith studies was [[Ramahurmuzi|Abu Muhammad al-Ramahurmuzi's]] ''al-Muhaddith al-Fasil'', while another significant work was [[Hakim al-Nishaburi|al-Hakim al-Naysaburi]]'s ''Ma\u2018rifat \u2018ulum al-hadith''. Ibn al-Salah's [[Introduction to the Science of Hadith|''\u02bbUlum al-hadith'']] is considered the standard classical reference on hadith studies.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/>\n\n===Terminology: admissible and inadmissible hadiths===\n{{Main|Hadith terminology}}\nBy means of hadith terminology, hadith are categorized as ''\u1e63a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25'' (sound, authentic), ''[[Hadith terminology#\u1e0ca\u02bf\u012bf|\u1e0da\u02bf\u012bf]]'' (weak), or ''[[Hadith terminology#Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf|maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf]]'' (fabricated). Other classifications used also include: ''[[Hadith terminology#\u1e24asan|\u1e25asan]]'' (good), which refers to an otherwise ''\u1e63a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25'' report suffering from minor deficiency, or a weak report strengthened due to numerous other corroborating reports; and ''[[Hadith terminology#Munkar|munkar]]'' (denounced) which is a report that is rejected due to the presence of an unreliable transmitter contradicting another more reliable narrator.<ref>See:\n* \"Hadith,\" ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online'';\n* \"Hadith,\" ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world''.</ref> Both ''sah\u012bh'' and ''hasan'' reports are considered acceptable for usage in Islamic legal discourse. Classifications of hadith may also be based upon the scale of transmission. Reports that pass through many reliable transmitters at each point in the ''isnad'' up until their collection and transcription are known as ''[[Hadith terminology#Mutawatir|mutaw\u0101tir]]''. These reports are considered the most authoritative as they pass through so many different routes that collusion between all of the transmitters becomes an impossibility. Reports not meeting this standard are known  as ''[[Hadith terminology#Ahaad|aahad]]'', and are of several different types.<ref name=\"H-EoI\"/>\n\n===Biographical evaluation===\n{{Main|Biographical evaluation}}\nAnother area of focus in the study of hadith is biographical analysis (''[[Biographical evaluation|\u2018ilm al-rij\u0101l]]'', lit. \"science of people\"), in which details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (''thiq\u0101t'') of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain.<ref>Berg (2000) p. 8</ref> Examples of biographical dictionaries include: [[Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi]]'s ''[[Al-Kamal fi Asma' al-Rijal]]'', Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's ''Tahdh\u012bb al-Tahdh\u012bb'' and [[al-Dhahabi]]'s ''Tadhkirat al-huffaz''.<ref>See:\n* Robinson (2003) pp. 69\u201370;\n* Lucas (2004) p. 15</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of Hadith}}\nRelated article: [[Goldziher|''Goldziher on Had\u012bth'']]\n\nThe major points of intra-Muslim criticism of the Hadith literature is based in questions regarding its authenticity.<ref name=wael>{{cite journal |last= B.

Atop the hull may be a [[deckhouse]] or some other form of superstructure, like a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]. The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the [[waterline]].\n\nThe structure of the hull varies depending on the vessel type. In a typical modern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks, major transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal) members called [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], intermediate members such as [[girders]], [[wikt:stringer|stringers]] and [[I-beam|webs]], and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the [[structural arrangement]]. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the \"upper deck\", \"weather deck\", \"spar deck\", \"[[main deck]]\", or simply \"deck\". The particular name given depends on the context\u2014the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails. Not all hulls are decked (for instance a [[dinghy]]).\n\nIn a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a [[keel]]. In [[fiberglass]] or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a [[Monocoque#Boats and ships|monocoque]] arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vasas hull profile.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the Swedish warship, [[Vasa (ship)|''Vasa'']].]]\n{{expand section | examples and additional citations|date = June 2017}}\nRafts have a hull of sorts, however, hulls of the [[Stone Age|earliest design]] are thought to have each consisted of a hollowed out [[tree]] bole: in effect the first [[canoe]]s. Hull form then proceeded to the [[coracle]] shape and on to more sophisticated forms as the science of [[naval architecture]] advanced.\n\nBy around [[30th century BC|3000 BC]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ians knew how to assemble wooden [[plank (wood)|planks]] into a [[hull (ship)|hull]].<ref name=\"AIA\">Ward, Cheryl.  \"World's Oldest Planked Boats,\" in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. [http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html Archaeology.org]</ref>\n\n==General features==\nThe shape of the hull is entirely dependent upon the needs of the design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an [[icebreaker]] or the flat bottom of a [[landing craft]].\n\n==Hull shapes==\n{{Further|Chine (boating)}}\nHulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape, (e.g., a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft), but are grouped primarily as follows:\n* Chined and Hard-chined. Examples are the flat-bottom (chined), v-bottom, and multi-bottom hull (hard chined). These types have at least one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length.\n* Moulded, round bilged or soft-[[chine (boating)|chined]]. These hull shapes all have smooth curves. Examples are the round bilge, semi-round bilge, and s-bottom hull.\n\n===Categorization===\n<!-- [[Waterline]] links to this section -->\n\nAfter this they can be categorized as:\n* Displacement\nThe hull is supported exclusively or predominantly by [[buoyancy]]. Vessels that have this type of hull travel through the water at a limited rate that is defined by the waterline length. They are often, though not always, heavier than planing types.\n* Planing\n[[File:Royal Navy MTB 5.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Navy]] World War II [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]] planing at speed on calm water showing its [[Chine (boating)#Various types of chine hulls|hard chine hull]] with most of the forepart of the boat out of the water.]]\nThe [[Planing (boat)|planing]] hull form is configured to develop positive dynamic pressure so that its draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is to have at least one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds<!-- Removed the suggestion that hull speed is a \"maximum\" speed which can't be overcome -- see [[Hull speed]] or <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/hull-speed-1220.html|title=Hull speed|publisher=}}</ref> for an explanation of this missconception -->, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.\n* Semi-displacement, or semi-planing\nThe hull form is capable of developing a moderate amount of dynamic lift; however, most of the vessel's weight is still supported through buoyancy.\n\n===Most used hull forms===\nAt present, the most widely used form is the round bilge hull.<ref>Zeilen: Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref>\n\nIn the [[inverted bell]] shape of the hull, with a smaller payload the [[waterline]] cross-section is less, hence the resistance is less and the speed is higher. With a higher payload the outward bend provides smoother performance in waves. As such, the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls.\n\n===Hull forms===\n\n====Chined and hard-chined hulls====\n{{Further|Chine (boating)}}\n\nA chined hull consists of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set at an angle to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'{{nbsp}}x{{nbsp}}4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3\u20136&nbsp;mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun \"pirogue\" is an example of a craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at [[Planing (sailing)|planing]]. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.\n\nChined hulls can be divided up into three shapes:\n* Flat-bottom chined hulls\n* Multi-chined hulls\n* V-bottom chined hulls. Sometimes called hard chine.\n\nEach of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use. The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag  hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth,fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are  more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a V{{nbsp}}shape between 6{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6{{nbsp}}degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep V{{nbsp}}form (between 18{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.\nDisplacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area, hence more drag, than an equivalent round hull form, for any given displacement.\n\n====Smooth curve hulls====\n{{Further|Smooth curve hull}}\n\nSmooth curve hulls are hulls which use, just like the curved hulls, a sword or an attached keel.\n\nSemi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round. The advantage of the semi-round is that it is a nice middle between the S-bottom and chined hull. Typical examples of a semi-round bilge hull can be found in the [[Centaur]] and [[Laser (sailboat)|Laser]] cruising [[dinghies]].\n\n[[Image:Chine types.svg|thumb|right|100px|(A) S-bottom hull<br>compared to a<br>(B) hard and<br>(C) soft chine hull]]\n\nS-bottom hulls are hulls shaped like an ''s'' . In the s-bottom, the hull runs smooth to the keel. As there are no sharp corners in the fuselage. Boats with this hull have a fixed keel, or a ''kielmidzwaard'' (literally \"keel with sword\"). This is a short fixed keel, with a swing keel inside. Examples of cruising dinghies that use this s-shape are the [[Yngling (keelboat)|Yngling]] and [[Randmeer]].\n\n==Appendages==\n\n:* Control devices such as a [[rudder]], [[Trim tab#Uses in boats|trim tabs]] or stabilizing fins may be fitted.\n:* A [[keel]] may be fitted on a hull to increase the transverse stability, directional stability or to create lift.\n:* A protrusion below the waterline forward is called a [[bulbous bow]] and is fitted on some hulls to reduce the [[wave making resistance]] [[drag (physics)|drag]] and thus increase [[fuel efficiency]]. Bulbs fitted at the stern are less common but accomplish a similar task.

If you draw a box around the submerged part of the ship, it is the ratio of the box volume occupied by the ship. It gives a sense of how much of the block defined by the L<sub>WL</sub>, beam (B) & draft (T) is filled by the hull. Full forms such as oil tankers will have a high C<sub>b</sub> where fine shapes such as sailboats will have a low C<sub>b</sub>.\n:::<math>\nC_b = \\frac {V}{L_{WL} \\cdot B_{WL} \\cdot T_{WL}}\n</math>\n\n::2) Midship coefficient ('''C<sub>m</sub>''' or '''C<sub>x</sub>''') is the cross-sectional area (A<sub>x</sub>) of the slice at midships (or at the largest section for C<sub>x</sub>) divided by beam x draft. It displays the ratio of the largest underwater section of the hull to a rectangle of the same overall width and depth as the underwater section of the hull. This defines the fullness of the underbody. A low C<sub>m</sub> indicates a cut-away mid-section and a high C<sub>m</sub> indicates a boxy section shape. Sailboats have a cut-away mid-section with low C<sub>x</sub> whereas cargo vessels have a boxy section with high C<sub>x</sub> to help increase the C<sub>b</sub>.\n:::<math>\nC_m = \\frac {A_m}{ B_{WL} \\cdot T_{WL}}\n</math>\n\n::3) Prismatic coefficient ('''C<sub>p</sub>''') is the volume (V) divided by L<sub>WL</sub>x A<sub>x</sub>. It displays the ratio of the immersed volume of the hull to a volume of a prism with equal length to the ship and cross-sectional area equal to the largest underwater section of the hull (midship section). This is used to evaluate the distribution of the volume of the underbody. A low or fine C<sub>p</sub> indicates a full mid-section and fine ends, a high or full C<sub>p</sub> indicates a boat with fuller ends. Planing hulls and other highspeed hulls tend towards a higher C<sub>p</sub>.

The waterplane coefficient expresses the fullness of the waterplane, or the ratio of the waterplane area to a rectangle of the same length and width. A low C<sub>w</sub> figure indicates fine ends and a high C<sub>w</sub> figure indicates fuller ends. High C<sub>w</sub> improves stability as well as handling behavior in rough conditions.\n:::<math>\nC_w = \\frac {A_w}{L_{WL} \\cdot B_{WL}}\n</math>\n\n::'''Note:'''\n:::<math>\nC_b = {C_{p} \\cdot C_{m} }\n</math>\n\n==Computer-aided design==\nUse of [[computer-aided design]] has superseded paper-based methods of ship design that relied on manual calculations and lines drawing. Since the early 1990s, a variety of commercial and freeware software packages specialized for naval architecture have been developed that provide 3D drafting capabilities combined with calculation modules for hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

The word ''hymn'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} (''hymnos''), which means \"a song of praise\". A writer of hymns is known as a [[hymnodist]]. The singing or composition of hymns is called '''hymnody'''. Collections of hymns are known as [[hymnal]]s or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.\n\nAlthough most familiar to speakers of English in the context of [[Christianity]], hymns are also a fixture of other [[major religious groups|world religions]], especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.\n\n==Origins==\nAncient hymns include the [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]; the Hurrian [[Hymn to Nikkal]]; the ''[[Vedas]]'', a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]; and the [[Psalms]], a collection of songs from [[Judaism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religions]]. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ({{lang|grc|\u1f5d\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9}}) by the [[Alexandria]]n poet [[Callimachus]].\n\n[[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writers began applying the term {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, or ''hymnus'' in [[Latin]], to [[Christian]] songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for \"[[Psalms|psalm]]\".<ref>Entry on {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 8th edition 1897, 1985 printing), p. 1849; entry on 'hymnus,' Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 872.</ref>\n\n== Christian hymnody ==\nOriginally modeled on the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as \"[[canticle]]s\") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]]. Many refer to [[Jesus Christ]] either directly or indirectly.\n\nSince the earliest times, Christians have sung \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\", both in private devotions and in corporate worship ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:30|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|14:26|esv}}; {{bibleverse|Acts|16:25|esv}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|14:26|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:19|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|nrsv}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:8\u201310|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|14:1\u20135|nrsv}}).\n\nNon-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include '[[Phos Hilaron]]', '[[Sub tuum praesidium]]', and '[[Te Deum]]'.\n\nOne definition of a hymn is \"...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it.\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last1=Eskew\n | last2=McElrath\n | title=Sing with Understanding, An Introduction to Christian Hymnology\n | year=1980\n | isbn=0-8054-6809-9\n}}</ref>\n\nChristian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and the Feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], or during particular seasons such as [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]. Others are used to encourage reverence for the [[Bible]] or to celebrate Christian practices such as the [[eucharist]] or [[baptism]]. Some hymns praise or address individual [[saints]], particularly the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]; such hymns are particularly prevalent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and to some extent [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism]].\n\nA writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. \"nineteenth century Methodist hymnody\" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a ''[[hymnal]]'' or ''hymnary''. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a ''hymnologist'', and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is [[hymnology]]. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a [[hymn tune]].\n\nIn many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the [[Jesus movement]] and [[Jesus music]]. Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns ''have'' seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] in nature, as modern hymn writers such as [[Keith Getty|Keith and Kristyn Getty]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-praise-of-hymns/|title=In praise of hymns|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}</ref> and [[Sovereign Grace Churches|Sovereign Grace]] Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards <sup>[according to whom?]</sup> such as the hymn, ''[[In Christ Alone]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Songs of faith|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/songs-of-faith/|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Music and accompaniment ===\nIn ancient and medieval times, [[string instrument]]s such as the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]] were used with psalms and hymns.\n\nSince there is a lack of [[musical notation]] in early writings,<ref>Entry on \"Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission,\" Warren Anderson, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Grove Music Online] (2007\u20132009) (subscription required).</ref> the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of [[Gregorian chant]] or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight [[church modes]], and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in [[Latin]], many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century ''[[Of the Father's Heart Begotten]]'' sung to the 11th century plainsong ''Divinum Mysterium''.\n\n==== Western church ====\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral South Organ, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Hymns are often accompanied by [[pipe organ|organ]] music]]\nLater hymnody in the [[Western church]] introduced four-part vocal [[harmony]] as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by [[organ (music)|organ]] and choir. It shares many elements with [[European classical music|classical music]].\n\nToday, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and ''[[a cappella]]'' congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.\n\nTo illustrate [[Protestant]] usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the [[Methodist]] churches, which are based upon [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the [[processional hymn|processional]] to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the [[recessional hymn|recessional]], and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. The [[Doxology]] is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.\n\n[[Contemporary worship|Contemporary Christian worship]], as often found in [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], may include the use of [[contemporary worship music]] played with [[electric guitar]]s and the [[drum kit]], sharing many elements with [[rock music]].\n\nOther groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied ''[[a cappella]]'' congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Mennonites]], [[Primitive Baptists]], and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] have abandoned this stance.\n\n====Eastern church====\n[[Eastern Christianity]] (the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches) have a very rich and ancient hymnographical tradition.\n\nEastern chant is almost always [[a cappella]], and instrumental accompaniment is rare. The central form of chant in the Eastern Orthodoxy is [[Byzantine Chant]], which is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship. Exceptions include the [[Coptic Orthodox]] tradition which makes use of the [[cymbals]] and the [[Triangle (musical instrument)]], the [[Indian Orthodox]] (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) which makes use of the [[organ (music)|organ]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], which also uses [[drum]]s, [[cymbals]] and other instruments on certain occasions.\n\n=== Development of Christian hymnody ===\n[[Thomas Aquinas]], in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: \"''Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem''.\" (\"A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.\")<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Aquinas\n | first = Thomas\n | authorlink = Thomas Aquinas\n | title = St. Thomas's Introduction to his Exposition of the Psalms of David\n | url=http://www4.desales.edu/~philtheo/loughlin/ATP/Proemium.html\n | accessdate = 2008-02-08\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the [[regulative principle of worship]], favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as [[exclusive psalmody]]. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the [[Scottish Presbyterian|Presbyterian churches of western Scotland]].\n\n{{Listen\n | filename=Ein' Feste Burg.ogg\n | title=\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\"\n | description=Luther's paraphrase of [[Psalm 46]] is a popular [[Lutheran hymn]]\n}}\nThe other Reformation approach, the [[normative principle of worship]], produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. [[Martin Luther]] is notable not only as a reformer, but as the [[List of hymns by Martin Luther|author of many hymns]] including \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]\"), which is sung today even by Catholics, and \"[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]\" (\"Praise be to You, Jesus Christ\") for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the [[Unitas Fratrum]]. Count [[Zinzendorf]], the Lutheran leader of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly [[Psalm]]s; [[Isaac Watts]] followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Wilson-Dickson\n | first = Andrew\n | title = The Story of Christian Music\n | publisher = Lion, [[SPCK]]\n | location = Oxford\n | year = 1992\n | pages = 110\u2013111\n | isbn = 0-281-04626-3\n}}</ref>\nWatts (1674\u20131748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, \"Behold the glories of the Lamb\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Routley\n | first = Erik\n | title = Christian Hymns, An Introduction to Their Story (Audio Book)\n | publisher = Prestige Publications, Inc.\n | location = Princeton\n | year = 1980 \n | page = Part 7, \"Isaac Watts, the Liberator of English Hymnody\"\n}}</ref>\nFound in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5:6, 8, 9, 10, 12.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Routley and Richardson\n | title =  A Panorama of Christian Hymnody\n | publisher = G.I.A.

Isaac Watts has been called \"the father of English hymnody\", but Erik Routley sees him more as \"the liberator of English hymnody\", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Christian Hymns, An Introduction to Their Story (Audio Book) op. cit.\n | page = Part 7, \"Isaac Watts, the Liberator of English Hymnody\"\n}}</ref>\n\nLater writers took even more freedom, some even including [[allegory]] and [[metaphor]] in their texts.\n\n[[Charles Wesley]]'s hymns spread Methodist [[theology]], not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhere shall my wondering soul begin?\nHow shall I all to heaven aspire?\nA slave redeemed from death and sin,\nA brand plucked from eternal fire,\nHow shall I equal triumphs raise,\nOr sing my great deliverer's praise.\n</poem>}}\n\n{{Listen\n|title=Battle Hymn of the Republic\n|filename=Battle Hymn of the Republic, Frank C. Stanley, Elise Stevenson.ogg\n|description=The Battle Hymn of the Republic, performed by [[Frank C. Stanley]], [[Elise Stevenson]], and a mixed quartet in 1908. \n}}\n\nWesley's contribution, along with the [[Second Great Awakening]] in [[United States|America]] led to a new style called [[Gospel music|gospel]], and a new explosion of sacred music writing with [[Fanny Crosby]], [[Lina Sandell]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated \"gospel songs\" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction, \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" is a hymn (no refrain), but \"[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]\" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship ''per se'' by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).\n\nThe [[Methodist Revival]] of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] and [[Ann Griffiths]]. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in [[Wales]].<ref>E. Wyn James, 'The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn', in ''Dissenting Praise'', ed. I. Rivers & D. L. Wykes (OUP, 2011); E. Wyn James, \u2018German Chorales and American Songs and Solos: Contrasting Chapters in Welsh Congregational Hymn-Singing\u2019, ''The Bulletin of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 295, Vol. 22:2 (Spring 2018), 43\u201353.</ref>\n\nAlong with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from [[Mozart]] to [[Monteverdi]], the [[Catholic Church]] continued to produce many popular hymns such as [[Lead, Kindly Light]], [[Silent Night]], O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.\n\nMany churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by [[popular music]]. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see [[contemporary worship]]). This is not new; the Christian [[Contemporary Christian Music|pop music]] style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.\n\nThis long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and [[gospel music]] (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.\n\n====American developments====\n[[African-American]]s developed a rich hymnody from [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.<ref>Music, David.

Print.</ref>\n\nHymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly, [[Stephen Foster]] wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.<!-- references forthcoming -->\n\nThomas Symmes{{clarify|date=January 2011}} spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes' colleagues{{who|date=January 2011}} who felt it was \"like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time\".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[William Billings]], a [[singing school]] teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions.

Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.</ref>\n\nEarlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially [[Shape note|shape notes]], exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to [[Sight-reading|sing from sight]], instead of the more common [[lining out]] that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including [[Benjamin Franklin White|B.F. White's]] ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', and earlier works like the [[The Missouri Harmony|''Missouri Harmony'']], ''[[Kentucky Harmony]]'', [[The Hesperian Harp|''Hesperian Harp'']], D.H. Mansfield's ''The American Vocalist'', ''The Social Harp'', the ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[The Christian Harmony|Christian Harmony]]'', [[Jeremiah Ingalls]]' ''Christian Harmony'', and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of (then) more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English [[West gallery music|West Gallery music]]), [[Fuguing tune|fuging]] sections, [[Anthem|anthems]] and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isn't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his sweetheart singing together from the ''Missouri Harmony'' during his youth. \n\nBy the 1860s musical reformers like [[Lowell Mason]] (the so-called \"better music boys\") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more \"refined\" and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained [[Choir|choirs]] to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was \"re-discovered\" by [[Alan Lomax]] in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[George Pullen Jackson]] prior to this). Indeed, \"the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in \"Sacred Harp singing\", with annual conventions popping up in [[United States|all 50 states]] and in a number of European countries recently, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]] and [[Poland]], as well as in [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/|title=Sacred Harp Bremen|website=www.sacredharpbremen.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/|title=Welcome|last=Macadam|first=Edwin and Sheila|website=www.ukshapenote.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sacredharp86.org/|title=Sacred Harp in Poland {{!}} Polish Sacred Harp Community Website|website=sacredharp86.org|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref>[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/] Today \"Sacred Harp singing\" is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music.

This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.\n\nThe meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as \"87.87.87\", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short meter (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the \"D\" stands for double) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Children's Britannica\n|edition=Revised 3rd\n|volume=Volume 9\n|year=1981\n|pages=166\u2013167}}</ref>\n\nAlso, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn \"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\"), the meter is called Irregular.\n\n==Sikh hymnody==\n\nThe [[Sikh]] holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji ({{lang-pa| \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a42 \u0a17\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a70\u0a25 \u0a38\u0a3e\u0a39\u0a3f\u0a2c}} {{IPA-pa|\u0261\u028a\u027eu \u0261\u027e\u0259nt\u02b0 s\u0251h\u026ab}}), is a collection of hymns ([[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]]) or ''[[Gurbani]]''  describing the qualities of God<ref name=su>{{cite book\n | last = Penney\n | first = Sue\n | title = Sikhism\n | publisher = Heinemann\n | page = 14\n | isbn = 0-435-30470-4}}</ref> and why one should meditate on God's name.

The primary objects of study are matter and energy.  Physics is, in one sense, the oldest and most basic academic pursuit; its discoveries find applications throughout the [[natural science]]s, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into [[classical physics]] and [[modern physics]].\n\n== Ancient history ==\n{{further|History of astronomy}}\n\nElements of what became physics were drawn primarily from the fields of [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[mechanics]], which were methodologically united through the study of [[geometry]]. These mathematical disciplines began in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] with the [[Babylonia]]ns and with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] writers such as [[Archimedes]] and [[Ptolemy]]. [[Ancient philosophy]], meanwhile&nbsp;\u2013 including what was called \"[[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 focused on explaining nature through ideas such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotle#Causality, the four causes|four types of \"cause\"]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nThe move towards a rational understanding of nature began at least since the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in Greece (650\u2013480 [[BCE]]) with the [[Presocratics|Pre-Socratic philosophers]].  The philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed \"the Father of Science\" for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural [[phenomenon|phenomena]], proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.<ref>\"This shift from ecclesiastical reasoning to scientific reasoning marked the beginning of scientific methodology.\" Singer, C., ''A Short History of Science to the 19th Century'',  Streeter Press, 2008, p. 35.</ref> Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is [[Arche|the basic element]], experimenting with the attraction between [[magnet]]s and rubbed [[amber]] and formulating the first recorded [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]. [[Anaximander]], famous for his proto-[[evolution]]ary theory, disputed the Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, [[Heraclitus]] proposed that the only basic law governing the [[Universe]] was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation made him one of the first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of [[time]] in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The early physicist [[Leucippus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] first half of the 5th century BCE) adamantly opposed the idea of direct [[Divine providence|divine intervention]] in the universe, proposing instead that natural phenomena had a natural cause. Leucippus and his student [[Democritus]] were the first to develop the theory of [[atomism]], the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s.\n\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Aristotle]]<br/>(384\u2013322 [[BCE]])]]\n\nDuring the [[Classical Greece|classical period]] in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]], [[natural philosophy]] slowly developed into an exciting and contentious field of study. [[Aristotle]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s'') (384 \u2013 322 BCE), a student of [[Plato]], promoted the concept that observation of physical phenomena could ultimately lead to the discovery of the natural laws governing them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Aristotle's writings cover physics, [[metaphysics]], [[poetry]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], [[politics]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[ethics]], [[biology]] and [[zoology]]. He wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as \"Physics\"&nbsp;\u2013 in the 4th century BCE, Aristotle founded the system known as [[Aristotelian physics]]. He attempted to explain ideas such as [[motion (physics)|motion]] (and [[gravity]]) with the theory of [[classical elements|four elements]]. Aristotle believed that all matter was made up of aether, or some combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. According to Aristotle, these four terrestrial elements are capable of inter-transformation and move toward their natural place, so a stone falls downward toward the center of the cosmos, but flames rise upward toward the [[circumference]]. Eventually, [[Aristotelian physics]] became enormously popular for many centuries in Europe, informing the scientific and scholastic developments of the [[Middle Ages]]. It remained the mainstream scientific paradigm in Europe until the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nEarly in Classical Greece, knowledge that the Earth is [[Sphere|spherical]] (\"round\") was common. Around 240 BCE, as the result [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth's circumference|a seminal experiment]], [[Eratosthenes]] (276\u2013194 BCE) accurately estimated its circumference. In contrast to Aristotle's geocentric views, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] ({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2}}; c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) presented an explicit argument for a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], i.e. for placing the [[Sun]], not the [[Earth]], at its centre. [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a follower of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory, stated that [[Axial tilt|the Earth rotated around its own axis]], which, in turn, [[Orbit|revolved around]] the Sun. Though the arguments he used were lost, [[Plutarch]] stated that Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning.\n\n[[File:Domenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg|thumb|180x|The ancient Greek mathematician [[Archimedes]], famous for his ideas regarding [[fluid mechanics]] and [[buoyancy]].]]\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] ({{lang-el|[[wikt:\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2|\u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2]]}} (287\u2013212 BCE)&nbsp;\u2013 generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time&nbsp;\u2013 laid the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and calculated the underlying mathematics of the [[lever]]. A leading scientist of classical antiquity, Archimedes also developed elaborate systems of pulleys to move large objects with a minimum of effort. The [[Archimedes' screw]] underpins modern hydroengineering, and his machines of war helped to hold back the armies of Rome in the [[First Punic War]]. Archimedes even tore apart the arguments of Aristotle and his metaphysics, pointing out that it was impossible to separate mathematics and nature and proved it by converting mathematical theories into practical inventions. Furthermore, in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'', around 250 BCE, Archimedes developed the law of [[buoyancy]], also known as [[Archimedes' principle]]. In mathematics, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[pi]]. He also defined the [[Archimedean spiral|spiral bearing his name]], formulae for the [[volume]]s of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers. He also developed the principles of equilibrium states and [[center of mass|centers of gravity]], ideas that would influence the well known scholars, Galileo, and Newton.\n\n[[Hipparchus]] (190\u2013120 BCE), focusing on astronomy and mathematics, used sophisticated geometrical techniques to map the motion of the stars and [[planet]]s, even predicting the times that [[Solar eclipse]]s would happen. In addition, he added calculations of the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, based upon his improvements to the observational instruments used at that time. Another of the most famous of the early physicists was [[Ptolemy]] (90\u2013168 CE), one of the leading minds during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises, at least three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek, \u1f29 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"The Great Treatise\", originally \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, \"Mathematical Treatise\"). The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman world]].\n\nMuch of the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world was lost. Even of the works of the better known thinkers, few fragments survived. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, almost nothing of [[Hipparchus]]' direct work survived. Of the 150 reputed [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] works, only 30 exist, and some of those are \"little more than lecture notes\"{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}.\n\n===India and China===\n{{further|History of science and technology in China|History of Indian science and technology}}\n[[File:Hindu-arabic1.jpg|thumb|The Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

These philosophers believed that other elements (except ether) were physically palpable and hence comprised minuscule particles of matter. The last minuscule particle of matter that could not be subdivided further was termed [[Parmanu]]. These philosophers considered the atom to be indestructible and hence eternal. The Buddhists thought atoms to be minute objects unable to be seen to the naked eye that come into being and vanish in an instant. The [[Vaisheshika]] school of philosophers believed that an atom was a mere point in [[space]]. It was also first to depict relations between motion and force applied. Indian theories about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation. In [[Indian astronomy]], [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499 CE) proposed the [[Earth's rotation]], while [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444\u20131544) of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] proposed a semi-heliocentric model resembling the [[Tychonic system]].\n\nThe study of [[magnetism]] in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] dates back to the 4th century BCE.

[[Scholasticism|Scholastic European scholars]], who sought to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with [[Christian theology]], proclaimed Aristotle the greatest thinker of the ancient world. In cases where they didn't directly contradict the Bible, Aristotelian physics became the foundation for the physical explanations of the European Churches.  Quantification became a core element of medieval physics.<ref>Alistair C. Crombie, \"Quantification in medieval physics.\" ''Isis'' (1961): 143-160. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/228677 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nBased on Aristotelian physics, Scholastic physics described things as moving according to their essential nature. Celestial objects were described as moving in circles, because perfect circular motion was considered an innate property of objects that existed in the uncorrupted realm of the [[celestial spheres]]. The [[theory of impetus]], the ancestor to the concepts of [[inertia]] and [[momentum]], was developed along similar lines by [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] such as [[John Philoponus]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Motions below the lunar sphere were seen as imperfect, and thus could not be expected to exhibit consistent motion.  More idealized motion in the \"sublunary\" realm could only be achieved through [[Mechanics (Aristotle)|artifice]], and prior to the 17th century, many did not view artificial experiments as a valid means of learning about the natural world.  Physical explanations in the sublunary realm revolved around tendencies.  Stones contained the element earth, and earthly objects tended to move in a straight line toward the centre of the earth (and the universe in the Aristotelian geocentric view) unless otherwise prevented from doing so.<ref>David C.

Dissatisfaction with older philosophical approaches had begun earlier and had produced other changes in society, such as the [[Protestant Reformation]], but the revolution in science began when [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] began to mount a sustained attack on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophical programme and supposed that mathematical descriptive schemes adopted from such fields as mechanics and astronomy could actually yield universally valid characterizations of motion and other concepts.\n\n===Nicolaus Copernicus===\n{{main|Nicolaus Copernicus|Tycho Brahe|Johannes Kepler}}\n[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473\u20131543) is remembered for his development of a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the [[Solar system]].]]\nA breakthrough in [[astronomy]] was made by Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473\u20131543) when, in 1543, he gave strong arguments for the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the [[Solar system]], ostensibly as a means to render tables charting planetary motion more accurate and to simplify their production. In heliocentric models of the Solar system, the Earth orbits the Sun along with other bodies in [[Milky Way|Earth's]] [[galaxy]], a contradiction according to the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century CE; see above), [[Ptolemaic system|whose system]] placed the Earth at the center of the Universe and had been accepted for over 1,400 years. The Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (c.310&nbsp;\u2013 c.230 BCE) had suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but Copernicus' reasoning led to lasting general acceptance of this \"revolutionary\" idea. Copernicus' book presenting the theory (''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\") was published just before his death in 1543 and, as it is now generally considered to mark the beginning of modern astronomy, is also considered to mark the beginning of the Scientific revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Copernicus' new perspective, along with the accurate observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]], enabled German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571\u20131630) to formulate [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|his laws regarding planetary motion]] that remain in use today.\n\n===Galileo Galilei===\n{{main|Galileo Galilei}}\n[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], early proponent of the modern scientific worldview and method <br/>(1564\u20131642)]]\nThe Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) was the central figure in the Scientific revolution and famous for his support for Copernicanism, his astronomical discoveries, empirical experiments and his improvement of the telescope. As a mathematician, Galileo's role in the [[History of European research universities|university]] culture of his era was subordinated to the three major topics of study: [[law]], [[medicine]], and [[theology]] (which was closely allied to philosophy).  Galileo, however, felt that the descriptive content of the technical disciplines warranted philosophical interest, particularly because mathematical analysis of astronomical observations&nbsp;\u2013 notably, Copernicus' analysis of the [[relative motion]]s of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets&nbsp;\u2013 indicated that philosophers' statements about the nature of the universe could be shown to be in error.  Galileo also performed mechanical experiments, insisting that motion itself&nbsp;\u2013 regardless of whether it was produced \"naturally\" or \"artificially\" (i.e. deliberately)&nbsp;\u2013 had universally consistent characteristics that could be described mathematically.\n\nGalileo's early studies at the [[University of Pisa]] were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to mathematics and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, [[Galileo Galilei#Career as a scientist|subsequently, verified]]) the [[:wikt:isochronal|isochronal]] nature of the [[pendulum]] when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Pisa's cathedral]] and found that it remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's [[amplitude]]. He soon became known through his invention of a [[hydrostatic balance]] and for his treatise on the [[Center of mass#Center of gravity|center of gravity]] of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589\u201392), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their weights. The famous story in which Galileo is said to have [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped weights from]] the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] is apocryphal, but he did find that the [[Ballistic trajectory|path of a projectile]] is a [[parabola]] and is credited with conclusions that anticipated [[Newton's laws of motion]] (e.g. the notion of [[inertia]]).

Galileo also pursued applied science and technology, inventing, among other instruments, a military [[compass]]. His discovery of the Jovian moons [[Sidereus Nuncius|was published in 1610]] and enabled him to obtain the position of mathematician and philosopher to the [[Medici]] court.  As such, he was expected to engage in debates with philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition and received a large audience for his own publications such as the ''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences]]'' (published abroad following his arrest for the publication of ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'') and ''[[The Assayer]]''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Drake|1978}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Biagioli|1993}}</ref> Galileo's interest in experimenting with and formulating mathematical descriptions of motion established experimentation as an integral part of natural philosophy.  This tradition, combining with the non-mathematical emphasis on the collection of \"experimental histories\" by philosophical reformists such as [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] and [[Francis Bacon]], drew a significant following in the years leading up to and following Galileo's death, including [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and the participants in the [[Accademia del Cimento]] in Italy; [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] in France; [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the Netherlands; and [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]] in England.\n\n===Ren\u00e9 Descartes===\n{{main|Ren\u00e9 Descartes}}\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]<br/>(1596\u20131650)]]\nThe French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) was well-connected to, and influential within, the experimental philosophy networks of the day. Descartes had a more ambitious agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition altogether. Questioning the reality interpreted through the senses, Descartes sought to re-establish philosophical explanatory schemes by reducing all perceived phenomena to being attributable to the motion of an invisible sea of \"corpuscles\". (Notably, he reserved human thought and [[God]] from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, such as that of planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were merely different manifestations of an endless chain of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a [[vacuum]] could not exist), and his explanation of [[gravity]] in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shea|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1992}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Gaukroger|2002}}</ref>\n\nDescartes, like Galileo, was convinced of the importance of mathematical explanation, and he and his followers were key figures in the development of mathematics and geometry in the 17th century. Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] and the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, ''[[The Monadology]]''. Descartes has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy', and much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] \u2014 allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system \u2014 was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], important to the discovery of [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\n===Isaac Newton===\n{{main|Isaac Newton|History of classical mechanics}}\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]]<br/>(1642\u20131727)]]\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries saw the achievements of the greatest figure of the Scientific revolution: [[Cambridge University]] physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727), considered by many to be the greatest and most influential scientist who ever lived. Newton, a fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of England]], combined his own discoveries in mechanics and astronomy to earlier ones to create a single system for describing the workings of the universe. Newton formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] and the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], the latter of which could be used to explain the behavior not only of falling bodies on the earth but also planets and other celestial bodies. To arrive at his results, Newton invented one form of an entirely new branch of mathematics: [[calculus]] (also invented independently by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]), which was to become an essential tool in much of the later development in most branches of physics. Newton's findings were set forth in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), the publication of which in 1687 marked the beginning of the modern period of mechanics and astronomy.\n\nNewton was able to refute the Cartesian mechanical tradition that all motions should be explained with respect to the immediate force exerted by corpuscles. Using his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, Newton removed the idea that objects followed paths determined by natural shapes and instead demonstrated that not only regularly observed paths, but all the future motions of any body could be deduced mathematically based on knowledge of their existing motion, their [[mass]], and the [[force]]s acting upon them.  However, observed celestial motions did not precisely conform to a Newtonian treatment, and Newton, who was also deeply interested in [[theology]], imagined that God intervened to ensure the continued stability of the solar system.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]]<br/>(1646\u20131716)]]\n\nNewton's principles (but not his mathematical treatments) proved controversial with Continental philosophers, who found his lack of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanation for movement and gravitation philosophically unacceptable. Beginning around 1700, a bitter rift opened between the Continental and British philosophical traditions, which were stoked by heated, ongoing, and viciously personal disputes between the followers of Newton and Leibniz concerning priority over the analytical techniques of [[calculus]], which each had developed independently. Initially, the Cartesian and Leibnizian traditions prevailed on the Continent (leading to the dominance of the Leibnizian calculus notation everywhere except Britain).  Newton himself remained privately disturbed at the lack of a philosophical understanding of gravitation while insisting in his writings that none was necessary to infer its reality.  As the 18th century progressed, Continental natural philosophers increasingly accepted the Newtonians' willingness to forgo [[Ontology|ontological]] metaphysical explanations for mathematically described motions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hall|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Bertolini Meli|1993}}</ref><ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\">{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1999}}</ref>\n\nNewton built the first functioning [[reflecting telescope]]<ref name=\"The Early Period (1608\u20131672)\">{{vcite web |url=http://etoile.berkeley.edu/~jrg/TelescopeHistory/Early_Period.html |title=The Early Period (1608\u20131672) |accessdate=3 February 2009 |publisher=James R.

While Newton explained light as being composed of tiny particles, a rival theory of light which explained its behavior in terms of waves was presented in 1690 by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. However, the belief in the mechanistic philosophy coupled with Newton's reputation meant that the wave theory saw relatively little support until the 19th century. Newton also formulated [[Newton's law of cooling|an empirical law of cooling]], studied the [[speed of sound]], investigated [[power series]], demonstrated the [[Binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]] and developed [[Newton's method|a method]] for approximating the [[Root of a function|roots of a function]]. His work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.<ref>{{citation |last1=B\u0142aszczyk |first1=Piotr |author1-link= |last2=Katz |first2=Mikhail |author2-link=Mikhail Katz |last3=Sherry |first3=David |author3-link= |arxiv=1202.4153 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 |issue= |journal=[[Foundations of Science]] |pages= |title=Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking |volume= |year=2012}}</ref> Most importantly, Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, which were neither capricious nor malevolent. By demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his own theory of gravitation, Newton also removed the last doubts about heliocentrism. By bringing together all the ideas set forth during the Scientific revolution, Newton effectively established the foundation for modern society in mathematics and science.\n\n===Other achievements===\nOther branches of physics also received attention during the period of the Scientific revolution. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], court physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627\u201391) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the [[Boyle's law|gas law named for him]]; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the [[Royal Society of England]] (1660) and the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences in France]] (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as [[John Wallis]], [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]], [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[John Mayow]], and [[Christopher Wren]] (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, [[James Bernoulli]] showed that the [[cycloid]] is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, [[Johann Bernoulli]] showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a [[catenary]], the curve with the lowest possible [[center of gravity]] available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the [[brachistochrone]] problem.\n\n====Early thermodynamics====\nA precursor of the engine was designed by the German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, designed and built the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and created the world's first ever [[vacuum]] known as the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment.  He was driven to make a vacuum to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that [[Horror vacui (physics)|'Nature abhors a vacuum']]. Shortly thereafter, Irish physicist and chemist Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation for a gas: ''PV'' = ''k'', where ''P'' is [[pressure]], ''V'' is [[volume]] and ''k'' is a constant: this relationship is known as [[Boyle's Law]]. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive [[Gay-Lussac's law|his law]], which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. Hence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[Watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 18th-century developments ==\n[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Alessandro Volta]]<br/>(1745\u20131827)]]\nDuring the 18th century, the mechanics founded by Newton was developed by several scientists as more mathematicians learned calculus and elaborated upon its initial formulation. The application of mathematical analysis to problems of motion was known as rational mechanics, or mixed mathematics (and was later termed [[classical mechanics]]).\n\n===Mechanics===\n[[File:Danielbernoulli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]<br/>(1700\u20131782)]]\nIn 1714, [[Brook Taylor]] derived the [[fundamental frequency]] of a stretched vibrating string in terms of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a [[differential equation]]. The Swiss mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700\u20131782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Darrigol|2005}}</ref> In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the fundamental frequency and [[harmonic]]s of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of [[fluid dynamics]] and his examination of [[fluid]] flow was introduced in his 1738 work ''[[Hydrodynamica]]''.\n\nRational mechanics dealt primarily with the development of elaborate mathematical treatments of observed motions, using Newtonian principles as a basis, and emphasized improving the tractability of complex calculations and developing of legitimate means of analytical approximation. A representative contemporary textbook was published by [[Johann Baptiste Horvath]]. By the end of the century analytical treatments were rigorous enough to verify the stability of the [[solar system]] solely on the basis of Newton's laws without reference to divine intervention\u2014even as deterministic treatments of systems as simple as the [[n-body problem|three body problem]] in gravitation remained intractable.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bos|1980}}</ref> In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] predicted the periodicity of [[Halley's Comet]], [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, and [[Henry Cavendish]] measured the [[gravitational constant]] and determined the mass of the Earth in 1798. In 1783, [[John Michell]] suggested that some objects might be so massive that not even light could escape from them.\n\nIn 1739, [[Leonhard Euler]] solved the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, [[Colin Maclaurin]] discovered his [[Maclaurin spheroid|uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids]]. In 1742, Benjamin Robins published his ''New Principles in Gunnery'', establishing the science of aerodynamics. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]. In 1743, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published his ''Traite de Dynamique'', in which he introduced the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints, and applied the new idea of [[virtual work]] to solve dynamical problem, now known as [[D'Alembert's principle]], as a rival to Newton's second law of motion. In 1747, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the Bessel function solutions. In 1776, [[John Smeaton]] published a paper on experiments relating power, [[work (physics)|work]], [[momentum]] and [[kinetic energy]], and supporting the [[conservation of energy]]. In 1788, Joseph Louis Lagrange presented [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations of motion]] in ''M\u00e9canique Analytique'', in which the whole of mechanics was organized around the principle of virtual work. In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] states the law of [[conservation of mass]]. The rational mechanics developed in the 18th century received a brilliant exposition in both Lagrange's 1788 work and the ''Celestial Mechanics'' (1799\u20131825) of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nDuring the 18th century, thermodynamics was developed through the theories of weightless [[imponderable fluid|\"imponderable fluids\"]], such as heat (\"caloric\"), [[history of electricity|electricity]], and [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]] (which was rapidly overthrown as a concept following [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] identification of [[oxygen]] gas late in the century).  Assuming that these concepts were real fluids, their flow could be traced through a mechanical apparatus or chemical reactions.  This tradition of experimentation led to the development of new kinds of experimental apparatus, such as the [[Leyden Jar]]; and new kinds of measuring instruments, such as the [[calorimeter]], and improved versions of old ones, such as the [[thermometer]].  Experiments also produced new concepts, such as the [[University of Glasgow]] experimenter [[Joseph Black]]'s notion of [[latent heat]] and Philadelphia intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s characterization of electrical fluid as flowing between places of excess and deficit (a concept later reinterpreted in terms of positive and negative [[electric charge|charges]]). Franklin also showed that lightning is electricity in 1752.\n\nThe accepted theory of heat in the 18th century viewed it as a kind of fluid, called [[caloric theory|caloric]]; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including [[Joseph Black]] (1728\u201399) and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]), who found a direct relationship between heat and mechanical energy.\n\nWhile it was recognized early in the 18th century that finding absolute theories of electrostatic and magnetic force akin to Newton's principles of motion would be an important achievement, none were forthcoming.  This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined in the early years of the 19th century in places such as the newly established [[Royal Institution]] in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]]'s analytical treatment of the flow of heat, as published in 1822.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heilbron|1979}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Golinski|1999}}</ref> [[Joseph Priestley]] proposed an electrical inverse-square law in 1767, and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] introduced the inverse-square law of [[electrostatics]] in 1798.\n\nAt the end of the century, the members of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] had attained clear dominance in the field.<ref name=\"Guicciardini1999\" /><ref>{{Harvtxt|Greenberg|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Guicciardini|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Garber|1999}}</ref> At the same time, the experimental tradition established by Galileo and his followers persisted.  The [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] were major centers for the performance and reporting of experimental work. Experiments in mechanics, optics, [[magnetism]], [[static electricity]], [[history of chemistry|chemistry]], and [[physiology]] were not clearly distinguished from each other during the 18th century, but significant differences in explanatory schemes and, thus, experiment design were emerging.  Chemical experimenters, for instance, defied attempts to enforce a scheme of abstract Newtonian forces onto chemical affiliations, and instead focused on the isolation and classification of chemical substances and reactions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ben-Chaim|2004}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 19th century ==\n[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]]<br/>(1791\u20131867)]]\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the electric battery (known of the [[voltaic pile]]) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] demonstrated the wave nature of light\u2014which received strong experimental support from the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]\u2014and the principle of interference. In 1813, [[Peter Ewart]] supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper ''On the measure of moving force''. In 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after \u00d8rsted's discovery reached France, [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, [[Michael Faraday]] built an electricity-powered motor, while [[Georg Ohm]] stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] discovered [[Brownian motion]]: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid.  In 1829, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] introduced the terms of [[Work (physics)|work]] (force times distance) and [[kinetic energy]] with the meanings they have today.\n\nIn 1831, Faraday (and independently [[Joseph Henry]]) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism&nbsp;\u2013 known as [[Faraday's law of induction|electromagnetic induction]]; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the [[Jacobi ellipsoid]]). In 1834, [[John Scott Russell|John Russell]] observed a nondecaying solitary water wave ([[soliton]]) in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] near [[Edinburgh]] and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's canonical equations of motion]]. In the same year, [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis|Gaspard Coriolis]] examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the [[Coriolis effect]]. In 1841, [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], an [[amateur]] scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, [[Christian Doppler]] proposed the [[Doppler effect]]. In 1847, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] showed the Earth's rotation with a huge [[pendulum]] ([[Foucault pendulum]]).\n\nThere were important advances in [[continuum mechanics]] in the first half of the century, namely formulation of [[elastic modulus|laws of elasticity]] for solids and discovery of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for fluids.\n\n===Laws of thermodynamics===\n{{further|History of thermodynamics}}\n\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|right|{{nowrap|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]<br/>(1824\u20131907)}}]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] and [[James Prescott Joule]], who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]\u2014a restatement of the [[law of conservation of energy]]\u2014which was stated around 1850 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later known as Lord Kelvin, and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of [[Lazare Carnot]], Sadi Carnot, and [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]]\u2013as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work\u2014to formulate the first law.\n\nKelvin and Clausius also stated the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]'s influential work ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy'') and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] measured the [[speed of light]] in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]] or Joule\u2013Kelvin effect. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] puts forward the idea of the [[heat death of the universe]] in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of ''dQ/T'' ([[Clausius's theorem]]) (though he did not yet name the quantity).\n\n===Statistical mechanics (a fundamentally new approach to science)===\n{{further|History of statistical mechanics}}\n\n\n[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|180px|left|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]<br/>(1831\u20131879)]]\n\nIn 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|distribution law of molecular velocities]]. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]]. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.\n\nThe prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a \"[[Luminiferous aether|luminiferous ether]]\", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s 1888 detection of [[electromagnetic radiation]], was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|JungnickelMcCormmach|1986}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hunt|1991}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchwald|1994}}</ref> Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices.

Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"[[entropy]]\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"[[Maxwell's demon]]\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|Wise|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1998}}</ref> In 1902, [[James Jeans]] found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== 20th century: birth of modern physics ==\n<!-- [[Template:Modern physics]] links here -->\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]]<br/>(1867\u20131934)]]\n{{see also|Modern physics}}\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, physics had evolved to the point at which [[classical mechanics]] could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories\u2014the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear\u2014and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in [[blackbody radiation]] and the [[photoelectric effect]], while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Emil Cohn]], [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] believed that some modification of [[Maxwell's equations]] might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of [[classical physics]] were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as [[modern physics]].<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Agar|2012\">{{Harvtxt|Agar|2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radiation experiments===\n[[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|200px|[[J. J. Thomson]] (1856\u20131940) discovered the [[electron]] and [[Isotope|isotopy]] and also invented the [[mass spectrometer]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1906.]]\nIn the 19th century, experimenters began to detect unexpected forms of radiation: [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] caused a sensation with his discovery of [[X-ray]]s in 1895; in 1896 [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that certain kinds of matter emit radiation on their own accord. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]], and new radioactive elements found by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] raised questions about the supposedly indestructible atom and the nature of matter. Marie and Pierre coined the term \"[[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]\" to describe this property of matter, and isolated the radioactive elements [[radium]] and [[polonium]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] identified two of Becquerel's forms of radiation with electrons and the element [[helium]]. Rutherford identified and named two types of radioactivity and in 1911 interpreted experimental evidence as showing that the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Classical theory, however, predicted that this structure should be unstable. Classical theory had also failed to explain successfully two other experimental results that appeared in the late 19th century. One of these was the demonstration by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]]\u2014known as the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]\u2014which showed there did not seem to be a preferred frame of reference, at rest with respect to the hypothetical [[luminiferous ether]], for describing electromagnetic phenomena. Studies of radiation and radioactive decay continued to be a preeminent focus for physical and chemical research through the 1930s, when the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] opened the way to the practical exploitation of what came to be called [[Nuclear power|\"atomic\" energy]].\n\n===Albert Einstein's theory of relativity===\nIn 1905 a young, 26-year-old German physicist (then a Bern patent clerk) named [[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955), showed how measurements of time and space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. To say that Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science is no exaggeration. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the [[theory of relativity]] alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is constant, i.e. the same for all observers,  and an absolute physical boundary for motion. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, which expresses the [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].\n\n====Special relativity====\n{{further|History of special relativity}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|<!--Refining/rephrasing?:-->[[Albert Einstein]] (1879\u20131955) proposed that [[gravitation]] was a result of [[mass]]es (or their [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|equivalent energies]]) [[Curvature of spacetime|curving (\"bending\")]] the [[spacetime]] in which they exist, altering the paths they follow within it.]]\n\nEinstein argued that the speed of light was a constant in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frames]] and that electromagnetic laws should remain valid independent of reference frame\u2014assertions which rendered the ether \"superfluous\" to physical theory, and that held that observations of time and length varied relative to how the observer was moving with respect to the object being measured (what came to be called the \"[[special relativity|special theory of relativity]]\").  It also followed that mass and energy were interchangeable quantities according to the equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>]].  In another paper published the same year, Einstein asserted that electromagnetic radiation was transmitted in discrete quantities (\"[[Quantum|quanta]]\"), according to a constant that the theoretical physicist [[Max Planck]] had posited in 1900 to arrive at an accurate theory for the distribution of [[blackbody radiation]]\u2014an assumption that explained the strange properties of the [[photoelectric effect]].\n\nThe special theory of relativity is a formulation of the relationship between physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying \"ether\" and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment. Einstein demolished these questions and the ether concept in his special theory of relativity. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: \"What is time?\" Newton, in the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: \"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration.\" This definition is basic to all classical physics.\n\nEinstein had the genius to question it, and found that it was incomplete. Instead, each \"observer\" necessarily makes use of his or her own scale of time, and for two observers in relative motion, their time-scales will differ. This induces a related effect on position measurements. Space and time become intertwined concepts, fundamentally dependent on the observer. Each observer presides over his or her own space-time framework or coordinate system. There being no absolute frame of reference, all observers of given events make different but equally valid (and reconcilable) measurements.  What remains absolute is stated in Einstein's relativity postulate: \"The basic laws of physics are identical for two observers who have a constant relative velocity with respect to each other.\"\n\nSpecial Relativity had a profound effect on physics: started as a rethinking of the theory of electromagnetism, it found a new [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry law]] of nature, now called ''[[Poincar\u00e9 symmetry]]'', that replaced the old Galilean (see [[#Galileo Galilei|above]]) symmetry.\n\nSpecial Relativity exerted another long-lasting effect on [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]]. Although initially it was credited with the \"unification of mass and energy\", it became evident that [[relativistic dynamics]] established a firm ''distinction'' between [[rest mass]], which is an invariant (observer independent) property of a [[particle]] or system of particles, and the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of a system.  The latter two are separately [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] in all situations but not invariant with respect to different observers. The term ''[[mass]]'' in [[particle physics]] underwent a [[semantic change]], and since the late 20th century it almost exclusively denotes the [[invariant mass|rest (or ''invariant'') mass]]. See [[mass in special relativity]] for additional discussion.\n\n====General relativity====\n{{further|History of general relativity}}\nBy 1916, Einstein was able to generalize this further, to deal with all states of motion including non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] \u2014 a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.\n\nThe gradual acceptance of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of [[Niels Bohr's model of the atom]] created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles.  Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the \"[[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]\") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading to the conclusion that space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as [[gravitational lens]]ing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n{{further|History of quantum mechanics}}\n[[File:Max Planck 1878.GIF|thumb|180px|right|[[Max Planck]]<br/>(1858\u20131947)]]\nAlthough relativity resolved the electromagnetic phenomena conflict demonstrated by Michelson and Morley, a second theoretical problem was the explanation of the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]]; experiment showed that at shorter wavelengths, toward the ultraviolet end of the spectrum, the energy approached zero, but classical theory predicted it should become infinite. This glaring discrepancy, known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], was solved by the new theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics is the theory of [[atom]]s and subatomic systems. Approximately the first 30 years of the 20th century represent the time of the conception and evolution of the theory. The basic ideas of quantum theory were introduced in 1900 by [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1918 for his discovery of the quantified nature of energy. The quantum theory (which previously relied in the \"correspondence\" at large scales between the quantized world of the atom and the continuities of the \"[[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical]]\" world) was accepted when the [[Compton Effect]] established that light carries momentum and can scatter off particles, and when [[Louis de Broglie]] asserted that matter can be seen as behaving as a wave in much the same way as electromagnetic waves behave like particles ([[wave\u2013particle duality]]).\n\n[[File:Heisenberg 10.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Werner Heisenberg]]<br/>(1901\u20131976)]]\n\nIn 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] used the same constant to explain the stability of [[Rutherford model|Rutherford's atom]] as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in [[Matrix mechanics|matrix-form]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of [[causality]]. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Paul Dirac]], and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"[[uncertainty principle]]\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and [[momentum]]) and the \"[[Copenhagen interpretation]]\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\".<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\">{{Harvtxt|Kragh|1999}}</ref> The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]]'s work on [[photon]]s and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]], the theory of the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n\n{{anchor|spin\u2013statistics}} The [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]] established that any particle in quantum mechanics may be either a [[boson]] (statistically Bose\u2013Einstein) or a [[fermion]] (statistically [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Fermi\u2013Dirac]]). It was later found that all [[Elementary particle|fundamental]] bosons transmit forces, such as the photon that transmits electromagnetism.\n\nFermions are particles \"like electrons and nucleons\" and are the usual constituents of [[matter]]. Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics later found numerous other uses, from astrophysics (see [[Degenerate matter]]) to [[semiconductor]] design.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Contemporary and particle physics ==\n{{further|History of subatomic physics|List of unsolved problems in physics}}\n\n===Quantum field theory===\n[[File:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|right|A [[Feynman diagram]] representing (left to right) the production of a photon (blue [[sine wave]]) from the [[annihilation]] of an electron and its complementary [[antiparticle]], the [[positron]].

However, attempts to quantize electromagnetic theory entirely were stymied throughout the 1930s by theoretical formulations yielding infinite energies. This situation was not considered adequately resolved until after [[World War&nbsp;II]] ended, when [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] independently posited the technique of [[renormalization]], which allowed for an establishment of a robust [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schweber|1994}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, new theories of [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]] proliferated with the rise of the idea of the [[Quantum field theory|quantization of fields]] through \"[[Exchange interaction|exchange forces]]\" regulated by an exchange of short-lived [[Virtual particle|\"virtual\" particle]]s, which were allowed to exist according to the laws governing the uncertainties inherent in the quantum world. Notably, [[Hideki Yukawa]] proposed that the positive charges of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were kept together courtesy of a powerful but short-range force mediated by a particle with a mass between that of the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. This particle, the \"[[pion]]\", was identified in 1947 as part of what became a slew of particles discovered after World War II. Initially, such particles were found as [[Ionization|ionizing radiation]] left by [[cosmic ray]]s, but increasingly came to be produced in newer and more powerful [[particle accelerator]]s.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Galison|1997}}</ref>\n\nOutside particle physics, significant advances of the time were:\n* the invention of the [[laser]] (1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]);\n* the theoretical and experimental research of [[superconductivity]], especially the invention of a [[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory|quantum theory of superconductivity]] by [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and [[Lev Landau]] (1962 Nobel Prize in Physics) and, later, its explanation via [[Cooper pair]]s (1972 Nobel Prize in Physics). The Cooper pair was an early example of [[quasiparticle]]s.\n\n===Unified field theories===\n{{main|Unified field theory}}\nEinstein deemed that all [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature can be explained in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to \"merge\" several interactions. One of formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a ''[[gauge theory]]'', a generalization of the idea of symmetry. Eventually the [[Standard Model]] (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify [[gravitation]] with something else failed.\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Standard Model===\n{{main|Standard Model}}\n[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe interaction of these particles by [[scattering]] and [[Particle decay|decay]] provided a key to new fundamental quantum theories. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Yuval Ne'eman]] brought some order to these new particles by classifying them according to certain qualities, beginning with what Gell-Mann referred to as the \"[[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]\". While its further development, the [[quark model]], at first seemed inadequate to describe [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]], allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the [[S-Matrix]], the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]] in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"[[Standard Model|standard model]]\" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for [[gravitation]], and which remains generally accepted within its domain of application.<ref name=\"Harvtxt|Kragh|1999\"/>\n\nThe Standard Model groups the [[electroweak interaction]] theory and [[quantum chromodynamics]] into a structure denoted by the [[gauge group]] SU(3)&times;SU(2)&times;U(1).

They are similar in appearance and purpose to [[aerofoil]]s used by [[aeroplane]]s. [[Boat]]s that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and allowing greater speeds.\n\n==Description==\nThe hydrofoil usually consists of a [[wing]] like structure mounted on [[strut]]s below the [[hull (ship)|hull]], or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats (see illustration). As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull(s) develop enough [[lift (force)|lift]] to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull [[drag (physics)|drag]]. This provides a corresponding increase in [[speed]] and [[fuel efficiency]].\n\nWider adoption of hydrofoils is prevented by the increased complexity of building and maintaining them. Hydrofoils are generally prohibitively more expensive than conventional watercraft above the certain displacement, so most hydrofoil craft are relatively small, and are mainly used as high-speed passenger ferries, where the relatively high passenger fees can offset the high cost of the craft itself. However, the design is simple enough that there are many [[human-powered hydrofoil]] designs. Amateur experimentation and development of the concept is popular.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hydrofoil+design&search=Search&gl=CA&hl=en|title=hydrofoil design - YouTube|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Hydrodynamic mechanics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Hydrofoil types.svg|450px|thumb|The two types of hydrofoils: surface-piercing and fully submerged]]\n\nSince air and water are governed by similar [[fluid dynamics|fluid equations]]\u2014albeit with different levels of [[viscosity]], [[density]], and [[compressible flow|compressibility]]\u2014the hydrofoil and [[airfoil]] (both types of [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]]) create [[lift (force)|lift]] in identical ways. The foil shape moves smoothly through the water, deflecting the flow downward, which, following the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], exerts an upward force on the foil.  This turning of the water creates higher pressure on the bottom of the foil and reduced pressure on the top. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via [[Bernoulli's principle]], so the resulting flowfield about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.\n\nWhen used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed. The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft, reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water but remains in equilibrium. Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of [[drag (physics)]] on the hull are eliminated as the hull lifts clear, turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil, and decreasingly on the hull, creating a marked increase in speed.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://web.mit.edu/2.972/www/reports/hydrofoil/hydrofoil.html\n | title =Hydrofoils\n | last =Rosado\n | first =Tina\n | date =1999\n | website =Reports on How Things Work\n | publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n | access-date =11 December 2016\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\n===Foil configurations===\nEarly hydrofoils used V-shaped foils. Hydrofoils of this type are known as \"surface-piercing\" since portions of the V-shape hydrofoils rise above the water surface when foilborne. Some modern hydrofoils use fully submerged inverted T-shape foils. Fully submerged hydrofoils are less subject to the effects of wave action, and, therefore, more stable at sea and more comfortable for crew and passengers. This type of configuration, however, is not self-stabilizing. The [[angle of attack]] on the hydrofoils must be adjusted continuously to changing conditions, a control process performed by sensors, a computer, and active surfaces.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Forlanini Idroplano-Forlani Hydrofoil 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Enrico Forlanini|Forlanini's]] hydrofoil over [[Lake Maggiore]], 1906]]\n\n=== Prototypes ===\n\nItalian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] began work on hydrofoils in 1898 and used a \"ladder\" foil system.

Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement, and after reading the article began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. With his chief engineer [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Casey Baldwin]], Bell began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models based on those designs, which led to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. During Bell's world tour of 1910\u20131911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.\n\nOn returning to Bell's large laboratory at his [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in Bell's ''[[HD-4]]''. Using [[Renault]] engines, a top speed of {{convert|87|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on}} was achieved, accelerating rapidly, taking waves without difficulty, steering well and showing good stability. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy]] permitted him to obtain two 260&nbsp;kW (350&nbsp;hp) engines. On 9 September 1919 the ''HD-4'' set a world marine speed record of {{convert|114|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on}}, which stood for two decades.<ref name=\"canada encyclopedia\">{{Cite web |title=Hydrofoil |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/hydrofoil |publisher=Historica Canada |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}</ref> A full-scale replica of the ''HD-4'' is viewable at the [[Alexander Graham Bell#Legacy and honors|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]] museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn the early 1950s an English couple built the ''White Hawk'', a jet-powered hydrofoil water craft, in an attempt to beat the absolute water speed record.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8NsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S8Q4T9XAH8aygwe0k-nnBQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Jet Hydrofoil Shoots At World Record\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1953, pp. 70-71</ref> However, in tests, ''White Hawk'' could barely top the record breaking speed of the 1919 ''HD-4''.

After the war, the Russians captured Schertel's team. As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats, Schertel went to [[Switzerland]], where he established the Supramar company. In 1952, Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil, PT10 \"Freccia d'Oro\" (Golden Arrow), in Lake Maggiore, between Switzerland and [[Italy]]. The PT10 is of surface-piercing type, it can carry 32 passengers and travel at {{convert|35|kn|km/h mph}}. In 1968, the Bahraini born banker [[Hussain Najadi]] acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Norway and the US. [[General Dynamics]] of the United States became its licensee, and the Pentagon awarded its first R&D naval research project in the field of [[supercavitation]]. [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] Shipbuilding of Osaka, Japan, was another licensee of Supramar, as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1971, Supramar designed many models of hydrofoils: PT20, PT50, PT75, PT100 and PT150. All are of surface-piercing type, except the PT150 combining a surface-piercing foil forward with a fully submerged foil in the aft location. Over 200 of Supramar's design were built, most of them by Rodriquez in [[Sicily]], Italy.\n\nDuring the same period the [[Soviet Union]] experimented extensively with hydrofoils, constructing hydrofoil river boats and [[ferries]] with streamlined designs during the cold war period and into the 1980s. Such vessels include the [[Raketa (hydrofoil)|Raketa]] (1957) type, followed by the larger [[Meteor (hydrofoil)|Meteor]] type and the smaller [[Voskhod (hydrofoil)|Voskhod]] type. One of the most successful Soviet designer/inventor in this area was [[Rostislav Alexeyev]], who some consider the 'father' of the modern hydrofoil due to his 1950s era high speed hydrofoil designs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Later, circa 1970s, Alexeyev combined his hydrofoil experience with the [[Ground effect in aircraft|surface effect]] principle to create the [[Ekranoplan]].\n\nIn 1961, [[SRI International]] issued a study on \"The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in US Domestic and Foreign Commerce\".<ref name=\"Feasibility\">{{cite web |title = The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in U.S. Domestic and Foreign Commerce.|author = [[SRI International]]|url = http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/00026416.html|year = 1961|accessdate = 9 September 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120301104231/http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/repository/record/tris/00026416.html|archive-date = 1 March 2012}}</ref> Commercial use of hydrofoils in the US first appeared in 1961 when two commuter vessels were commissioned by [[Harry Gale Nye, Jr.]]'s North American Hydrofoils to service the route from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey to the financial district of Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web| title=Enterprise| author=[http://www.foils.org/ foils.org]| url=http://www.foils.org/gallery/enterpr.htm| accessdate=9 September 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428050743/http://www.foils.org/gallery/enterpr.htm| archivedate=28 April 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Military usage==\n[[File:BTK pr.206M2.jpg|thumb|A Project 206M \"Shtorm\" (NATO: ''Turya'' class) patrol fast attack craft hydrofoil of the [[Cuban Navy]].]]\n[[File:Sparviero DN-ST-84-03940.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aerial port beam view of the Italian Sparviero class hydrofoil-missile NIBBIO P-421 underway.]]\n[[File:PHM-4.jpg|thumb|[[USS Aquila (PHM-4)|USS ''Aquila'']], a military hydrofoil.

The forward two foil assemblies of what is believed to be the latter hydrofoil were salvaged in the mid-1960s from a derelict hulk in Baddeck, Nova Scotia by Colin MacGregor Stevens. These were donated to the Maritime Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Armed Forces]] built and tested a number of hydrofoils (e.g., Baddeck and two vessels named ''Bras d'Or''), which culminated in the high-speed anti-submarine hydrofoil [[HMCS Bras d'Or (FHE 400)|HMCS ''Bras d'Or'']] in the late 1960s. However, the program was cancelled in the early 1970s due to a shift away from [[anti-submarine warfare]] by the Canadian military.

Since then there has been a steady decline in their use and popularity for leisure, military and commercial passenger transport use.  There are a number of reasons for this:\n\n* Hydrofoils are sensitive to impacts with floating objects and marine animals. On hitting something, a hydrofoil boat may fall off the foils, which often creates a perception of increased danger. However, hydrofoils operating in Hong Kong, reportedly some of the most littered waters, operate relatively trouble free. The Hong Kong Marine department maintains online records of all accidents in its waters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mardep.gov.hk/en/publication/ereport.html|title=Summaries of Marine Accident Investigation|website=www.mardep.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>\n* Hydrofoils have sharp edges that reside in the water while in operation. These edges can fatally injure marine animals (e.g., whales).\n*  Hydrofoils are expensive to build. A vessel like the Boeing Jetfoil currently costs about three times the price of an equivalent catamaran passenger ferry. The increased costs are not always economically justifiable by consumers.  Simpler designs such as those of Russian design and those by Rodriquez in Italy are more competitive in price and are still being produced today for operation on ferry routes.\n* It is a very conservative industry. Hydrofoils are still considered exotic by many commercial operators of high-speed craft and many will not risk trying such exotic vessels when they have no experience in operating them. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Those that do have found benefit in their operation.<ref name=\"Feasibility\"/>\n* They are technically complex and require high maintenance, which has put an end to most military hydrofoil projects. The US Navy, for example, developed some of the most technically advanced hydrofoils, but could not make the complex propulsion systems and ride control reliable. This eventually led to the suspension of their hydrofoil projects.  Most other Navy developments met the same fate. The Russian Navy still operates very large hydrofoils and have been successful\u2014largely because they opted for simpler systems that might not have the same performance as the US designs but are more robust and reliable.  In Hong Kong, increasing maintenance cost of keeping the old jetfoils running is resulting in these vessels slowly being phased out.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col |colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Boeing hydrofoils]]\n* [[Disco Volante (ship)]]\n* [[Flyak]] &ndash; a hydrofoil kayak\n* [[Foilboard]]\n* ''[[The Hydrofoil Mystery]]'' &ndash; historical fiction\n* [[Planing (sailing)]]\n* [[Raketa (hydrofoil)]]\n* [[Riverboat]]\n* [[Sailing hydrofoil]]\n* [[Sit-down hydrofoil]]\n* [[Supercavitation]]\n* [[Trampofoil]] &ndash; a one-person human-powered hydrofoil\n* [[Voskhod (hydrofoil)]]\n* [[LISA Akoya]] &ndash; amphibious plane with hydrofoil assisted takeoff\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|hydrofoil}}\n{{commons category|Hydrofoils}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/hydrofoil-limits.htm Limitations of hydrofoils]\n* [http://foils.org The International Hydrofoil Society]\n* [http://www.hysucraft.com Fast CC Hydrofoil design by Prof. KG Hoppe, inventor of HYSUCAT technology patented by University of Stellenbosch, S.A.]\n* [http://www.hawctech.com Hydrofoil Assisted Water Craft employing HYSUCAT and HYSUWAC patents in their projects and vessels currently in operation]\n* [http://www.hysucat.co.za Hysucat Design, South African originators of Hydrofoil Supported Catamaran technology]\n* [http://www.hydrofoils.ch Swiss experimental hydrofoils]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100605014428/http://hyraii.ethz.ch/ HyRaii - Hydrofoil Sailboat, Student Project ETH Zurich]\n\n{{Public transport|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hydrofoils|*]]\n[[Category:Nautical terminology]]\n[[Category:English inventions]]", "sha1": "i60mblvas6plhdn4c5an4esrd4dzbi2"}}, {"title": "Henri Chopin", "ns": "0", "id": "13763", "revision": {"id": "855166898", "parentid": "818773841", "timestamp": "2018-08-16T11:39:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mueckn", "id": "27660196"}, "minor": "", "comment": "added details for one reference - *Matter, Marc. 2014. \"Revue OU Disque\" (Editorial).

Both his siblings died during the war. One was shot by a German soldier the day after an armistice was declared in Paris, the other while sabotaging a train {{harv|Acquaviva|2008}}.\n\nChopin was a French practitioner of [[concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[sound poetry]], well known throughout the second half of the 20th century. His work, though iconoclastic, remained well within the historical spectrum of poetry as it moved from a spoken tradition to the printed word and now back to the spoken word again {{harv|Wendt|1996|loc=112}}. He created a large body of pioneering recordings using early tape recorders, studio technologies and the sounds of the manipulated human voice. His emphasis on sound is a reminder that language stems as much from oral traditions as from classic literature, of the relationship of balance between order and chaos.\n\nChopin is significant above all for his diverse spread of creative achievement, as well as for his position as a focal point of contact for the international arts. As poet, painter, graphic artist and designer, typographer, independent publisher, filmmaker, broadcaster and arts promoter, Chopin's work is a barometer of the shifts in European media between the 1950s and the 1970s.\n\nIn 1966 he was with [[Gustav Metzger]], [[Otto Muehl]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Peter Weibel]] and others a participant of the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] (''DIAS'') in London {{harv| Solodyankina|2015}}.\n\nIn 1964 he created ''OU'', one of the most notable reviews of the second half of the 20th century, and he ran it until 1974. ''OU'''s contributors included [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[Gil J Wolman]], Fran\u00e7ois Dufr\u00eane, [[Bernard Heidsieck]], John Furnival, Tom Phillips, and the Austrian sculptor, writer and [[Dada]] pioneer [[Raoul Hausmann]].\n\nHis books included ''Le Dernier Roman du Monde'' (1971), ''Portrait des 9'' (1975), ''The Cosmographical Lobster'' (1976), ''[[Po\u00e9sie Sonore Internationale]]'' (1979), ''Les Riches Heures de l'Alphabet'' (1992) and ''[[Graphpoemesmachine]]'' (2006). Henri also created many graphic works on his typewriter: the typewriter poems (also known as dactylopo\u00e8mes) feature in international art collections such as those of Francesco Conz in Verona, the Morra Foundation in Naples and Ruth and Marvin Sackner in Miami, and have been the subject of Australian, British and French retrospectives {{harv|Acquaviva|2008}}.\n\nHis publication and design of the classic audio-visual magazines ''Cinqui\u00e8me Saison'' and ''OU'' between 1958 and 1974, each issue containing recordings as well as texts, images, screenprints and multiples, brought together international contemporary writers and artists such as members of [[Lettrisme]] and [[Fluxus]], [[Jiri Kolar]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[William S. Burroughs]] and many others, as well as bringing the work of survivors from earlier generations such as [[Raoul Hausmann]] and [[Marcel Janco]] to a fresh audience.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1986 Henri Chopin lived in [[Ingatestone, Essex]], but with the death of his wife Jean in 1985, he moved back to France.\n\nIn 2001 with his health failing, he returned to England, living with his daughter and family at [[Dereham, Norfolk]] {{harv|Acquaviva|2008}}.\n\n==Aesthetics==\nChopin's ''poesie sonore'' aesthetics included a deliberate cultivation of a ''barbarian'' approach in production, using raw or crude sound manipulations to explore the area between\ndistortion and intelligibility. He avoided high-quality, professional recording machines, preferring to use very basic equipment and ''bricolage'' methods, such as sticking matchsticks in the erase heads of a second-hand tape recorder, or manually interfering with the tape path {{harv|Wendt|1985|loc=16\u201317}}.\n\n== Books ==\n*Chopin, Henri. 1979.

It is a [[synthetic element]] and [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>270</sup>Hs, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 10&nbsp;seconds. More than 100&nbsp;atoms of hassium have been synthesized to date.<ref name=\"emsley\"/>\n\nIn the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. Hassium is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 8 elements]]: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[osmium]] in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements.

In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities.

This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high, narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life-times to spontaneous fission.<ref name=Focus/><ref name=Dvorak/> The spontaneous fission half-lives in this region are typically reduced by a factor of 10<sup>9</sup> in comparison with those in the vicinity of the spherical doubly magic nucleus <sup>298</sup>[[flerovium|Fl]], caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei.<ref name=Smolanczuk/> Hence, the nucleus <sup>270</sup>Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus. Experimental data from the decay of the [[darmstadtium]] (Z=110) isotopes <sup>271</sup>Ds and <sup>273</sup>Ds provides strong evidence for the magic nature of the [[neutron number|N]]=162 [[nuclear shell|sub-shell]].

This compound is analogous to the lighter [[ferrocene]], [[ruthenocene]], and [[osmocene]], and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an [[eclipsed conformation]] like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a [[staggered conformation]] like ferrocene.<ref name=\"hassocene\"/> Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in [[metallocene]]s) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state.<ref name=\"hassocene\"/> Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier.

As a part of this strategy, he negotiated the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (culminating in the [[SALT I treaty]]) and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest upon the [[Prague Spring|invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|left|Kissinger, shown here with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]], negotiated rapprochement with the People's Republic of China.]]\nKissinger sought to place diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union.

His trips paved the way for the groundbreaking [[Nixon visit to China 1972|1972 summit]] between Nixon, Zhou, and [[Communist Party of China]] Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the [[Sino-American relations|formalization of relations]] between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility. The result was the formation of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.\n\nWhile Kissinger's diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of Liaison Offices in the Chinese and American capitals, with serious implications for Indochinese matters, full normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China would not occur until 1979, because the [[Watergate scandal]] overshadowed the latter years of the Nixon presidency and because the United States continued to recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan.\n\nIn September 1989, the Wall Street Journal's John Fialka disclosed that Kissinger took a direct economic interest in US-China relations in March 1989 with the establishment of China Ventures, Inc., a Delaware limited partnership, of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  A US$75 million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, China International Trust & Investment Corporation (CITIC), was its purpose.  Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates.  Kissinger was criticised for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's [[Peter Jennings]] to comment the morning after the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen crackdown.  Kissinger's position was generally supportive of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s clearance of the square and he opposed economic sanctions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soley |first=Lawrence C. |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |title=The News Shapers: The Sources who Explain the News |year=1992 |page=?}}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam War===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}{{See also|Cambodian Civil War|Laotian Civil War}}\n[[File:Meeting at Camp David to discuss the Vietnam situation - NARA - 194466.tif|thumb|right|Kissinger with President [[Richard Nixon]], discussing Vietnam situation in [[Camp David]], 1972.]]\nKissinger's involvement in [[Indochina]] started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. While still at Harvard, he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the [[White House]] and State Department. Kissinger says that \"In August 1965&nbsp;... <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, an old friend serving as [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam|Ambassador to Saigon]], had asked me to visit Vietnam as his consultant.

In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN). Kissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The bombing campaign contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\", in Susan E.

[[Cnidaria]] and class [[Hydrozoa]]. They are native to the temperate and tropical regions.<ref>Gilberson, Lance (1999) ''Zoology Lab Manual'', 4th edition. Primis Custom Publishing.</ref><ref>Solomon, E., Berg, l., Martin, D. (2002) ''Biology'' 6th edition. Brooks/Cole Publishing.</ref> Biologists are especially interested in ''Hydra'' because of their [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative ability]] \u2014 they do not appear to die of old age, or indeed to [[senescence|age]] at all.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n[[File:Hydra nematocyst firing 01.png|thumb|left|Schematic drawing of a discharging nematocyst]]\n\n''Hydra'' has a tubular, [[symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetric]] body up to {{convert|10|mm|abbr=on}} long when extended, secured by a simple adhesive foot called the basal disc. Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties.\n\nAt the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to twelve thin, mobile [[tentacle]]s. Each tentacle, or cnida (plural: cnidae), is clothed with highly specialised stinging cells called [[cnidocyte]]s. Cnidocytes contain specialized structures called [[nematocyst]]s, which look like miniature light bulbs with a coiled thread inside. At the narrow outer edge of the cnidocyte is a short trigger hair called a cnidocil. Upon contact with prey, the contents of the nematocyst are explosively discharged, firing a dart-like thread containing [[neurotoxin]]s into whatever triggered the release which can paralyse the prey, especially if many hundreds of nematocysts are fired.\n\n''Hydra'' has two main body layers, which makes it \"[[diploblastic]]\". The layers are separated by [[mesoglea]], a gel-like substance. The outer layer is the [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], and the inner layer is called the [[gastrodermis]], because it lines the stomach. The cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple. [[Hydramacin]]<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Dingley|first2=A.

G.|last13=Grotzinger|first13=J.|display-authors=etal}}</ref> is a bactericide recently discovered in ''Hydra''; it protects the outer layer against infection.\n\nThe nervous system of ''Hydra'' is a [[nerve net]], which is structurally simple compared to [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|more derived]] animal nervous systems. ''Hydra'' does not have a recognizable [[brain]] or true [[muscle]]s. Nerve nets connect sensory [[Eyespot apparatus|photoreceptor]]s and touch-sensitive nerve cells located in the body wall and tentacles.\n\nRespiration and excretion occur by [[diffusion]] everywhere through the epidermis.\n\n==Motion and locomotion==\n[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|''Hydra'' attached to a substrate]]\nIf ''Hydra'' are alarmed or attacked, the tentacles can be retracted to small buds, and the body column itself can be retracted to a small gelatinous sphere. ''Hydra'' generally react in the same way regardless of the direction of the stimulus, and this may be due to the simplicity of the nerve nets.\n\n''Hydra'' are generally [[Wiktionary:sedentary|sedentary]] or [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], but do occasionally move quite readily, especially when hunting. They have two distinct methods for moving \u2013 'looping' and 'somersaulting'. They do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] with the mouth and tentacles and then relocate the foot, which provides the usual attachment, this process is called looping. In somersaulting, the body then bends over and makes a new place of attachment with the foot. By this process of \"looping\" or \"somersaulting\", a ''Hydra'' can move several inches (c.&nbsp;100&nbsp;mm) in a day. ''Hydra'' may also move by [[Amoeboid movement|amoeboid motion]] of their bases or by detaching from the substrate and floating away in the current.\n\n==Reproduction and life cycle== \n[[File:Hydra Budding.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|''Hydra'' ''[[budding]]'':<br>1. Non-reproducing<br>2. Creating a bud<br>3. Daughter growing out<br>4. Beginning to cleave<br>5. Daughter broken off<br>6. Daughter [[Clone (cell biology)|clone]] of parent]]\nWhen food is plentiful, many ''Hydra'' reproduce asexually by producing buds in the body wall, which grow to be miniature adults and break away when they are mature.\n\nWhen a hydra is well fed, a new bud can form every two days.<ref>Patton, Wendell K. \"Hydra (coelenterate).\" Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia. Grolier Online, 2014. Web. 12 Aug. 2014.</ref> When conditions are harsh, often before winter or in poor feeding conditions, [[sexual reproduction]] occurs in some ''Hydra''. Swellings in the body wall develop into either ovaries or testes. The testes release free-swimming gametes into the water, and these can fertilize the egg in the ovary of another individual. The fertilized eggs secrete a tough outer coating, and, as the adult dies (due to starvation and/or cold), these resting eggs fall to the bottom of the lake or pond to await better conditions, whereupon they hatch into nymph ''Hydra''. Some ''Hydra'' species, like ''[[H. circumcincta]]'' and ''[[H. viridissima]]'', are [[hermaphrodite]]s<ref>Holstein, T. (1995) ''Cnidaria: Hydrozoa S\u00fcsswasserfauna von Mitteleuropa. 1/2+ 3.''

Despite their simple construction, the tentacles of ''Hydra'' are extraordinarily extensible and can be four to five times the length of the body. Once fully extended, the tentacles are slowly manoeuvred around waiting for contact with a suitable prey animal. Upon contact, nematocysts on the tentacle fire into the prey, and the tentacle itself coils around the prey. Within 30 seconds, most of the remaining tentacles will have already joined in the attack to subdue the struggling prey. Within two minutes, the tentacles will have surrounded the prey and moved it into the opened mouth aperture. Within ten minutes, the prey will have been engulfed within the body cavity, and digestion will have started. ''Hydra'' are able to stretch their body wall considerably in order to digest prey more than twice their size. After two or three days, the indigestible remains of the prey will be discharged through the mouth aperture via contractions.\n\nThe feeding behaviour of ''Hydra'' demonstrates the sophistication of what appears to be a simple nervous system.\n\nSome species of ''Hydra'' exist in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutual relationship]] with various types of unicellular [[algae]]. The algae are protected from predators by ''Hydra'' and, in return, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products from the algae are beneficial as a food source to ''Hydra''.\n\n==Measuring the feeding response==\n\n[[File:Fig1 TentacleSpread wiki.png|thumb|Addition of glutathione causes reduction in the tentacle spread in hydra.]]\nThe feeding response in ''Hydra'' is induced by reduced [[glutathione]] released from injured prey.<ref>Loomis, W.F.  Glutathione control of the specific feeding reactions of hydra. Ann. Ny. Acad. Sci. 62, 209\u2013228</ref> There are several methods conventionally used for quantification of the feeding response. In some, the duration for which the mouth remains open is measured.<ref>Bellis, S.L., Laux, D.C., & Rhoads, D.E. Affinity purification of Hydra glutathione binding proteins. FEBS Lett. 354, 320\u2013324</ref> Other methods rely on counting the number of ''Hydra'' among a small population showing the feeding response after addition of glutathione.<ref>Venturini, G.

This method has been validated using a starvation model, as starvation is known to cause enhancement of the ''Hydra'' feeding response.<ref name=\"kulk\" />\n\n==Morphallaxis==\n\n''Hydra'' undergoes [[morphallaxis]] (tissue regeneration) when injured or severed.\n\n==Non-senescence==\nDaniel Martinez claimed in a 1998 article in ''Experimental Gerontology'' that ''Hydra'' are [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=May 1998|title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in ''Hydra''|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=2676ABC0E609BE470C7B3FF1680E15D2?doi=10.1.1.500.9508&rep=rep1&type=pdf|journal=Experimental Gerontology|volume=33|issue=3|pages=217\u2013225|doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7|pmid=9615920|author=Martinez, D.

It was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s [[Uranometria]] of 1603. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille|Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted the brighter [[star]]s and gave their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. Its name means \"male water snake\", as opposed to [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most [[Northern Hemisphere]] observers.\n\nThe brightest star is the 2.8-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] [[Beta Hydri]], also the closest reasonably bright star to the [[pole star#Southern pole star (South Star)|south celestial pole]]. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, [[Gamma Hydri]] is a variable [[red giant]] 60 times the diameter of our [[Sun]]. Lying near it is [[VW Hydri]], one of the brightest [[dwarf nova]]e in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have [[exoplanet]]s to date, including [[HD 10180]], which could bear up to nine planetary companions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Johann Bayer - Uraniometria - Southern Birds.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Hydrus (lower right) in an extract from [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'', its first appearance in a celestial atlas.]]\nHydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]].

Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''<!--is this right?--> derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]].

One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]\", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K.

In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states:\n\n{{bquote|... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''<ref>or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants.

''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''.  D.S. Brewer. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[K\u00f6ln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\n\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe.

Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\n<blockquote>\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==In art==\nIn Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.<ref>''Hercules'' almost suggests \"Hero\". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu], jpg file.

Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] (d. 992) is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his [[baptism]] in 966. Mieszko's duchy of Poland was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. Perhaps the most successful of the Piast kings was the last one, [[Casimir III the Great]], who presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569. \n\nIn its early phases, the Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced during the later part of the 18th century, especially in the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reform process to advance. The independent existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\nFrom 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. After the failure of the last military uprising against the Russian Empire, the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, the nation preserved its identity through educational initiatives and a program of \"[[organic work]]\" intended to modernize the economy and society. The opportunity to regain independence only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]], established in 1918, existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] destroyed it in their [[invasion of Poland]] at the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 as Germany classified ethnic [[Poles]] and other [[Slavs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsies) as [[Untermensch|subhuman]]. Nazi authorities targeted the last two groups for [[the Holocaust|extermination in the short term]], deferring the extermination and/or enslavement of the Slavs as part of the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' ('General Plan for the East') conceived by the Nazi r\u00e9gime. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[communism|communist]] [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the victorious Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]].

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government.

New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education.

Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left|275px]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>.\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|155px|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915.

According to the language criterion of the [[Polish census of 1931]], the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the [[Yiddish]] language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 millions in 1919 to 34.8 millions in 1939),<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 18%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=360}}.</ref>\n\nConditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to [[Norman Davies]], the failures of the Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more repressive regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\n===Final Sanation years (1935\u20131939)===\n\n[[File:Sk\u0142adkowski premierem.jpg|thumb|left|285px|A year after Pi\u0142sudski's death, his former personal assistant General [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] became the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s last prime minister]]\n\nAfter Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, Poland was governed until (and initially during) the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of 1939]] by old allies and subordinates known as \"[[Pi\u0142sudski's colonels]]\".

OUN engaged in political assassinations, terror and sabotage, to which the Polish state responded with a repressive campaign in the 1930s, as [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors imposed [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia|collective responsibility on the villagers]] in the affected areas. After the disturbances of 1933 and 1934, the [[Bereza Kartuska prison]] camp was established; it became notorious for its brutal regime. The government brought Polish settlers and administrators to parts of [[Volhynia]] with a centuries-old tradition of Ukrainian peasant rising against Polish land owners (and to Eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]). In the late 1930s, after Pi\u0142sudski's death, military persecution intensified and a policy of \"national assimilation\" was aggressively pursued. Military raids, public beatings, property confiscations and the closing and destruction of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches aroused lasting enmity in Galicia and antagonized Ukrainian society in Volhynia at the worst possible moment, according to [[Timothy D. Snyder]]. However, he also notes that \"Ukrainian terrorism and Polish reprisals touched only part of the population, leaving vast regions unaffected\" and \"the OUN's nationalist prescription, a Ukrainian state for ethnic Ukrainians alone was far from popular\".

The inability of Polish kings to levy and collect taxes (and therefore sustain a standing army) and conduct independent foreign policy were among the chief obstacles to Poland competing effectively on the changed European scene, where absolutist power was a prerequisite for survival and became the foundation for the abolition of [[serfdom]] and gradual formation of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarism]].<ref name=\"Polska urojona\"/>\n\n''t.''{{Note label|t|t|none}}Besides the [[Home Army]] there were other major underground fighting formations: [[Bataliony Ch\u0142opskie]], [[National Armed Forces]] (NSZ) and [[Gwardia Ludowa]] (later [[Armia Ludowa]]).<ref name=\"playground 344-346\"/> From 1943, the leaders of the nationalistic NSZ collaborated with Nazi Germany in a case unique in occupied Poland.

Capacity is specified in [[unit prefix]]es corresponding to powers of {{Not a typo|1000}}: a 1-[[terabyte]] (TB) drive has a capacity of {{Not a typo|1,000}} [[gigabyte]]s (GB; where 1 gigabyte = {{Not a typo|1 billion}} [[byte]]s). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the [[file system]] and the computer [[operating system]], and possibly inbuilt redundancy for [[error correction]] and recovery. Performance is specified by the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time) plus the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average [[Latency (engineering)|latency]], which is a function of the physical [[rotational speed]] in [[revolutions per minute]]), and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).\n\nThe two most common [[Form factor (design)|form factors]] for modern HDDs are 3.5-[[inch]], for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by standard [[computer interface|interface]] cables such as [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] (Parallel ATA), [[SATA]] (Serial ATA), [[USB]] or SAS ([[Serial Attached SCSI]]) cables.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of hard disk drives}}\n[[File:HardDisk1.ogg|thumb|Video of modern HDD operation (cover removed)]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"max-width: 35em;\"\n|+ Improvement of HDD characteristics over time\n|-\n!

[[Cylinder-head-sector|Cylinder-mode]] read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6&nbsp;\u00b5m) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.\n\nAlso, in 1962, IBM introduced the [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk drive, which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable [[disk pack]]. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of [[magnetic tape]]. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called \"fixed disk\" drives.\n\nSome high-performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track (e.g. [[IBM&nbsp;2305]] in 1970) so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track.<ref>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Guide 1995, Chapter 17 \u2013 Disk and File System Basics</ref> Known as fixed-head or head-per-track disk drives they were very expensive and are no longer in production.<ref name=\"CHAUDHURI2008\">{{cite book |last=P.

Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to \"land\" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, \"taking off\" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of \"Winchester technology\" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later \"Winchester\" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.\n\nLike the first removable pack drive, the first \"Winchester\" drives used platters {{convert|14|in}} in diameter. A few years later, designers were exploring the possibility that physically smaller platters might offer advantages. Drives with non-removable eight-inch platters appeared, and then drives that used a {{convert|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} [[#Form factors|form factor]] (a mounting width equivalent to that used by contemporary [[floppy disk drive]]s). The latter were primarily intended for the then-fledgling personal computer (PC) market.\n\nAs the 1980s began, HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs, but by the late 1980s their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers.\n\nMost HDDs in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users as an external, add-on subsystem. The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer's name but under the subsystem manufacturer's name such as [[Corvus Systems]] and [[Tallgrass Technologies]], or under the PC system manufacturer's name such as the [[Apple ProFile]]. The [[IBM PC/XT]] in 1983 included an internal 10&nbsp;MB HDD, and soon thereafter internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers.\n\nExternal HDDs remained popular for much longer on the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a [[SCSI]] port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]], and [[Macintosh Plus]] did not feature a hard drive bay at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.\n\nThe [[2011&nbsp;Thailand floods]] damaged the manufacturing plants and impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between 2011 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blog.backblaze.com/2012/10/09/backblaze_drive_farming/\n | title = Farming hard drives: how Backblaze weathered the Thailand drive crisis\n | year = 2013 | accessdate = May 23, 2014\n | website = blaze.com\n}}</ref>\n\nDriven by ever increasing [[memory storage density|areal density]], HDDs have continuously improved; a few highlights are listed in the table above. Market applications expanded through the 2000s, from the [[mainframe computer]]s of the late 1950s to most [[mass storage]] applications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content. \n\nNAND performance is improving faster than HDDs, and applications for HDDs are eroding. Smaller form factors, 1.8-inches and below, were discontinued around 2010. The price of solid-state storage (NAND), represented by [[Moore's law]], is improving faster than HDDs. NAND has a higher [[price elasticity of demand]] than HDDs, and this drives market growth.<ref name= Appleton >{{Cite web |url=\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/flash-goes-the-notebook/ |title=Flash goes the notebook |last= Kanellos |first= Michael |date= January 17, 2006 |publisher= CNET |access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref> During the late 2000s and 2010s, the [[Marketing#Product_life_cycle | product life cycle]] of HDDs entered a mature phase, and slowing sales may indicate the onset of the declining phase.<ref name= lifecycle >{{Cite web |url= https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/industry-life-cycle.html |title=Industry Life Cycle - Encyclopedia - Business Terms {{!}} Inc.com |publisher= Inc Magazine |access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:magneticMedia.svg|thumb|Magnetic cross section & [[frequency modulation]] encoded binary data]]\n\n=== Magnetic recording ===\n{{See also|Magnetic storage}}\n\nA modern HDD records data by magnetizing a thin film of [[ferromagnetic material]]{{Efn|Initially gamma iron oxide particles in an epoxy binder, the recording layer in a modern HDD typically is domains of a granular Cobalt-Chrome-Platinum-based alloy physically isolated by an oxide to enable [[perpendicular recording]].<ref>[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.5543.pdf New Paradigms in Magnetic Recording]</ref>}} on a disk. Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent binary data [[bit]]s. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization.

The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy, glass, or ceramic.

The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material passing immediately under it.\n\nIn modern drives, there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a [[voice coil]] actuator or in some older designs a [[stepper motor]]. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having the same amount of data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use [[zone bit recording]] \u2013 increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.\n\nIn modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of [[superparamagnetism|thermal effects]], thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the \"[[superparamagnetic limit]]\". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a three-atom layer of the non-magnetic element [[ruthenium]], and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.<ref name=\"AutoMK-15\" /> Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is [[perpendicular recording]], first shipped in 2005,<ref name=\"AutoMK-16\" /> and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.<ref name=\"AutoMK-17\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-18\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-19\" />\n\nIn 2004, a new concept was introduced to allow further increase of the data density in magnetic recording, using recording media consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. That so-called ''[[exchange spring media]]'', also known as ''exchange coupled composite media'', allows good writability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. However, the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer.<ref name=AutoMK-19a /><ref name=AutoMK-19b />\n\n=== Components ===\n[[File:Hard disk dismantled.jpg|thumb|left|HDD with disks and motor hub removed exposing copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing in the center of the spindle motor. Orange stripe along the side of the arm is thin printed-circuit cable, spindle bearing is in the center and the actuator is in the upper left]]\n\nA typical HDD has two electric motors; a spindle motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to [[amplifier]] electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 [[g-force|''g'']].\n\n[[File:Kopftraeger WD2500JS-00MHB0.jpg|thumb|Head stack with an actuator coil on the left and read/write heads on the right]]\n[[File:HDD read-write head.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a single [[Disk read-and-write head|read-write head]], showing the side facing the platter]]\n\nThe ''{{visible anchor|actuator|Actuator}}'' is a [[permanent magnet]] and [[moving coil]] motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat [[neodymium magnet|neodymium-iron-boron]] (NIB) high-flux [[magnet]]. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the ''[[voice coil]]'' by analogy to the coil in [[loudspeaker]]s, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives have only one magnet).\n\nThe voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, and made of doubly coated copper [[magnet wire]]. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) then interact with the [[magnetic field]] of the fixed magnet. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the [[magnetic field#Force on a charged particle|tangential force]]. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.\n\nThe HDD's electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the [[disk controller]]. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to [[Servomotor|servo]] feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.\n\n=== {{anchor|ERRORRATESHANDLING}}Error rates and handling ===\nModern drives make extensive use of [[forward error correction|error correction codes]] (ECCs), particularly [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]]. These techniques store extra bits, determined by mathematical formulas, for each block of data; the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly. The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity.<ref name=\"AutoMK-20\" /> For example, a typical 1&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GB]] for the [[Forward error correction|ECC]] data.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.idema.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/12/AF-in-Legacy-Infrastructures-SDC2011_IDEMA-AF.pdf\n | title = Advanced Format in Legacy Infrastructures: More Transparent than Disruptive\n | format = PDF | year = 2011 | accessdate = November 5, 2013\n | author = Curtis E.

Also the difference in capacity reported in SI decimal prefixed units vs. [[binary prefixes]] can lead to a false impression of missing capacity.\n\n=== Calculation ===\nModern hard disk drives appear to their host controller as a contiguous set of logical blocks, and the gross drive capacity is calculated by multiplying the number of blocks by the block size. This information is available from the manufacturer's product specification, and from the drive itself through use of operating system functions that invoke low-level drive commands.<ref name=\"SAS\" /><ref name=\"SATA\" />\n\nThe gross capacity of older HDDs is calculated as the product of the number of [[cylinder (disk drive)|cylinders]] per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of [[Zone bit recording|zones]] of the drive.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Some modern SATA drives also report [[cylinder-head-sector]] (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by [[logical block addressing]] (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.idema.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1223\n | title = LBA Count for Disk Drives Standard (Document LBA1-03)\n | date = June 15, 2009 | accessdate = February 14, 2016\n | publisher = [[IDEMA]] | format = PDF\n}}</ref> When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}, has between one and four platters.\n\nIn modern HDDs, spare capacity for defect management is not included in the published capacity; however, in many early HDDs a certain number of sectors were reserved as spares, thereby reducing the capacity available to the operating system.\n\nFor [[RAID]] subsystems, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID&nbsp;1 array has about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring, while a RAID&nbsp;5 array with {{mvar|x}} drives loses {{mvar|1/x}} of capacity (which equals to the capacity of a single drive) due to storing parity information. RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provide fault tolerance. Most RAID vendors use [[checksum]]s to improve data integrity at the block level. Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes, or by using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.<ref name=\"AutoMK-38\" />\n\nSome systems may use hidden [[disk partitioning|partitions]] for system recovery, reducing the capacity available to the end user.\n\n=== Formatting ===\n{{Main article|Disk formatting}}\nData is stored on a hard drive in a series of logical blocks.  Each block is delimited by markers identifying its start and end, error detecting and correcting information, and space between blocks to allow for minor timing variations.  These blocks often contained 512 bytes of usable data, but other sizes have been used.  As drive density increased, an initiative known as [[Advanced Format]] extended the block size to 4096 bytes of usable data, with a resulting significant reduction in the amount of disk space used for block headers, error checking data, and spacing.\n\nThe process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called ''low-level formatting'', which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html|title=Low-Level Formatting|publisher=|access-date=June 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604064402/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html|archive-date=June 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''High-level formatting'' writes data structures used by the operating system to organize data files on the disk.

For example, some of the disk space will be used to hold a directory of disk file names and a list of logical blocks associated with a particular file.\n\nExamples of partition mapping scheme include [[Master boot record]] (MBR) and [[GUID Partition Table]] (GPT). Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) in the [[DOS]] file system and [[inode]]s in many [[UNIX]] file systems, as well as other operating system data structures (also known as [[metadata]]). As a consequence, not all the space on an HDD is available for user files, but this system overhead is usually small compared with user data.\n\n=== Units ===\n{{See also|Binary prefix#Disk drives|l1=Binary prefix \u00a7 disk drives}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ Decimal and binary [[unit prefix]]es interpretation<ref name=\"SeagateStorageGuide\" /><ref name=\"WD2\" />\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity advertised by manufacturers{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"|Expressed using [[SI prefix#List of SI prefixes|decimal&nbsp;multiples]].}}\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity expected by some consumers{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"|Expressed using [[binary prefix|binary&nbsp;multiples]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Reported capacity\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | [[Windows]]{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"}}\n! rowspan=2 | [[macOS]] ver 10.6+{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"}}\n|-\n!

The [[Microsoft Windows]] family of operating systems uses the binary convention when reporting storage capacity, so an HDD offered by its manufacturer as a 1&nbsp;TB drive is reported by these operating systems as a 931&nbsp;GB HDD. [[macOS|Mac OS X]] 10.6 (\"[[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]\") uses decimal convention when reporting HDD capacity.<ref name=\"Apple\" /> The default behavior of the {{Mono|df}} [[command-line utility]] on Linux is to report the HDD capacity as a number of 1024-byte units.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://linux.die.net/man/1/df\n | title = df(1) \u2013 Linux man page\n | accessdate = July 18, 2015\n | website = linux.die.net\n}}</ref>\n\nThe difference between the decimal and binary prefix interpretation caused some consumer confusion and led to class action suits [[Binary prefix#Legal disputes|against HDD manufacturers]].

In 1962, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk, which used six 14-inch (nominal size) platters in a removable pack and was roughly the size of a washing machine. This became a standard platter size and drive form-factor for many years, used also by other manufacturers.<ref name=\"AutoMK-39\" /> The [[IBM 2314]] used platters of the same size in an eleven-high pack and introduced the \"drive in a drawer\" layout, although the \"drawer\" was not the complete drive.\n\nLater drives were designed to fit entirely into a chassis that would mount in a [[19-inch rack]]. Digital's [[RK05]] and RL01 were early examples using single 14-inch platters in removable packs, the entire drive fitting in a 10.5-inch-high rack space (six rack units). In the mid-to-late 1980s the similarly sized [[Fujitsu Eagle]], which used (coincidentally) 10.5-inch platters, was a popular product.\n\nSuch large platters were never used with microprocessor-based systems. With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in [[floppy disk|floppy-disk drives (FDDs)]], HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD ''Form factors'', initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Although referred to by these nominal sizes, the actual sizes for those three drives respectively are 9.5\u2033, 5.75\u2033 and 4\u2033 wide.  Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.  2.5-inch drives are actually 2.75\u2033 wide.\n\n{{As of|2012}}, 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard disks were the most popular sizes.  By 2009, all manufacturers had discontinued the development of new products for the 1.3-inch, 1-inch and 0.85-inch form factors due to falling prices of [[flash memory]],<ref name=\"AutoMK-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-52\" /> which has no moving parts. While nominal sizes are in inches, actual dimensions are specified in millimeters.\n\n== Performance characteristics ==\n{{Main article|Hard disk drive performance characteristics}}\nThe factors that limit the [[access time|time to access the data]] on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads.\n\n[[Seek time]] is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. The first HDD had an average seek time of about 600&nbsp;ms.<ref name=\"IBM350\" />  Some early PC drives used a [[stepper motor]] to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80\u2013120&nbsp;ms, but this was quickly improved by [[voice coil]] type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20&nbsp;ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time.  The fastest server drives today have a seek time around 4 ms.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/3636/western-digitals-new-velociraptor-vr200m-10k-rpm-at-450gb-and-600gb\n | title = Western Digital's New VelociRaptor VR200M: 10K&nbsp;RPM at 450GB and 600GB\n | date = April 6, 2010 | accessdate = December 19, 2013\n | author = Anand Lal Shimpi | website = anandtech.com\n}}</ref> The average [[seek time]] is strictly the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.<ref name=\"AutoMK-66\" />\n\nRotational latency is incurred because the desired [[disk sector]] may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested. Average rotational latency is shown in the table, based on the statistical relation that the average latency is one-half the rotational period.\n\nThe [[bit rate]] or data transfer rate (once the head is in the right position) creates delay which is a function of the number of blocks transferred; typically relatively small, but can be quite long with the transfer of large contiguous files.\n\nDelay may also occur if the drive disks are stopped to save energy.\n\n[[Defragmentation]] is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" /> Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically. Although automatic defragmentation is intended to reduce access delays, performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress.<ref name=\"AutoMK-67\" />\n\nTime to access data can be improved by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) or by reducing the time spent seeking. Increasing areal density increases [[throughput]] by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. The time to access data has not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.\n\n=== Latency ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|-\n!

A current widely used standard for the \"buffer-to-computer\" interface is 3.0&nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by [[file system fragmentation]] and the layout of the files.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" />\n\nHDD data transfer rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk and the number of sectors per track,<ref>{{cite web |title=GLOSSARY of DRIVE and COMPUTER TERMS |url=ftp://ftp.seagate.com/techsuppt/misc/glossary.txt |publisher=Seagate |accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref> only the latter increases the data transfer rate for a given rpm. Since data transfer rate performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Other considerations ===\nOther performance considerations include quality-adjusted [[price index|price]], power consumption, audible noise, and both operating and non-operating shock resistance.\n\nThe [[Federal Reserve Board]] has a quality-adjusted [[price index]] for large-scale enterprise storage systems including three or more enterprise HDDs and associated controllers, racks and cables. Prices for these large-scale storage systems improved at the rate of \u201230% per year during 2004\u20132009 and \u201222% per year during 2009\u20132014.<ref name=\"Byrne2015b\"/>\n\n== Access and interfaces ==\n{{Main article|hard disk drive interface}}\n[[File:Seagate ST33232A hard disk inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a 1998 [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] HDD that used [[Parallel ATA]] interface]]\n[[File:2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors.jpg|thumb|right|2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors]]\n\nCurrent hard drives connect to a computer over one of several [[bus (computing)|bus]] types, including  parallel [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]], [[Serial ATA]] , [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), and [[Fibre Channel]]. Some drives, especially external portable drives, use [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE&nbsp;1394]], or  [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. All of these interfaces are digital; electronics on the drive process the analog signals from the read/write heads. Current drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, independent of the data encoding scheme used internally, and independent of the physical number of disks and heads within the drive. \n\nTypically a [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] in the electronics inside the drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses [[partial response maximum likelihood|PRML]] and [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]]<ref name=\"AutoMK-79\" /> to decode the data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by [[error detection and correction]], and performs [[bad sector]] remapping, data collection for [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology]], and other internal tasks.\n\nModern interfaces connect the drive to the host interface with a single data/control cable. Each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit. Older interfaces had separate cables for data signals and for drive control signals.\n* [[Small Computer System Interface]] (SCSI), originally named SASI for Shugart Associates System Interface, was standard on servers, workstations, [[Amiga peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] computers through the mid-1990s, by which time most models had been transitioned to IDE (and later, SATA) family disks. The length limit of the data cable allows for external SCSI devices.\n* [[Integrated Drive Electronics]] (IDE), later standardized under the name [[AT Attachment]] (ATA, with the alias PATA ([[Parallel ATA]]) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA) moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive. This helped to standardize the host/controller interface, reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver, and reduced system cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16&nbsp;bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements led to an   [[AT Attachment#Parallel ATA interface|\"ultra DMA\" (UDMA)]] mode using an 80-conductor cable with additional wires to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross talk]] at high speed.\n* EIDE was an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original IDE standard, with the key improvement being the use of [[direct memory access]] (DMA) to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the [[central processing unit|CPU]], an improvement later adopted by the official ATA standards. By directly transferring data between memory and disk, DMA eliminates the need for the CPU to copy byte per byte, therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs.\n* [[Fibre Channel]] (FC) is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the [[Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop]] (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it is the cornerstone of [[storage area network]]s (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like [[iSCSI]] and [[ATA over Ethernet]] have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use ''copper'' twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or [[disk array controller]]s.\n* [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands.\n* [[Serial ATA]] (SATA). The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like [[EIA-422]]. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar [[differential signaling]] system is used in [[RS485]], [[LocalTalk]], [[USB]], [[FireWire]], and differential [[SCSI]].\n\n== Integrity and failure ==\n[[File:Hard disk head.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an HDD head resting on a disk platter; its mirror reflection is visible on the platter surface.]]\n{{Main article|Hard disk drive failure|Data recovery}}\n{{also|Solid-state drive#SSD reliability and failure modes}}\n\nDue to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, HDDs are vulnerable to being damaged by a [[head crash]] \u2013 a [[hard disk failure|failure of the disk]] in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, [[corrosion]], or poorly manufactured platters and heads.\n\nThe HDD's spindle system relies on [[air density]] inside the [[disk enclosure]] to support the heads at their proper [[flying height]] while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5&nbsp;mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the ''breather filter'').<ref name=\"AutoMK-80\" /> If the air density is too low, then there is not enough lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AutoMK-81\" /> Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives \u2013 they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or \"recirc\") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.\n\nFor [[giant magnetoresistive effect|giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) heads in particular, a minor head crash from contamination (that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk) still results in the head temporarily overheating, due to friction with the disk surface, and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes (so called \"thermal asperity\", a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal).\n\nWhen the logic board of a hard disk fails, the drive can often be restored to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-to-tech/how-to-recover-data-hard-drive4.htm|title=How To Recover Lost Data from Your Hard Drive|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|publisher=HowStuffWorks|pages=5\u20136|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref> For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including [[fsck]] on [[UNIX-like]] systems and [[CHKDSK]] on [[Windows]], can be used for [[data recovery]].

Examples are: transaction processing databases, internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce), scientific computing software, and nearline storage management software. Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously (\"24/7\") in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.<ref name=\"AutoMK-99\" />\n: The fastest enterprise HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000&nbsp;rpm, and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6&nbsp;Gbit/s<ref name=\"erwpnw\" /> and a sustained transfer rate up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref name=\"erwpnw\" /> Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000&nbsp;rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as they have less [[air drag]]) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives.

It determines the dates for [[Jewish holiday]]s and the appropriate [[Torah reading|public reading]] of [[Weekly Torah portion|Torah portions]], ''[[yahrzeit]]s'' (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily [[Psalm]] readings, among many ceremonial uses. In [[Israel]], it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture and is an official calendar for civil purposes, although the latter usage has been steadily declining in favor of the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe present Hebrew calendar is the product of evolution, including a [[Babylonian calendar|Babylonian]] influence. Until the [[Tannaitic]] period (approximately 10\u2013220 CE), the calendar employed a new [[lunar phase|crescent moon]], with an additional month normally added every two or three years to correct for the difference between twelve lunar months and the solar year. The year in which it was added was based on observation of natural agriculture-related events in Israel.<ref>Specifically, the ripening of the [[barley]] crop; the age of the kids, lambs, and doves; the ripeness of the fruit trees; and the relation of the date to the {{lang|he-Latn|[[tekufah]]}} (seasons). See the Talmud, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11b</ref> Through the [[Amoraic]] period (200\u2013500 CE) and into the [[Geonic]] period, this system was gradually displaced by the mathematical rules used today. The principles and rules were fully codified by [[Maimonides]] in the {{lang|he-Latn|[[Mishneh Torah]]}} in the 12th century. Maimonides' work also replaced counting \"years since the destruction of the Temple\" with the modern creation-era {{lang|la|[[Anno Mundi]]}}.\n\nThe Hebrew lunar year is about eleven days shorter than the solar year and uses the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]] to bring it into line with the solar year, with the addition of an [[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month every two or three years, for a total of seven times per 19 years. Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean [[tropical year]], so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe era used since the [[Middle Ages]] is the {{lang|la|[[Anno Mundi]]}} [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] ([[Latin]] for \"in the year of the world\"; {{lang-he|\u05dc\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd}}, \"from the creation of the world\"). As with {{lang|la|[[Anno Domini]]}} (A.D. or AD), the words or abbreviation for {{lang|la|Anno Mundi}} (A.M. or AM) for the era should properly ''precede'' the date rather than follow it. \n\nAM {{#time:xjY}} began at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum}}-1 day}} and will end at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum|{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}+1}}}}-1 day}}.<ref>This and certain other calculations in this article are now provided by a template ({{tl|Hebrew year/rhdatum}}).

The time between true sunset and the time when the three stars are visible (known as 'tzait ha'kochavim') is known as 'bein hashmashot', and there are differences of opinion as to which day it falls into for some uses. This may be relevant, for example, in determining the date of birth of a child born during that gap.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/134527/jewish/Zmanim-Briefly-Defined-and-Explained.htm</ref>\n\nThere is no clock in the Jewish scheme, so that the local civil clock is used. Though the civil clock, including the one in use in Israel, incorporates local adoptions of various conventions such as [[time zone]]s, [[standard time]]s and [[daylight saving]], these have no place in the Jewish scheme. The civil clock is used only as a reference point \u2013 in expressions such as: \"Shabbat starts at ...\". The steady progression of sunset around the world and seasonal changes results in gradual civil time changes from one day to the next based on observable astronomical phenomena (the sunset) and not on man-made laws and conventions.\n\nIn Judaism, an hour is defined as 1/12 of the time from sunrise to sunset, so, during the winter, an hour can be much less than 60 minutes, and during the summer, it can be much more than 60 minutes. This proportional hour is known as a ''[[Relative hour (Jewish law)|sha'ah z'manit]]'' (lit. a timely hour). [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Day|A Jewish hour]] is divided into 1080 ''halakim'' (singular: ''[[helek]]'') or parts. A part is 3\u2153 seconds or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>18</sub> minute. The ultimate ancestor of the helek was a small Babylonian time period called a ''barleycorn'', itself equal to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>72</sub> of a Babylonian ''time degree'' (1\u00b0 of celestial rotation).<ref name=Neugebauer1>Otto Neugebauer, \"The astronomy of Maimonides and its sources\", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'' '''23''' (1949) 322\u2013363.</ref> These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes.\n\nInstead of the [[international date line]] convention, there are varying opinions as to where the day changes. One opinion uses the [[antimeridian]] of [[Jerusalem]]. (Jerusalem is 35\u00b013' east of the [[prime meridian]], so the antimeridian is at 144\u00b047' W, passing through eastern [[Alaska]].) Other opinions exist as well.<ref>See Willie Roth's essay [http://koltorah.org/ravj/The%20International%20Date%20Line%20and%20Halacha.htm The International Date Line and ''Halacha''].</ref><ref>\"Appendix II: Baal HaMaor's Interpretation of 20b and its Relevance to the Dateline\" in ''Talmud Bavli'', Schottenstein Edition, Tractate ''Rosh HaShanah'', Mesorah Publications Ltd. (\"ArtScroll\") 1999, where \"20b\" refers to the 20th page 2nd folio of the tractate.</ref> (See [[International date line in Judaism]].)\n\nThe weekdays start with Sunday (day 1, or ''[[Yom]] Rishon'') and proceed to Saturday (day 7), [[Shabbat]]. Since some calculations use division, a remainder of 0 signifies Saturday.\n\nWhile calculations of days, months and years are based on fixed hours equal to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> of a day, the beginning of each ''halachic'' day is based on the local time of [[sunset]]. The end of the Shabbat and other [[Jewish holiday]]s is based on nightfall (''Tzeth haKochabim'') which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three-second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7\u00b0 below the geometric (airless) horizon, somewhat later than civil twilight at 6\u00b0. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and [[sunrise]]. Most ''halachic'' times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into ''[[Relative hour (Jewish law)|Sha'oth Zemaniyoth]]'' or \"Halachic hours\" by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the \"hours\" of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for [[Jewish services]], the latest time to eat [[chametz]] on the day before [[Passover]] and many other rules are based on ''Sha'oth Zemaniyoth''. For convenience, the modern day using ''Sha'oth Zemaniyoth'' is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00&nbsp;pm, sunrise at 6:00&nbsp;am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, ''halachic'' noon may be after 1:00&nbsp;pm in some areas during [[daylight saving time]]. Within the [[Mishnah]], however, the numbering of the hours starts with the \"first\" hour after the start of the day.<ref>See, for example, Berachot chapter 1, Mishnah 2.</ref>\n\n===Weeks===\nShavua [\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2] is a weekly cycle of seven days, mirroring the [[creation week|seven-day period]] of the [[Book of Genesis]] in which the world is created. The names for the days of the week, like those in the creation account, are simply the [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|day number]] within the week, with [[Shabbat]] being the seventh day. Each day of the week runs from sunset to the following sunset and is figured locally.\n\n====Names of weekdays====\n[[File:Maurice Ascalon Shabbat Candle Sticks.jpg|right|thumb|A bronze Shabbat candlestick holder made in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]] in the 1940s.]]\nThe Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently with but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the [[Hebrew numerals|numerical value]] of the Hebrew letters, for example {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05f3}} (''Day 1'', or [[Yom]] Rishon ({{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df}})):\n\n#Yom Rishon \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df}} (abbreviated {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05f3}}), meaning \"first day\" [corresponds to Sunday] (starting at preceding sunset of Saturday)\n#Yom Sheni \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05f3}}) meaning \"second day\" [corresponds to Monday]\n#Yom Shlishi \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d2\u05f3}}) meaning \"third day\" [corresponds to Tuesday]\n#Yom Revi\u02bbi \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d3\u05f3}}) meaning \"fourth day\" [corresponds to Wednesday]\n#Yom Chamishi \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05f3}}) = \"fifth day\" [corresponds to Thursday]\n#Yom Shishi \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05e9\u05d9}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05f3}}) meaning \"sixth day\" [corresponds to Friday]\n#Yom Shabbat \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea}} (abbr. {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05f3}}), or more usually, simply Shabbat \u2013 {{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea}} meaning \"rest day\" [corresponds to Saturday]\nYom Shabbat ({{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea}}) is also known as Yom Shabbat Kodesh \u2013 {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9}} meaning \"holy rest day.\"\n\nThe names of the days of the week are modeled on the seven days mentioned in the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] story. For example, {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|HE}} \"... And there was evening and there was morning, one day\". ''One day'' ({{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b6\u05d7\u05b8\u05d3}}) in Genesis 1:5 is translated in [[Jewish Publication Society|JPS]] as ''first day'', and in some other contexts (including KJV) as ''day one''. In subsequent verses, the Hebrew refers to the days using ordinal numbers, e.g., 'second day', 'third day', and so forth, but with the sixth and seventh days the Hebrew includes the definite article (\"the\").<ref>See {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|1:13|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|1:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|1:23|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|1:31|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|2.2|HE}}.</ref>\n\nThe rest day, [[Shabbat]], has a special role in the Jewish weekly cycle as being a special and set apart day, where no work is done. There are many special rules that relate to Shabbat, discussed more fully in the Talmudic tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]].\n\nIn (Talmudic) Hebrew, the word ''Shabbat'' ({{hebrew|\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea}}) can also mean \"week\",<ref>For example, according to [http://milon.morfix.co.il/default.aspx?q=\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea Morfix \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, Morfix Dictionary], which is based upon Prof. Yaakov Choeka's [[Rav Milim]] dictionary. But the word meaning a non-Talmudic week is \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 ''(shavu\u02bba)'', according to the same \"\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1\".</ref> so that in ritual liturgy a phrase like \"Yom Revi\u02bbi b\u0259Shabbat\" means \"the fourth day in the week\".<ref>For example, when referring to the daily psalm recited in the morning prayer ([[Jewish services#Shacharit: morning prayers|Shacharit]]).</ref>\n\n====Days of week of holidays====\n{{Main|Days of week on Hebrew calendar}}\n\nThe period from 1 Adar (or Adar II, in leap years) to 29 Marcheshvan contains all of the festivals specified in the Bible \u2013 [[Purim]] (14 Adar), [[Pesach]] (15 Nisan), [[Shavuot]] (6 Sivan), [[Rosh Hashanah]] (1 Tishrei), [[Yom Kippur]] (10 Tishrei), [[Sukkot]] (15 Tishrei), and [[Shemini Atzeret]] (22 Tishrei).

(See [[#Rosh Hashanah postponement rules|Rosh Hashanah postponement rules]], below.) These rules are implemented by adding an extra day to Marcheshvan (making it 30 days long) or by removing one day from Kislev (making it 29 days long). Accordingly, a common Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 353, 354 or 355 days, while a leap Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 383, 384 or 385 days.\n\n===Months===\nThe Hebrew calendar is a [[lunisolar calendar]], meaning that months are based on [[lunar month]]s, but years are based on [[solar year]]s.<ref>In contrast, the [[Gregorian calendar]] is a pure [[solar calendar]], while the [[Islamic calendar]] is a pure [[lunar calendar]].</ref> The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. (These extra months are added seven times every nineteen years. See [[#Leap months|Leap months]], below.) The beginning of each Jewish lunar month is based on the appearance of the [[new moon]].<ref>Under the fixed, calculated calendar, this is only loosely true. Because the calculations are based on ''mean'' lunar months, not observed ones\u2013and because of the [[#Rosh Hashanah postponement rules|Rosh Hashanah postponement rules]]\u2014a given month may not begin on the same day as its astronomical conjunction.

Accordingly, the basic Hebrew calendar year is one of twelve lunar months alternating between 29 and 30 days:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Month Number* !! rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"Bottom\"| Hebrew month !! rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"Bottom\"| Length\n|-\n! <small>Ecclesiastical/<br />Biblical</small> !! valign=\"Bottom\" | Civil\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7 || [[Nisan]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 8 || [[Iyar]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9 || [[Sivan]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10 || [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 11 || [[Av (month)|Av]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 12 || [[Elul]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 || [[Tishrei]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30 \n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 8 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 || [[Marcheshvan]] (or [[Cheshvan]]) || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29/30\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3 || [[Kislev]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30/29\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4 || [[Tevet]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 11 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5 || [[Shevat]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 12 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6 || [[Adar]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 29\n|-\n!colspan=3| Total\n| 353, 354 or 355\n|-style=\"background:#FFF;\" \n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>* \u2013 For the distinction between numbering systems, see {{slink||New year}} below.</small>\n|}\n\nIn leap years (such as 5779) an additional month, Adar I (30 days) is added after Shevat, while the regular Adar is referred to as \"Adar II.\"\n\nThe insertion of the leap month mentioned above is based on the requirement that [[Passover]]\u2014the festival celebrating the Exodus from Egypt, which took place in the spring\u2014always occurs in the [northern hemisphere's] spring season. Since the adoption of a fixed calendar, intercalations in the Hebrew calendar have been assigned to fixed points in a 19-year cycle. Prior to this, the intercalation was determined empirically:\n\n<blockquote>The year may be intercalated on three grounds: 'aviv [i.e.the ripeness of barley], fruits of trees, and the equinox. On two of these grounds it should be intercalated, but not on one of them alone.<ref name=\"Tosefta 1919, p. 31\">Tosefta ''Sanhedrin'' 2.2, Herbert Danby, Trans., ''Tractate Sanhedrin Mishnah and Tosefta'', Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London and New York, 1919, p. 31.

The structure, which was also used by the Israelites, was based on lunar months with the intercalation of an additional month to bring the cycle closer to the solar cycle, although there is no evidence of a thirteenth month mentioned anywhere in the Hebrew Bible.<ref name=\"DeVaux\">''Ancient Israel: Its Life and Institutions'' (1961) by Roland De Vaux, John McHugh, Publisher: McGraw\u2013Hill, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-4278-7}}, p.179</ref>\n\n{{bibleverse||Num|10:10|HE}} stresses the importance in Israelite religious observance of the new month (Hebrew: {{hebrew|\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9}}, [[Rosh Chodesh]], \"beginning of the month\"): \"... in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings...\" Similarly in {{bibleverse||Num|28:11|HE}}. \"The beginning of the month\" meant the appearance of a [[new moon]], and in {{bibleverse||Exod|12:2|HE}}. \"This month is to you\".\n\nAccording to the ''[[Mishnah]]'' and [[Tosefta]], in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new months were determined by the sighting of a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required to testify to the [[Sanhedrin]] to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset.<ref>M. ''Rosh Hashanah'' 1.7</ref> The practice in the time of [[Gamaliel II]] (c. 100 CE) was for witnesses to select the appearance of the moon from a collection of drawings that depicted the crescent in a variety of orientations, only a few of which could be valid in any given month.<ref>M. ''Rosh Hashanah'' 2.6\u20138</ref> These observations were compared against calculations.<ref name=\"epstein\">b. Rosh Hashanah 20b: \"This is what Abba the father of R. Simlai meant: 'We calculate the new moon's birth. If it is born before midday, then certainly it will have been seen shortly before sunset. If it was not born before midday, certainly it will not have been seen shortly before sunset.' What is the practical value of this remark? R. Ashi said: Confuting the witnesses.\" I. Epstein, Ed., ''The Babylonian Talmud Seder Mo'ed,'' Soncino Press, London, 1938, p. 85.</ref>\n\nAt first the beginning of each Jewish month was signaled to the communities of Israel and beyond by fires lit on mountaintops, but after the [[Samaritan]]s began to light false fires, messengers were sent.<ref>M. ''Rosh Hashanah'' 2.2</ref> The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days ([[Succot]] and [[Passover]]) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the [[Jewish diaspora]] because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.<ref>b. ''Betzah'' 4b</ref>\n\nIn his work ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (1178), Maimonides included a chapter \"Sanctification of the New Moon\", in which he discusses the calendrical rules and their scriptural basis. He notes, <blockquote>\"By how much does the solar year exceed the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, whenever this excess accumulates to about 30 days, or a little more or less, one month is added and the particular year is made to consist of 13 months, and this is the so-called embolismic (intercalated) year. For the year could not consist of twelve months plus so-and-so many days, since it is said: throughout the months of the year ({{bibleverse||Num|28:14|HE}}), which implies that we should count the year by months and not by days.\"<ref name=\"tcjmwz\">[https://personal.stevens.edu/~msenator/hand0.pdf Sanctification of the New Moon.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621084628/http://personal.stevens.edu/~msenator/hand0.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} Translated from the Hebrew by Solomon Gandz; supplemented, introduced, and edited by Julian Obermann; with an astronomical commentary by Otto Neugebauer.

The former name for October was Tesrin.\n\n'''Babylonian exile'''\n\nThe Jewish people left Babylon and returned to live in Judea around 586 BCE. At this time they adopted the Babylonian names for the months. The Babylonian calendar descended directly from the Sumerian calendar.<ref>http://www.ehebrew.org/articles/hebrew-calendar.php</ref>\n\nBiblical references to the pre-exilic calendar include ten months identified by number rather than by name. In parts of the [[Noach (parsha)|Torah portion ''Noach'']] (\"Noah\") (specifically, {{bibleverse||Gen|7:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:3\u20134|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:13\u201314|HE}}) it is implied that the months are thirty days long.<ref>{{bibleverse||Gen|7:11|HE}} says \"... on the ''seventeenth day of the second month''\u2014on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth...\" and {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:3\u20134|HE}} says \"...At the end of the ''hundred and fifty days'' the water had gone down, (4) and on the ''seventeenth day of the seventh month'' the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat...\" There is an interval of 5 months and 150 days, making each month 30 days long.</ref> There is also an indication that there were twelve months in the annual cycle ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|4:7|HE}}, {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|27:1\u201315|HE}}). Prior to the Babylonian exile, the names of only four months are referred to in the [[Tanakh]]:\n*''[[Aviv]]'' \u2013 first month \u2013 literally \"spring\" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:2|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|13:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|23:15|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|34:18|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deut.|16:1|HE}});\n*''[[Iyar|Ziv]]'' \u2013 second month \u2013 literally \"light\" ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|6:37|HE}});\n*''[[Ethanim]]'' \u2013 seventh month \u2013 literally \"strong\" in plural, perhaps referring to strong rains ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:2|HE}}); and\n*''[[Marcheshvan|Bul]]'' \u2013 eighth month ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:38|HE}}).\n\nAll of these are believed to be [[Canaan]]ite names.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hachlili|first=Rachel|title=Ancient Synagogues \u2013 Archaeology and Art: New Discoveries and Current Research|date=2013|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004257733|page=342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRjhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA342}}</ref> These names are only mentioned in connection with the building of the [[First Temple]]. H\u00e5kan Ulfgard suggests that the use of what are rarely used Canaanite (or in the case of Ethanim perhaps Northwest-semitic) names indicates that \"the author is consciously utilizing an archaizing terminology, thus giving the impression of an ancient story...\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ulfgard|first=H\u00e5kan|title=The Story of Sukkot : the Setting, Shaping and Sequel of the Biblical Feast of Tabernacles|date=1998|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=3-16-147017-6|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxnXaYBj2wgC&pg=PA99}}</ref>\n\nIn a regular (''kesidran'') year, Marcheshvan has 29 days and Kislev has 30 days. However, because of the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules (see below) Kislev may lose a day to have 29 days, and the year is called a short (''chaser'') year, or Marcheshvan may acquire an additional day to have 30 days, and the year is called a full (''maleh'') year. The calendar rules have been designed to ensure that Rosh Hashanah does not fall on a Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This is to ensure that [[Yom Kippur]] does not directly precede or follow [[Shabbat]], which would create practical difficulties, and that [[Hoshana Rabbah]] is not on a Shabbat, in which case certain ceremonies would be lost for a year.\n\n{{JewishCalendar}}\n\n====Leap months====\nThe solar year is about eleven days longer than twelve lunar months. The Bible does not directly mention the addition of \"embolismic\" or [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary months]]. However, without the insertion of embolismic months, Jewish festivals would gradually shift outside of the [[season]]s required by the Torah. This has been ruled as implying a requirement for the insertion of embolismic months to reconcile the lunar cycles to the seasons, which are integral to solar yearly cycles.\n\nWhen the observational form of the calendar was in use, whether or not an embolismic month was announced after the \"last month\" ([[Adar]]) depended on 'aviv [i.e., the ripeness of barley], fruits of trees, and the equinox. On two of these grounds it should be intercalated, but not on one of them alone.<ref name=\"Tosefta 1919, p. 31\"/> It may be noted that in the Bible the name of the first month, ''[[Aviv]]'', literally means \"spring\". Thus, if Adar was over and spring had not yet arrived, an additional month was observed.\n\nTraditionally, for the [[Babylonian calendar|Babylonian]] and Hebrew [[lunisolar calendar]]s, the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) years of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This cycle forms the basis of the Christian ecclesiastical calendar and the Hebrew calendar and is used for the [[Computus|computation of the date of Easter]] each year\n\nDuring [[leap year]]s Adar I (or Adar [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]] \u2013 \"first Adar\") is added before the regular [[Adar]]. Adar I is actually considered to be the extra month, and has 30 days. Adar II (or Adar [[Bet (letter)|Bet]] \u2013 \"second Adar\") is the \"real\" Adar, and has the usual 29 days. For this reason, holidays such as [[Purim]] are observed in Adar II, not Adar I.\n\n==== Constellations ====\n{{main|Hebrew astronomy|Jewish views on astrology}}\n[[Chronology]] was a chief consideration in the study of astronomy among the Jews; sacred time was based upon the cycles of the Sun and the Moon. The Talmud identified the twelve constellations of the [[zodiac]] with the twelve months of the Hebrew calendar.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The correspondence of the constellations with their names in Hebrew and the months is as follows:\n\n# [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] \u2013 Taleh \u2013 [[Nisan]]\n# [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] \u2013 Shor \u2013 [[Iyar]]\n# [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] \u2013 Teomim \u2013 [[Sivan]]\n# [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] \u2013 Sartan \u2013 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]]\n# [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] \u2013 Arye \u2013 [[Av (month)|Av]]\n# [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] \u2013 Betulah \u2013 [[Elul]]\n# [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] \u2013 Moznayim \u2013 [[Tishrei]]\n# [[Scorpius|Scorpio]] \u2013 'Akrab \u2013 [[Marcheshvan]]\n# [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] \u2013 Keshet \u2013 [[Kislev]]\n# [[Capricornus|Capricorn]] \u2013 Gdi \u2013 [[Tevet]]\n# [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] \u2013 Dli \u2013 [[Shevat]]\n# [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] \u2013 Dagim \u2013 [[Adar]]\n\nSome scholars identified the 12 signs of the zodiac with the 12 sons of [[Jacob]]/[[twelve tribes of Israel]].<ref>(12 Signs, 12 Sons: Astrology in the Bible, David Womack, Harper & Row, San Francisco 1978, pg 43)</ref>\nIt should be noted that the 12 [[lunar months]] of the Hebrew calendar are the normal months from new moon to new moon: the year normally contains twelve months averaging 29.52 days each. The discrepancy compared to the mean [[synodic month]] of 29.53 days is due to Adar I in a leap year always having thirty days. This means that the calendar year normally contains 354 days.\n\n<div style=\"float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;\">{{Hebrew year}}</div>\n\n===Years===\nThe Hebrew calendar year conventionally begins on [[Rosh Hashanah]]. However, other dates serve as the beginning of the year for different religious purposes.\n\nThere are three qualities that distinguish one year from another: whether it is a leap year or a common year, on which of four permissible days of the week the year begins, and whether it is a deficient, regular, or complete year. Mathematically, there are 24 (2\u00d74\u00d73) possible [[combination]]s, but only 14 of them are valid. Each of these patterns is called a ''keviyah'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] \u05e7\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 for \"a setting\" or \"an established thing\"), and is encoded as a series of two or three Hebrew letters. See [[#Four gates|Four gates]].\n\n{{anchor|writing}}In Hebrew there are two common ways of writing the year number: with the thousands, called {{hebrew|\u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc}} (\"major era\"), and without the thousands, called {{hebrew|\u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05d8 \u05e7\u05d8\u05df}} (\"minor era\"). Thus, the current year is written as <span style=\"direction:rtl;\">'''{{#time:xhxjY}}'''</span> &lrm;({{#time:xjY}}) using the \"major era\" and <span style=\"direction:rtl;\">'''{{#invoke:string|sub|{{#time:xhxjY}}|3|-1}}'''</span> &lrm;({{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}mod1000}}) using the \"minor era\".\n\n====Anno Mundi====\n{{further|Anno Mundi}}\n[[File:Creation of Light Detail 2.png|left|thumb|The Jewish calendar's reference point is traditionally held to be about one year ''before'' the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] of the world.]]\nIn 1178 CE, [[Maimonides]] wrote in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Sanctification of the Moon'' (11.16), that he had chosen the epoch from which calculations of all dates should be as \"the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world\" (March 22, 1178).<ref>Solomon, Gandz (1947\u20131948). \"Date of the Composition of Maimonides' Code\".

Mosshammer}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} Today, the rules detailed in Maimonides' calendrical code are those generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.\n\nSince the codification by Maimonides in 1178, the Jewish calendar has used the [[Anno Mundi]] [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] ([[Latin]] for \"in the year of the world,\" abbreviated ''AM'' or ''A.M.'', Hebrew {{hebrew|\u05dc\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd}}), sometimes referred to as the \"Hebrew era\", to distinguish it from other systems based on some computation of creation, such as the [[Byzantine calendar]].\n\nThere is also reference in the Talmud to [[Dating Creation|years since the creation]] based on the calculation in the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' of Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] in about 160 CE.<ref>p.107, Kantor</ref> By his calculation, based on the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Adam]] was created in 3760 BCE, later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">See ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]''.</ref> An example is the c. 8th century [[Baraita of Samuel]].\n\nAccording to rabbinic reckoning, the beginning of \"year 1\" is ''not'' [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]], but about one year before Creation, with the new moon of its first month (Tishrei) to be called ''molad tohu'' (the mean new moon of chaos or nothing). The Jewish calendar's epoch (reference date), 1 Tishrei AM 1, is equivalent to Monday, 7 October 3761 BC/BCE in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], the equivalent tabular date (same daylight period) and is about one year ''before'' the traditional Jewish [[Dating Creation|date of Creation]] on 25 Elul AM 1, based upon the ''Seder Olam Rabbah''.<ref>A minority opinion places Creation on 25 Adar AM 1, six months earlier, or six months after the modern epoch.</ref> Thus, adding 3760 before [[Rosh Hashanah]] or 3761 after to a [[Julian calendar|Julian]] year number starting from 1 CE (AD 1) will yield the Hebrew year. For earlier years there may be a discrepancy [see: [[Missing years (Jewish calendar)]]].\n\nThe ''Seder Olam Rabbah'' also recognized the importance of the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] and [[Shmita|Sabbatical]] cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme.\n\nOccasionally, ''Anno Mundi'' is styled as ''Anno Hebraico (AH)'',<ref>{{Chicago 16th |at=9.34|title=Eras}}</ref> though this is subject to confusion with notation for the Islamic [[Hijri year]].\n\n====Previous systems====\nBefore the adoption of the current AM year numbering system, other systems were in use. In early times, the years were counted from some significant historic event. (e.g., {{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:1|HE}}) During the period of the monarchy, it was the widespread practice in western Asia to use era year numbers according to the accession year of the monarch of the country involved. This practice was also followed by the united kingdom of Israel (e.g., {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:25|HE}}), kingdom of Judah (e.g., {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:13|HE}}), kingdom of Israel (e.g., {{bibleverse|2|Kings|17:6|HE}}), Persia (e.g., {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|2:1|HE}}) and others. Besides, the author of Kings coordinated dates in the two kingdoms by giving the accession year of a monarch in terms of the year of the monarch of the other kingdom, (e.g., {{bibleverse|2|Kings|8:16|HE}}) though some commentators note that these dates do not always synchronise.<ref name=\"Thiele\"/> Other era dating systems have been used at other times. For example, Jewish communities in the Babylonian diaspora counted the years from the first deportation from Israel, that of [[Jehoiachin]] in 597 BCE, (e.g., {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:1\u20132|HE}}). The era year was then called \"year of the captivity of Jehoiachin\". (e.g., {{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:27|HE}})\n\nDuring the Hellenistic Maccabean period, [[Seleucid era]] counting was used, at least in the Greek-influenced area of Israel. The [[Books of the Maccabees]] used Seleucid era dating exclusively (e.g., {{bibleverse|1|Maccabees|1:54|NAB}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|6:20|NAB}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|7:1|NAB}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|9:3|NAB}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Maccabees|10:1|NAB}}). [[Josephus]] writing in the Roman period also used Seleucid era dating exclusively. During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th century, the center of world Judaism was in the Middle East, primarily in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academies of Iraq]] and [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel|Palestine]]. Jews in these regions used Seleucid era dating (also known as the \"Era of Contracts\").<ref name=Jones>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvVPlyYjX7YC&pg=PA295 Chronology of the Old Testament, Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones] \"When the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries CE, calculations from the Seleucid era became meaningless. Over those centuries, it was replaced by that of the ''anno mundi'' era of the ''Seder Olam''. From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities.\"</ref> The [[Avodah Zarah]] states:\n\n<blockquote>[[Rav]] [[Aha b. Jacob]] then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all?

In that case, the document is really post-dated!<br> Said [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.

It is also termed Seleucid or Greek Era [H]. Its designation as Alexandrian Era connecting it with Alexander the Great (Maim. Yad, Gerushin 1, 27) is an anachronism, since Alexander died in 323 BCE\u2014eleven years before this Era began (v. E. Mahler, Handbuch der judischen Chronologie, p. 145). This Era, which is first mentioned in Mac. I, 10, and was used by notaries or scribes for dating all civil contracts, was generally in vogue in eastern countries till the 16th cent, and was employed even in the 19th cent, among the Jews of Yemen, in South Arabia (Eben Saphir, Lyck, 1866, p. 62b). (b) THE ERA OF THE DESTRUCTION (of the Second Temple) [H] the year 1 of which corresponds to 381 of the Seleucid Era, and 69\u201370 of the Christian Era. This Era was mainly employed by the Rabbis and was in use in Palestine for several centuries, and even in the later Middle Ages documents were dated by it. One of the recently discovered Genizah documents bears the date 13 Tammuz 987 after the Destruction of the Temple\u2014i.e., 917 C.E. (Op. cit. p. 152, also Marmorstein ZDMG, Vol. VI, p. 640). The difference between the two Eras as far as the tens and units are concerned is thus 20. If therefore a Tanna, say in the year 156 Era of Dest. (225 CE), while remembering, naturally, the century, is uncertain about the tens and units, he should ask the notary what year it is according to his\u2014Seleucid\u2014era. He will get the answer 536 (156 + 380), on adding 20 to which he would get 556, the last two figures giving him the year [1] 56 of the Era of Destruction.\"</ref> being the number of years since the 70 CE [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]]. In the 8th and 9th centuries, as the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, counting using the Seleucid era \"became meaningless\".<ref name=Jones/> There is indication that Jews of the Rhineland in the early Middle Ages used the \"years after the destruction of the Temple\" (e.g., [[s:Mainz Anonymous (Wikisource)|Mainz Anonymous]]).\n\n====New year====\n[[File:Liten askenasisk sjofar 5380.jpg|right|thumb|A ''[[shofar]]'' made from a ram's horn is traditionally blown in observance of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the beginning of the Jewish civic year.]]\n\n{{bibleverse||Exodus|12:2|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deut|16:1|HE}} set Aviv (now [[Nisan]]) as \"the first of months\":\n\n:this month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.\n\nNisan 1 is referred to as the ''ecclesiastical new year''.\n\nIn ancient Israel, the start of the ecclesiastical new year for the counting of months and festivals (i.e., Nisan) was determined by reference to [[Passover]]. Passover is on 15 Nisan, ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:4\u20136|HE}}) which corresponds to the [[full moon]] of Nisan. As Passover is a spring festival, it should fall on a full moon day around, and normally just after, the [[vernal equinox|vernal (northward) equinox]]. If the twelfth full moon after the previous Passover is too early compared to the equinox, a leap month is inserted near the end of the previous year before the new year is set to begin. According to normative Judaism, the verses in {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u20132|HE}} require that the months be determined by a proper court with the necessary authority to sanctify the months. Hence the court, not the astronomy, has the final decision.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Artscroll Chumash |last=Scherman |first=Nosson |date =2005}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some Christian and Karaite sources, the tradition in ancient Israel was that 1 Nisan would not start until the barley is ripe, being the test for the onset of spring.<ref>The barley had to be \"eared out\" (ripe) in order to have a wave-sheaf offering of the first fruits according to the Law. {{Cite book|title=Secrets of Time |last=Jones |first=Stephen |date=1996}}</ref> If the barley was not ripe, an intercalary month would be added before Nisan.\n\nThe day most commonly referred to as the \"New Year\" is 1 Tishrei, which actually begins in the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. On that day the formal New Year for the counting of years (such as [[Shmita]] and [[Jubilee (biblical)|Yovel]]), [[Rosh Hashanah]] (\"head of the year\") is observed. (see {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|40:1|HE}}, which uses the phrase \"beginning of the year\".) This is the '''civil new year''', and the date on which the year number advances. Certain agricultural practices are also marked from this date.<ref>See [[Maaser Rishon]], [[Maaser Sheni]], [[Maaser Ani]].</ref>\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Josephus]] stated that while \u2013\n\n<blockquote>Moses...appointed Nisan...as the first month for the festivals...the commencement of the year for everything relating to divine worship, but for selling and buying and other ordinary affairs he preserved the ancient order [i. e. the year beginning with Tishrei].\"<ref name=\"Josephus, 1930\">Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 1.81, Loeb Classical Library, 1930.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Edwin Thiele]] has concluded that the ancient northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] counted years using the ecclesiastical new year starting on 1 Aviv (Nisan), while the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] counted years using the civil new year starting on 1 Tishrei.<ref name=\"Thiele\">Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257</ref> The practice of the Kingdom of Israel was also that of [[Babylonian calendar|Babylon]],<ref>''The Chronology of the Old Testament'', 16th ed., Floyd Nolan Jones, {{ISBN|978-0-89051-416-0}}, pp. 118\u2013123</ref> as well as other countries of the region.<ref name=\"DeVaux\"/> The practice of Judah is still followed.\n\nIn fact the Jewish calendar has a multiplicity of new years for different purposes. The use of these dates has been in use for a long time. The use of multiple starting dates for a year is comparable to different starting dates for civil \"calendar years\", \"tax or [[fiscal year]]s\", \"[[academic year]]s\", \"religious cycles\", etc. By the time of the redaction of the ''[[Mishnah]]'', [[s:Translation:Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Rosh Hashanah/Chapter 1/1|Rosh Hashanah 1:1]] (c. 200 CE), jurists had identified four new-year dates:\n\n<blockquote>The 1st of Nisan is the new year for kings and feasts; the 1st of Elul is the new year for the tithe of cattle... the 1st of Tishri is the new year for years, of the [[Shmita|years of release]] and [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilee years]], for the planting and for vegetables; and the 1st of Shevat is the new year for trees\u2014so the school of Shammai; and the school of Hillel say: On the 15th thereof.<ref>M. ''Rosh Hashanah'' 1, in Herbert Danby, trans., ''The Mishnah'', Oxford University Press, 1933, p. 188.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe month of [[Elul]] is the new year for counting [[Cattle tithe|animal tithes]] (''ma'aser behemah''). ''[[Tu Bishvat]]'' (\"the 15th of [[Shevat]]\") marks the new year for trees (and agricultural tithes).\n\nFor the dates of the Jewish New Year see [[Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000\u20132050]] or calculate using the section \"Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars\".\n\n====Leap years====\nThe Jewish calendar is based on the [[Metonic cycle]] of 19 years, of which 12 are common (non-leap) years of 12 months and 7 are leap years of 13 months. To determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle. This position is calculated by dividing the Jewish year number by 19 and finding the [[remainder]]. (Since there is no year 0, a remainder of 0 indicates that the year is year 19 of the cycle.) For example, the Jewish year {{#time:xjY}} divided by 19 results in a remainder of {{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}mod 19}}, indicating that it is year {{#ifexpr:{{#time:xjY}}mod 19|{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}mod 19}}|19}} of the Metonic cycle. <ref>See also [[Golden number (time)|Golden number]].</ref>\n\nYears 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of the Metonic cycle are leap years. To assist in remembering this sequence, some people use the mnemonic Hebrew word <nowiki>GUCHADZaT</nowiki> {{hebrew|\"\u05d2\u05d5\u05d7\u05d0\u05d3\u05d6\"\u05d8\"}}, where the Hebrew letters ''gimel-vav-het aleph-dalet-zayin-tet'' are used as [[Hebrew numerals]] equivalent to 3, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 9. The ''keviyah'' records whether the year is leap or common: \u05e4 for ''peshuta'' (\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d4), meaning simple and indicating a common year, and \u05de indicating a leap year (me'uberet, \u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea).<ref name=\"Judaism 101\">{{cite web|title=The Jewish Calendar: A Closer Look|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendr2.htm|publisher=Judaism 101|accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnother memory aid notes that intervals of the [[major scale]] follow the same pattern as do Jewish leap years, with ''do'' corresponding to year 19 (or 0): a [[whole step]] in the scale corresponds to two common years between consecutive leap years, and a [[half step]] to one common year between two leap years. This connection with the major scale is more plain in the context of [[19 equal temperament]]: counting the tonic as 0, the notes of the major scale in 19 equal temperament are numbers 0 (or 19), 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, the same numbers as the leap years in the Hebrew calendar.\n\nA simple rule for determining whether a year is a leap year has been given above. However, there is another rule which not only tells whether the year is leap but also gives the fraction of a month by which the calendar is behind the seasons, useful for agricultural purposes. To determine whether year ''n'' of the calendar is a leap year, find the remainder on dividing [(7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''n'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;1] by 19. If the remainder is 6 or less it is a leap year; if it is 7 or more it is not. For example, the {{Hebrew calendar/c|{{#time:xjY}}}} The {{Hebrew calendar/c|{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}+1}}}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |title=Calendrical Calculations |date=December 2007 |edition=Third |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=91}}</ref> This works because as there are seven leap years in nineteen years the difference between the solar and lunar years increases by 7/19-month per year. When the difference goes above 18/19-month this signifies a leap year, and the difference is reduced by one month.\n\n====Rosh Hashanah postponement rules====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"float; margin: 9px;\"\n! Day of week\n! colspan=\"6\" | Number of days\n|-\n| Monday || 353 || || 355 || 383 || || 385\n|-\n| Tuesday || || 354 || || || 384 ||\n|-\n| Thursday || || 354 || 355 || 383 || || 385\n|-\n| Saturday || 353 || || 355 || 383 || || 385\n|}\n\nTo calculate the day on which Rosh Hashanah of a given year will fall, it is necessary first to calculate the expected [[molad]] (moment of [[lunar conjunction]] or [[new moon]]) of Tishrei in that year, and then to apply a set of rules to determine whether the first day of the year must be postponed. The molad can be calculated by multiplying the number of months that will have elapsed since some (preceding) molad whose weekday is known by the mean length of a (synodic) lunar month, which is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts (there are 1080 \"parts\" in an hour, so that one part is equal to 3{{frac|1|3}} seconds). The very first molad, the [[#Epoch|molad tohu]], fell on Sunday evening at 11.11{{frac|1|3}}, or in Jewish terms Day 2, 5 hours, and 204 parts.\n\nIn calculating the number of months that will have passed since the known molad that one uses as the starting point, one must remember to include any leap months that falls within the elapsed interval, according to the cycle of leap years. A 19-year cycle of 235 synodic months has 991 weeks 2 days 16 hours 595 parts, a common year of 12 synodic months has 50 weeks 4 days 8 hours 876 parts, while a leap year of 13 synodic months has 54 weeks 5 days 21 hours 589 parts.\n\nThe two months whose numbers of days may be adjusted, Marcheshvan and Kislev, are the eighth and ninth months of the Hebrew year, whereas Tishrei is the seventh month (in the traditional counting of the months, even though it is the first month of a new calendar year). Any adjustments needed to postpone Rosh Hashanah must be made to the adjustable months in the year that precedes the year of which the Rosh Hashanah will be the first day.\n\nJust four potential conditions are considered to determine whether the date of Rosh Hashanah must be postponed. These are called the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, or ''de\u1e25iyyot'':<ref name=Ibbur>{{cite book|title=Sefer ha-Ibbur ''(part 2, chapters 9,10)''|author=R.

This is called de\u1e25iyyah ''molad zaken'' (literally, \"old birth\", i.e., late new moon).\n*If the molad occurs on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, Rosh Hashanah is postponed a day. If the application of de\u1e25iyyah ''molad zaken'' would place Rosh Hashanah on one of these days, then it must be postponed a second day. This is called de\u1e25iyyah ''lo ADU,'' an acronym that means \"not [weekday] one, four, or six.\"\n\nThe first of these rules (de\u1e25iyyah ''molad zaken'') is referred to in the Talmud.<ref name=\"epstein\"/> Nowadays, molad zaken is used as a device to prevent the molad falling on the second day of the month.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Landau|first=Remy|url=http://hebrewcalendar.tripod.com/#25|title=Hebrew Calendar Science and Myth: 'The Debatable Dehiyah Molad Zaquen'|access-date=7 February 2015}}</ref> The second rule, (de\u1e25iyyah ''lo ADU''), is applied for religious reasons.\n\nAnother two rules are applied much less frequently and serve to prevent impermissible year lengths. Their names are Hebrew acronyms that refer to the ways they are calculated:\n\n*If the molad in a common year falls on a Tuesday after 9 hours and 204 parts, Rosh Hashanah is postponed to Thursday. This is de\u1e25iyyah ''GaTaRaD'', where the acronym stands for \"3 [Tuesday], 9, 204.\"\n*If the molad following a leap year falls on a Monday, more than 15 hours and 589 parts after the Hebrew day began (for calculation purposes, this is taken to be 6&nbsp;pm Sunday), Rosh Hashanah is postponed to Tuesday. This is de\u1e25iyyah ''BeTUTeKaPoT,'' where the acronym stands for \"2 [Monday], 15, 589.\"\n\nAt the innovation of the sages, the calendar was arranged to ensure that [[Yom Kippur]] would not fall on a Friday or Sunday, and [[Hoshana Rabbah]] would not fall on [[Shabbat]].<ref>This is the reason given by most [[halachic]] authorities, based on the [[Talmud]], Rosh Hashanah 20b and Sukkah 43b. [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Kiddush Hachodesh 7:7), however, writes that the arrangement was made (possible days alternating with impossible ones) in order to average out the difference between the mean and true [[lunar conjunction]]s.</ref> These rules have been instituted because Shabbat restrictions also apply to Yom Kippur, so that if Yom Kippur were to fall on Friday, it would not be possible to make necessary preparations for Shabbat (such as [[Shabbat candles|candle lighting]]). Similarly, if Yom Kippur fell on a Sunday, it would not be possible to make preparations for Yom Kippur because the preceding day is Shabbat.<ref>The Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 20b) puts it differently: over two consecutive days of full Shabbat restrictions, vegetables would wilt (since they can't be cooked), and unburied corpses would putrefy.</ref> Additionally, the laws of Shabbat override those of Hoshana Rabbah, so that if Hoshana Rabbah were to fall on Shabbat certain rituals that are a part of the Hoshana Rabbah service (such as carrying willows, which is a form of work) could not be performed.<ref>Yerushalmi, ''Sukkah'' 54b.</ref>\n\nTo prevent Yom Kippur (10 Tishrei) from falling on a Friday or Sunday, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei) cannot fall on Wednesday or Friday. Likewise, to prevent Hoshana Rabbah (21 Tishrei) from falling on a Saturday, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday. This leaves only four days on which Rosh Hashanah can fall: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, which are referred to as the \"four gates\". Each day is associated with a number (its order in the week, beginning with Sunday as day 1). Numbers in Hebrew have been traditionally denominated by Hebrew letters. Thus the ''keviyah'' uses the letters \u05d4 ,\u05d2 ,\u05d1 and \u05d6 (representing 2, 3, 5, and 7, for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) to denote the starting day of the year.\n\n====Deficient, regular, and complete years====\nThe postponement of the year is compensated for by adding a day to the second month or removing one from the third month. A Jewish common year can only have 353, 354, or 355 days. A leap year is always 30 days longer, and so can have 383, 384, or 385 days.\n\n*A ''chaserah'' year (Hebrew for \"deficient\" or \"incomplete\") is 353 or 383 days long. Both Cheshvan and Kislev have 29 days. The Hebrew letter \u05d7 \"het\" is used in the ''keviyah''.\n*A ''kesidrah'' year (\"regular\" or \"in-order\") is 354 or 384 days long. Cheshvan has 29 days while Kislev has 30 days. The Hebrew letter \u05db \"kaf\" is used in the ''keviyah''.\n*A ''shlemah'' year (\"complete\" or \"perfect\", also \"abundant\") is 355 or 385 days long. Both Cheshvan and Kislev have 30 days. The Hebrew letter \u05e9 \"shin\" is used in the ''keviyah''.\n\nWhether a year is deficient, regular, or complete is determined by the time between two adjacent Rosh Hashanah observances and the leap year. While the ''keviyah'' is sufficient to describe a year, a variant specifies the day of the week for the first day of Pesach ([[Passover]]) in lieu of the year length.\n\nA Metonic cycle equates to 235 lunar months in each 19-year cycle. This gives an average of 6939 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts for each cycle. But due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules (preceding section) a cycle of 19 Jewish years can be either 6939, 6940, 6941, or 6942 days in duration. Since none of these values is evenly divisible by seven, the Jewish calendar repeats exactly only following 36,288 Metonic cycles, or 689,472 Jewish years. There is a near-repetition every 247 years, except for an excess of about 50 minutes (905 parts).\n\n==== Four gates ==== \nThe annual calendar of a numbered Hebrew year, displayed as 12 or 13 months partitioned into weeks, can be determined by consulting the table of Four gates, whose inputs are the year's position in the 19-year cycle and its [[#Rosh Hashanah postponement rules|molad Tishrei]]. The resulting type (''keviyah'') of the desired year in the body of the table is a triple consisting of two numbers and a letter (written left-to-right in English). The left number of each triple is the day of the week of {{nowrap|1 Tishrei}}, Rosh Hashanah {{nowrap|(2 3 5 7)}}; the letter indicates whether that year is deficient (D), regular (R), or complete (C), the number of days in Chesvan and Kislev; while the right number of each triple is the day of the week of {{nowrap|15 Nisan}}, the first day of Passover or Pesach {{nowrap|(1 3 5 7)}}, within the same Hebrew year (next Julian/Gregorian year). The ''keviyah'' in Hebrew letters are written right-to-left, so their days of the week are reversed, the right number for {{nowrap|1 Tishrei}} and the left for {{nowrap|15 Nisan}}. The year within the 19-year cycle alone determines whether that year has one or two Adars.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bushwick |first=Nathan |year=1989 |title=Understanding the Jewish Calendar |location=New York/Jerusalem |publisher=Moznaim |isbn=0-940118-17-3 |pages=95\u201397}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Poznanski |first=Samuel |year=1910 |title=Calendar (Jewish) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics |editor-last=Hastings |editor-first=James |editor-link=James Hastings |title-link=Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics |publisher=T. & T.

It is so named because it identifies the four allowable days of the week on which {{nowrap|1 Tishrei}} can occur.\n\nComparing the days of the week of molad Tishrei with those in the ''keviyah'' shows that during 39% of years {{nowrap|1 Tishrei}} is not postponed beyond the day of the week of its molad Tishrei, 47% are postponed one day, and 14% are postponed two days. This table also identifies the seven types of common years and seven types of leap years. Most are represented in any 19-year cycle, except one or two may be in neighboring cycles. The most likely type of year is 5R7 in 18.1% of years, whereas the least likely is 5C1 in 3.3% of years. The day of the week of {{nowrap|15 Nisan}} is later than that of {{nowrap|1 Tishrei}} by one, two or three days for common years and three, four or five days for leap years in deficient, regular or complete years, respectively.\n\n{| style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|+ '''Four gates'''\n|- style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;\"\n! style=\"border: 1px solid #B0B0B0;

Pritchard, ed., ''The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures'', Vol. 1, Princeton University Press, p. 213.</ref> Furthermore, the Mishnah contains laws that reflect the uncertainties of an empirical calendar. Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event took place on the following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain.<ref>M. ''Sanhedrin'' 5.3: \"If one testifies, 'on the second of the month, and the other, 'on the third of the month:' their evidence is valid, for one may have been aware of the intercalation of the month and the other may not have been aware of it. But if one says, 'on the third', and the other 'on the fifth', their evidence is invalid.\"</ref> Another Mishnah takes it for granted that it cannot be known in advance whether a year's lease is for twelve or thirteen months.<ref>M. ''Baba Metzia'' 8.8.</ref> Hence it is a reasonable conclusion that the Mishnaic calendar was actually used in the Mishnaic period.\n\nThe accuracy of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|Second Temple]] period is less certain. One scholar has noted that there are no laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate any doubts about the length of a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to know in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.<ref>Gandz, Solomon. \"Studies in the Hebrew Calendar: II.

Though the proposals were rejected, they indicate that all of the rules of the modern calendar (except for the epoch) were in place before that date. In 1000, the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] described all of the modern rules of the Hebrew calendar, except that he specified three different epochs used by various Jewish communities being one, two, or three years later than the modern epoch.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThere is a tradition, first mentioned by [[Hai Gaon]] (died 1038 CE), that [[Hillel II|Hillel b. R. Yehuda]] \"in the year 670 of the Seleucid era\" (i.e., 358\u2013359 CE) was responsible for the new calculated calendar with a fixed intercalation cycle. Later writers, such as Nachmanides, explained Hai Gaon's words to mean that the entire computed calendar was due to Hillel b. Yehuda in response to persecution of Jews. Maimonides, in the 12th century, stated that the Mishnaic calendar was used \"until the days of Abaye and Rava\", who flourished c. 320\u2013350 CE, and that the change came when \"the land of Israel was destroyed, and no permanent court was left.\" Taken together, these two traditions suggest that Hillel b. Yehuda (whom they identify with the mid-4th-century Jewish patriarch Ioulos, attested in a letter of the Emperor Julian,<ref>Julian, Letter 25, in John Duncombe, ''Select Works of the Emperor Julian and some Pieces of the Sophist Libanius'', Vol. 2, Cadell, London, 1784, pp. 57\u201362.</ref> and the Jewish patriarch Ellel, mentioned by Epiphanius<ref>Epiphanius, ''Adversus Haereses'' 30.4.1, in Frank Williams, trans., ''The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis Book I (Sections 1\u201346),'' Leiden, E.

Yehuda instituted the complete computed calendar, and the theory that the computed calendar was introduced due to repression or persecution, have been questioned.<ref>Sacha Stern, ''Calendar and Community: A History of the Jewish Calendar Second Century BCE \u2013 Tenth Century CE'', Oxford University Press, 2001.

According to a statement attributed to Yose, an [[Amoraim|Amora]] who lived during the second half of the 3rd century, the feast of [[Purim]], 14 Adar, could not fall on a Sabbath nor a Monday, lest 10 Tishrei ([[Yom Kippur]]) fall on a Friday or a Sunday.<ref>Yerushalmi ''Megillah'' 70b.</ref> This indicates that, by the time of the redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud (c. 400 CE), there were a fixed number of days in all months from Adar to Elul, also implying that the extra month was already a second Adar added before the regular Adar. In another passage, a sage is reported to have counseled \"those who make the computations\" not to set the first day of Tishrei or the Day of the Willow on the sabbath.<ref>Yerushalmi ''Sukkah'' 54b.</ref> This indicates that there was a group who \"made computations\" and were in a position to control, to some extent, the day of the week on which Rosh Hashanah would fall.\n\n===Usage in contemporary Israel===\nEarly [[Zionist]] pioneers were impressed by the fact that the calendar preserved by Jews over many centuries in far-flung diasporas, as a matter of religious ritual, was geared to the climate of their original country: the Jewish New Year marks the transition from the dry season to the rainy one, and major Jewish holidays such as [[Sukkot]], [[Passover]], and [[Shavuot]] correspond to major points of the country's agricultural year such as planting and harvest.\n\nAccordingly, in the early 20th century the Hebrew calendar was re-interpreted as an agricultural rather than religious calendar.\n\nAfter the creation of the [[State of Israel]], the Hebrew calendar became one of the official calendars of Israel, along with the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Holidays and commemorations not derived from previous Jewish tradition were to be fixed according to the Hebrew calendar date. For example, the Israeli Independence Day falls on 5 [[Iyar]], Jerusalem Reunification Day on 28 Iyar, [[Yom HaAliyah]] on 10 Nisan, and the Holocaust Commemoration Day on 27 [[Nisan]].\n\nNevertheless, since the 1950s usage of the Hebrew calendar has steadily declined, in favor of the Gregorian calendar. At present, Israelis\u2014except for the religiously observant\u2014conduct their private and public life according to the Gregorian calendar, although the Hebrew calendar is still widely acknowledged, appearing in public venues such as banks (where it is legal for use on cheques and other documents, though only rarely do people make use of this option) and on the mastheads of newspapers.\n\nThe Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah) is a two-day public holiday in Israel. However, since the 1980s an increasing number of secular Israelis celebrate the Gregorian New Year (usually known as \"[[Silvester]] Night\"\u2014\"\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\") on the night between 31 December and 1 January. Prominent rabbis have on several occasions sharply denounced this practice, but with no noticeable effect on the secularist celebrants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163462#.Upe6pJuA2rY |title=Rabbinate: New Year's Eve Parties 'Not Kosher' |newspaper=[[Arutz Sheva]] |author=David Lev |date=23 December 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nWall calendars commonly used in Israel are hybrids. Most are organised according to Gregorian rather than Jewish months, but begin in September, when the Jewish New Year usually falls, and provide the Jewish date in small characters.\n\n==Other practices==\nOutside of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], evidence shows a diversity of practice.\n\n===Karaite calendar===\nKaraites use the lunar month and the solar year, but the Karaite calendar differs from the current Rabbinic calendar in a number of ways. The Karaite calendar is identical to the Rabbinic calendar used before the Sanhedrin changed the Rabbinic calendar from the lunar, observation based, calendar to the current, mathematically based, calendar used in Rabbinic Judaism today.\n\nIn the lunar Karaite calendar, the beginning of each month, the [[Rosh Chodesh]], can be calculated, but is confirmed by the observation in [[Israel]] of the first sightings of the new moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/new_moon.shtml|title=Karaite Korner \u2013 New Moon and the Hebrew Month|website=www.karaite-korner.org}}</ref> This may result in an occasional variation of a maximum of one day, depending on the inability to observe the new moon. The day is usually \"picked up\" in the next month.\n\nThe addition of the leap month (Adar II) is determined by observing in Israel the ripening of barley at a specific stage (defined by Karaite tradition) (called [[aviv]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/abib.shtml|title=Aviv Barley in the Biblical Calendar \u2013 Nehemia's Wall|date=24 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref> rather than using the calculated and fixed calendar of [[rabbinic Judaism]]. Occasionally this results in Karaites being one month ahead of other Jews using the calculated rabbinic calendar. The \"lost\" month would be \"picked up\" in the next cycle when Karaites would observe a leap month while other Jews would not.\n\nFurthermore, the seasonal drift of the rabbinic calendar is avoided, resulting in the years affected by the drift starting one month earlier in the Karaite calendar.\n\nAlso, the four rules of postponement of the rabbinic calendar are not applied, since they are not mentioned in the [[Tanakh]]. This can affect the dates observed for all the Jewish holidays in a particular year by one or two days.\n\nIn the Middle Ages many [[Karaite Jews]] outside Israel followed the calculated rabbinic calendar, because it was not possible to retrieve accurate aviv barley data from the land of Israel. However, since the establishment of the [[State of Israel]], and especially since the [[Six-Day War]], the Karaite Jews that have made ''[[aliyah]]'' can now again use the observational calendar.\n\n===Samaritan calendar===\nThe [[Samaritan]] community's calendar also relies on lunar months and solar years. Calculation of the Samaritan calendar has historically been a secret reserved to the priestly family alone,<ref name=\"Sam1\">{{cite web|title=The Samaritan Calendar|url=http://shomron0.tripod.com/articles/samaritancalendar.pdf|website=www.thesamaritanupdate.com|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=2008}}</ref> and was based on observations of the new crescent moon. More recently, a 20th-century [[Samaritan High Priest]] transferred the calculation to a computer algorithm. The current High Priest confirms the results twice a year, and then distributes calendars to the community.<ref name=\"Sam2\">{{cite web|last1=Benyamim|first1=Tzedaka|title=Calendar|url=https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/religion/calendar/|website=www.israelite-samaritans.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe epoch of the Samaritan calendar is year of the entry of the [[Children of Israel]] into the [[Land of Israel]] with [[Joshua]]. The month of Passover is the first month in the Samaritan calendar, but the year number increments in the sixth month. Like in the Rabbinic calendar, there are seven leap years within each 19-year cycle. However, the Rabbinic and Samaritan calendars' cycles are not synchronized, so Samaritan festivals\u2014notionally the same as the Rabbinic festivals of Torah origin\u2014are frequently one month off from the date according to the Rabbinic calendar. Additionally, as in the Karaite calendar, the Samaritan calendar does not apply the four rules of postponement, since they are not mentioned in the [[Tanakh]]. This can affect the dates observed for all the Jewish holidays in a particular year by one or two days.<ref name=\"Sam1\" /><ref name=\"Sam2\" />\n\n===The Qumran calendar===\n{{See also|Enoch calendar|Qumran calendrical texts}}\nMany of the Dead Sea (Qumran) Scrolls have references to a unique calendar, used by the people there, who are often assumed to be Essenes.\n\nThe year of this calendar used the ideal Mesopotamian calendar of twelve 30-day months, to which were added 4 days at the equinoxes and solstices (cardinal points), making a total of 364 days.\n\nThere was some ambiguity as to whether the cardinal days were at the beginning of the months or at the end, but the clearest calendar attestations give a year of four seasons, each having three months of 30, 30, and 31 days with the cardinal day the extra day at the end, for a total of 91 days, or exactly 13 weeks. Each season started on the 4th day of the week (Wednesday), every year. (Ben-Dov, ''Head of All Years'', pp.&nbsp;16\u201317)\n\nWith only 364 days, it is clear that the calendar would after a few years be very noticeably different from the actual seasons, but there is nothing to indicate what was done about this problem. Various suggestions have been made by scholars. One is that nothing was done and the calendar was allowed to change with respect to the seasons. Another suggestion is that changes were made irregularly, only when the seasonal anomaly was too great to be ignored any longer. (Ben-Dov, ''Head of All Years'', pp.&nbsp;19\u201320)\n\nThe writings often discuss the moon, but the calendar was not based on the movement of the moon any more than indications of the phases of the moon on a modern western calendar indicate that that is a lunar calendar. Recent analysis of one of the last scrolls remaining to be deciphered has revealed it relates to this calendar and that the sect used the word ''tekufah'' to identify each of the four special days marking the transitions between the seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/techandscience/one-of-the-last-dead-sea-scroll-mysteries-has-been-deciphered/ar-AAv2Raz?li=AAnZ9Ug&ocid=iehp|last=Glowatz|first=Elana|title=One Of The Last Dead Sea Scroll Mysteries Has Been Deciphered|website=International Business Times|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Persian civil calendar===\nCalendrical evidence for the postexilic Persian period is found in [[Elephantine papyri|papyri]] from the Jewish colony at [[Elephantine]], in Egypt.

Neue Folge, Band viii, Berlin, 1905.</ref> Some of the dates in the document are clearly corrupt, but they can be emended to make the sixteen years in the table consistent with a regular intercalation scheme. Peter, the bishop of Alexandria (early 4th century CE), mentions that the Jews of his city \"hold their Passover according to the course of the moon in the month of [[Paremhat|Phamenoth]], or according to the intercalary month every third year in the month of [[Paremoude|Pharmuthi]]\",<ref>Peter of Alexandria, quoted in the ''Chronicon Paschale''. ''Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae, Chronicon Paschale'' Vol. 1, Weber, Bonn, 1832, p. 7</ref> suggesting a fairly consistent intercalation scheme that kept Nisan 14 approximately between Phamenoth 10 (March 6 in the 4th century CE) and Pharmuthi 10 (April 5). Jewish funerary inscriptions from Zoar, south of the Dead Sea, dated from the 3rd to the 5th century, indicate that when years were intercalated, the intercalary month was at least sometimes a repeated month of Adar. The inscriptions, however, reveal no clear pattern of regular intercalations, nor do they indicate any consistent rule for determining the start of the lunar month.<ref>Sacha Stern, Calendar and Community, pp. 87\u201397, 146\u2013153.</ref>\n\nIn 1178, [[Maimonides]] included all the rules for the calculated calendar and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. Today, the rules detailed in Maimonides' code are those generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.\n\n==Astronomical calculations==\n\n===Synodic month \u2013 the molad interval===\nA \"[[new moon]]\" (astronomically called a [[lunar conjunction]] and, in Hebrew, a [[molad]]) is the moment at which the sun and moon are aligned horizontally with respect to a north-south line (technically, they have the same ecliptical longitude). The period between two new moons is a [[synodic month]]. The actual length of a synodic month varies from about 29 days 6 hours and 30 minutes (29.27 days) to about 29 days and 20 hours (29.83 days), a variation range of about 13 hours and 30 minutes. Accordingly, for convenience, a long-term average length, identical to the '''mean synodic month''' of ancient times (also called the molad interval) is used. The molad interval is <math>\\tfrac{765433}{25920}</math> days, or 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 \"parts\" (1 \"part\" = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>18</sub> minute; 3 \"parts\" = 10 seconds) (i.e., 29.530594 days), and is the same value determined by the Babylonians in their [[Babylonian mathematics|System B]] about 300 BCE<ref name=Neugebauer2>Neugebauer, ''Astronomical cuneiform texts'', Vol 1, pp 271\u2013273</ref> and was adopted by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] in the 2nd century BCE and by the Alexandrian astronomer [[Ptolemy]] in the ''[[Almagest]]'' four centuries later (who cited Hipparchus as his source). Its remarkable accuracy (less than one second from the true value) is thought to have been achieved using records of lunar eclipses from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE.<ref>[[G. J. Toomer]], Hipparchus' Empirical Basis for his Lunar Mean Motions, ''Centaurus'', Vol 24, 1980, pp. 97\u2013109</ref>\n\nThis value is as close to the correct value of 29.530589 days as it is possible for a value to come that is rounded off to whole \"parts\". The discrepancy makes the molad interval about 0.6 seconds too long. Put another way, if the molad is taken as the time of mean conjunction at some reference meridian, then this reference meridian is drifting slowly eastward. If this drift of the reference meridian is traced back to the mid-4th century, the traditional date of the introduction of the fixed calendar, then it is found to correspond to a longitude midway between the [[Nile]] and the end of the [[Euphrates]]. The modern molad moments match the mean solar times of the lunar conjunction moments near the meridian of [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], more than [[longitude|30\u00b0]] east of Jerusalem.\n\nFurthermore, the discrepancy between the molad interval and the mean synodic month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational [[tide|tidal]] effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale, such as that provided by an [[atomic clock]], the mean synodic month is becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean synodic month is becoming gradually shorter in terms of mean solar time.\n\n===Seasonal drift===\nThe mean year of the current mathematically based Hebrew calendar is 365 days 5 hours 55 minutes and 25+<sup>25</sup>/<sub>57</sub> seconds (365.2468 days) \u2013 computed as the molad/monthly interval of 29.530594 days \u00d7 235 months in a 19-year metonic cycle \u00f7 19 years per cycle. In relation to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the mean Gregorian calendar year is 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and 12 seconds (365.2425 days), and the drift of the Hebrew calendar in relation to it is about a day every 231 years.\n\n===Implications for Jewish ritual===\n[[File:DetailOfMedievalHebrewCalendar.jpg|thumb|right|This figure, in a detail of a medieval Hebrew calendar, reminded Jews of the [[palm tree|palm branch]] ([[Lulav]]), the myrtle twigs, the willow branches, and the [[citron]] ([[Etrog]]) to be held in the hand and to be brought to the synagogue during the holiday of [[Sukkot]], which occurs in autumn.]]\nAlthough the molad of Tishrei is the only molad moment that is not ritually announced, it is actually the only one that is relevant to the Hebrew calendar, for it determines the provisional date of Rosh Hashanah, subject to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules. The other monthly molad moments are announced for mystical reasons. With the moladot on average almost 100 minutes late, this means that the molad of Tishrei lands one day later than it ought to in (100 minutes) \u00f7 (1440 minutes per day) = 5 of 72 years or nearly 7% of years.\n\nTherefore, the seemingly small drift of the moladot is already significant enough to affect the date of Rosh Hashanah, which then cascades to many other dates in the calendar year and sometimes, due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, also interacts with the dates of the prior or next year. The molad drift could be corrected by using a progressively shorter molad interval that corresponds to the actual mean lunar conjunction interval at the original molad reference meridian. Furthermore, the molad interval determines the calendar mean year, so using a progressively shorter molad interval would help correct the excessive length of the Hebrew calendar mean year, as well as helping it to \"hold onto\" the northward equinox for the maximum duration.\n\nWhen the 19-year intercalary cycle was finalised in the 4th century, the earliest Passover (in year 16 of the cycle) coincided with the northward equinox, which means that Passover fell near the ''first'' full moon after the northward equinox, or that the northward equinox landed within one lunation before 16 days after the ''molad'' of ''Nisan''. This is still the case in about 80% of years; but, in about 20% of years, Passover is a month late by these criteria (as it was in AM 5765 and 5768, the 8th and 11th years of the 19-year cycle = Gregorian 2005 and 2008 CE). Presently, this occurs after the \"premature\" insertion of a leap month in years 8, 11, and 19 of each 19-year cycle, which causes the northward equinox to land on exceptionally early Hebrew dates in such years. This problem will get worse over time, and so beginning in AM 5817 (2057 CE), year 3 of each 19-year cycle will also be a month late. If the calendar is not amended, then Passover will start to land on or after the summer solstice around AM 16652 (12892 CE). (The exact year when this will begin to occur depends on uncertainties in the future tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate, and on the accuracy of predictions of precession and Earth axial tilt.)\n\nThe seriousness of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted on the grounds that Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. The Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and at least part of the harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional ''succah'' during Sukkot. The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until ''Shemini Atzeret'', after the end of Sukkot, yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.\n\nNo equinox or solstice will ever be more than a day or so away from its mean date according to the solar calendar, while nineteen Jewish years average 6939d 16h 33m 03{{fraction|1|3}}s compared to the 6939d 14h 26m 15s of nineteen mean tropical years.<ref>Weinberg, I., ''Astronomical Aspects of the Jewish Calendar'', Monthly Notes of the Astronomical Society of South Africa, Vol. 15, p. 86; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1956MNSSA..15...86W]</ref> This discrepancy has mounted up to six days, which is why the earliest Passover currently falls on 26 March (as in AM 5773 / 2013 CE).\n\n===Worked example===\nGiven the length of the year, the length of each month is fixed as described above, so the real problem in determining the calendar for a year is determining the number of days in the year. In the modern calendar, this is determined in the following manner.<ref>The following description is based on the article \"Calendar\" in Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem: Ketter, 1972). It is an explanatory description, not a procedural one, in particular explaining what is going on with the third and fourth ''de\u1e25iyyot''</ref>\n\nThe day of Rosh Hashanah and the length of the year are determined by the time and the day of the week of the Tishrei ''molad'', that is, the moment of the average conjunction. Given the Tishrei ''molad'' of a certain year, the length of the year is determined as follows:\n\nFirst, one must determine whether each year is an ordinary or leap year by its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle. Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are leap years.\n\nSecondly, one must determine the number of days between the starting Tishrei ''molad'' (TM1) and the Tishrei ''molad'' of the next year (TM2). For calendar descriptions in general the day begins at 6 p.m., but for the purpose of determining Rosh Hashanah, a ''molad'' occurring on or after noon is treated as belonging to the next day (the first ''de\u1e25iyyah'').<ref>So for example if the Tishrei molad is calculated as occurring from noon on Wednesday (the 18th hour of the fourth day) up until noon on Thursday, Rosh Hashanah falls on a Thursday, which starts Wednesday at sunset wherever one happens to be.</ref> All months are calculated as 29d, 12h, 44m, 3{{fraction|1|3}}s long (MonLen). Therefore, in an ordinary year TM2 occurs 12 \u00d7 MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 354 calendar days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after 3:11:20&nbsp;a.m. and before noon, it will be 355 days. Similarly, in a leap year, TM2 occurs 13 \u00d7 MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 384 days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after noon and before 2:27:16{{fraction|2|3}} p.m., TM2 will be only 383 days after TM1. In the same way, from TM2 one calculates TM3. Thus the four natural year lengths are 354, 355, 383, and 384 days.\n\nHowever, because of the holiday rules, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, so if TM2 is one of those days, Rosh Hashanah in year 2 is postponed by adding one day to year 1 (the second ''de\u1e25iyyah''). To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2. It is to allow for these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.\n\nBut how can year 1 be lengthened if it is already a long ordinary year of 355 days or year 2 be shortened if it is a short leap year of 383 days? That is why the third and fourth ''de\u1e25iyyah''s are needed.\n\nIf year 1 is already a long ordinary year of 355 days, there will be a problem if TM1 is on a Tuesday,<ref>This will happen if TM1 is on or after 3:11:20 a.m. and before noon on a Tuesday. If TM1 is Monday, Thursday or Saturday, Rosh Hashanah in year 2 does not need to be postponed. If TM1 is Sunday, Wednesday or Friday, Rosh Hashanah in year 1 is postponed, so year 1 is not the maximum length.</ref> as that means TM2 falls on a Sunday and will have to be postponed, creating a 356-day year. In this case, Rosh Hashanah in year 1 is postponed from Tuesday (the third ''de\u1e25iyyah''). As it cannot be postponed to Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday, and year 1 ends up with 354 days.\n\nOn the other hand, if year 2 is already a short year of 383 days, there will be a problem if TM2 is on a Wednesday.<ref>TM2 will be between noon and 2:27:16{{fraction|2|3}} p.m. on Tuesday, and TM3 will be between 9:32:43{{fraction|1|3}} and noon on Monday.</ref> because Rosh Hashanah in year 2 will have to be postponed from Wednesday to Thursday and this will cause year 2 to be only 382 days long. In this case, year 2 is extended by one day by postponing Rosh Hashanah in year 3 from Monday to Tuesday (the fourth ''de\u1e25iyyah''), and year 2 will have 383 days.\n\n==Rectifying the Hebrew calendar==\nThe attribution of the fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar solely to [[Hillel II]] has, however, been questioned by a few authors, such as Sasha Stern, who claim that the calendar rules developed gradually over several centuries.<ref name=Stern/>\n\nGiven the importance in Jewish ritual of establishing the accurate timing of monthly and annual times, some [[futurist]] writers and researchers have considered whether a \"corrected\" system of establishing the Hebrew date is required. The mean year of the current mathematically based Hebrew calendar has \"drifted\" an average of 7\u20138 days late relative to the equinox relationship that it originally had. It is not possible, however, for any individual Hebrew date to be a week or more \"late\", because Hebrew months always begin within a day or two of the ''[[molad]]'' moment. What happens instead is that the traditional Hebrew calendar \"prematurely\" inserts a leap month one year before it \"should have been\" inserted, where \"prematurely\" means that the insertion causes the spring equinox to land more than 30 days before the latest acceptable moment, thus causing the calendar to run \"one month late\" until the time when the leap month \"should have been\" inserted prior to the following spring. This presently happens in 4 years out of every 19-year cycle (years 3, 8, 11, and 19), implying that the Hebrew calendar currently runs \"one month late\" more than 21% of the time.\n\nDr. Irv Bromberg has proposed a 353-year cycle of 4366 months, which would include 130 leap months, along with use of a progressively shorter ''molad'' interval, which would keep an amended fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar from drifting for more than seven millennia.<ref>Bromberg, Irv. {{Cite web|title=The Rectified Hebrew Calendar.|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/rect.htm|accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref> It takes about 3{{frac|1|2}} centuries for the spring equinox to drift an average of {{frac|1|19}}th of a ''molad'' interval earlier in the Hebrew calendar. That is a very important time unit, because it can be cancelled by simply truncating a 19-year cycle to 11 years, omitting 8 years including three leap years from the sequence. That is the essential feature of the 353-year leap cycle ({{nowrap|1= (9 \u00d7 19) + '''11''' + (9 \u00d7 19) = 353 years}}).\n\nReligious questions abound about how such a system might be implemented and administered throughout the diverse aspects of the world Jewish community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php/Committee_concerning_the_fixing_of_the_Calendar|title=Committee concerning the fixing of the Calendar \u2013 The Sanhedrin English|website=www.thesanhedrin.org}}</ref>\n\n==Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars==\nThe list below gives a time which can be used to determine the day the Jewish ecclesiastical (spring) year starts over a period of nineteen years:\n\n:20:18 <math>\\tfrac{15}{18}</math> Monday, 31 March 2014\n:05:07 <math>\\tfrac{9}{18}</math> Saturday, 21 March 2015\n:02:40 <math>\\tfrac{4}{18}</math> Friday, 8 April 2016\n:11:28 <math>\\tfrac{16}{18}</math> Tuesday, 28 March 2017\n:20:17 <math>\\tfrac{10}{18}</math> Saturday, 17 March 2018\n:17:50 <math>\\tfrac{5}{18}</math> Friday, 5 April 2019\n:02:38 <math>\\tfrac{17}{18}</math> Wednesday, 25 March 2020\n:11:27 <math>\\tfrac{11}{18}</math> Sunday, 14 March 2021\n:09:00 <math>\\tfrac{6}{18}</math> Saturday, 2 April 2022\n:17:49 Wednesday, 22 March 2023\n:15:21 <math>\\tfrac{13}{18}</math> Tuesday, 9 April 2024\n:00:10 <math>\\tfrac{7}{18}</math> Sunday, 30 March 2025\n:08:59 <math>\\tfrac{1}{18}</math> Thursday, 19 March 2026\n:06:31 <math>\\tfrac{14}{18}</math> Wednesday, 7 April 2027\n:15:20 <math>\\tfrac{8}{18}</math> Sunday, 26 March 2028\n:00:09 <math>\\tfrac{2}{18}</math> Friday, 16 March 2029\n:21:41 <math>\\tfrac{15}{18}</math> Wednesday, 3 April 2030\n:06:30 <math>\\tfrac{9}{18}</math> Monday, 24 March 2031\n:15:19 <math>\\tfrac{3}{18}</math> Friday, 12 March 2032\n\nEvery nineteen years this time is 2 days, 16 hours, 33 1/18 minutes later in the week. That is either the same or the previous day in the civil calendar, depending on whether the difference in the day of the week is three or two days. If 29 February is included fewer than five times in the nineteen \u2013 year period the date will be later by the number of days which corresponds to the difference between the actual number of insertions and five. If the year is due to start on Sunday, it actually begins on the following Tuesday if the following year is due to start on Friday morning.

The civil calendar used here (Exigian) is correct to one day in 44,000 years and omits the leap day in centennial years which do not give remainder 200 or 700 when divided by 900.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Cassidy|first=Simon|url=http://hermetic.ch/cal_stud/cassidy/howlong.htm|title=Re: How long is a year..EXACTLY?

Ignore any fraction of a day. When the difference between the calendars changes the calculated value applies on and from March 1 (civil date) for conversions to Julian. For earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from February 29 (Julian date). Again, for earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting '''into'''. A negative value indicates that the Julian date is ahead of the civil date. In this case it is important to remember that when calculating the civil equivalent of February 29 (Julian), February 29 is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is \u22124 the civil equivalent of this date is February 24. Before 1 CE use astronomical years rather than years BCE. The astronomical year is (year BCE) \u2013 1.\n\nUp to the 4th century CE, these tables give the day of the Jewish month to within a day or so and the number of the month to within a month or so. From the 4th century, the number of the month is given exactly and from the 9th century the day of the month is given exactly as well.\n\nIn the Julian calendar, every 76 years the Jewish year is due to start 5h 47 14/18m earlier, and 3d 18h 12 4/18m later in the week.\n\n;Example calculation\n\nOn what civil date does the eighth month begin in CE 20874-5?\n\n20874=2026+(248x76). In (248x76) Julian years the Jewish year is due to start (248x3d 18h 12 4/18m) later in the week, which is 932d 2h 31 2/18m or 1d 2h 31 2/18m later after removing complete weeks. Allowing for the current difference of thirteen days between the civil and Julian calendars, the Julian date is 13+(248x0d 5h 47 4/18m) earlier, which is 72d 21h 28 16/18m earlier. Convert back to the civil calendar by applying the formula.\n\n:20874+300=21174\n:211x7=1477\n:1477/9=164 remainder 1\n:164-4=160.\n:160d-72d 21h 28 16/18m=87d 2h 31 2/18m.\n\nSo, in 20874 CE, the Jewish year is due to begin 87d 2h 31 2/18m later than in 2026 CE and 1d 2h 31 2/18m later in the week. In 20874 CE, therefore, the Jewish year is due to begin at 11.30 3/18 A.M. on Friday, 14 June. Because of the displacements, it actually begins on Saturday, 15 June. Odd months have 30 days and even months 29, so the starting dates are 2, 15 July; 3, 13 August; 4, 12 September; 5, 11 October; 6, 10 November; 7, 9 December, and 8, 8 January.\n\nThe rules are based on the theory that Maimonides explains in his book \"Rabbinical Astronomy\"<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Feldman|first=W M|title=Rabbinical Mathematics and Astronomy:Judaic Studies Library; no.

Finkelstein]], in which the author argues that the [[American Jews|American Jew]]ish [[The Establishment|establishment]] exploits the memory of the [[Nazi]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] for political and financial gain, as well as to further the interests of [[Israel]].<ref>See article on [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=11 Norman Finklestein's webpage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814082201/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3 |date=2012-08-14 }}.</ref> According to Finkelstein, this \"Holocaust industry\" has corrupted [[Jewish culture]] and the authentic memory of the Holocaust.\n\n==Finkelstein on the book==\nFinkelstein states that his consciousness of \"the Nazi holocaust\" is rooted in his parents' experiences in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]; with the exception of his parents themselves, \"every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis\".<ref name=h5>The Holocaust Industry, p. 5-8.</ref> Nonetheless, during his childhood, no one ever asked any questions about what his mother and father had suffered. He suggests,  \"This was not a respectful silence. It was indifference.\"<ref name=h5 /> It was only after the establishment of \"the Holocaust industry\", he suggests, that outpourings of anguish over the plight of the Jews in [[World War II]] began.  This ideology in turn served to endow Israel with a status as \"'victim' state\" despite its \"horrendous\" human rights record.<ref name=h5 />\n\nAccording to Finkelstein, his book is \"an anatomy and an indictment of the Holocaust industry\". He argues that \"'The Holocaust' is an ideological representation of the Nazi holocaust\".<ref>The Holocaust Industry, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn the foreword to the first [[paperback]] edition, Finkelstein notes that the first hardback edition had been a considerable hit in several European countries and many languages, but had been largely ignored in the [[United States]]. He sees ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the main promotional vehicle of the \"Holocaust industry\", and notes that the 1999 Index listed 273 entries for the Holocaust and just 32 entries for the entire continent of [[Africa]].\n\n==Chapters==\n*Chapter 1: ''Capitalizing The Holocaust'' - by the 1980s, Finkelstein states, the \"War against the Jews\" had become more important to American cultural life than the \"War Between the States\".(p.&nbsp;11)\n*Chapter 2: ''Hoaxers, Hucksters and History'' - in 1967, Finkelstein claims that two concepts appeared in public discourse: The uniqueness of the Holocaust, and the concept of the Holocaust as climax of a historical irrational [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] tendency in Europe. Finkelstein asserts that these concepts became central to the \"Holocaust Industry\", but that neither figures in scholarship of the Nazi Holocaust.(p.&nbsp;13)\n*Chapter 3: ''The Double Shakedown'' - in this chapter, Finkelstein claims that the number of Jewish [[Holocaust survivors|survivors of the Holocaust]] recognized by relief groups increased from c. 100,000 in 1945<ref>Henry Friedlander, \"Darkness and Dawn in 1945: The Nazis, the Allies, and the Survivors,\" in US Holocaust Memorial Museum, 1945 - the Year of Liberation (Washington: 1995), 11-35. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.81.</ref> to nearly 1 million<ref>1997 study commissioned by the Israeli Prime Minister's office.(p.67)</ref> owing to definitional changes in who was considered to be a survivor. Because of this, Finkelstein repeatedly asserts that fraudulent claims were made on Switzerland, while accounts and assets in the US and Israel were ignored. Payments were made to the wrong people and real survivors lost out.\nThe second (2003) edition contained 100 pages of new material, primarily in chapter 3 on the [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks]]. Finkelstein set out to provide a guide to the relevant sections of the case. He feels that the presiding judge elected not to docket crucial documents, and that the Claims Resolution Tribunal could no longer be trusted. Finkelstein claims the CRT was on course to vindicate the Swiss banks before it changed tack in order to \"protect the blackmailers' reputation\".\n\n==Reviews and critiques==\n{{POV section|date=December 2014}}\nThe critical response has been varied. In addition to prominent supporters, such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Alexander Cockburn]], the Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] is on record as praising Finkelstein's book:  \n{{quote|I refer now to the part of the book that deals with the claims against the Swiss banks, and the other claims pertaining to forced labor. I would now say in retrospect that he was actually conservative, moderate and that his conclusions are trustworthy. He is a well-trained [[political scientist]], has the ability to do the research, did it carefully, and has come up with the right results. I am by no means the only one who, in the coming months or years, will totally agree with Finkelstein's breakthrough.<ref>Jon Wiener,[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050711/wiener/2 \"Giving Chutzpah New Meaning,\"] TheNation.com (June 23, 2005). Further statements made by Hilberg on the work are available at NormanFinkelstein.com [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=202 ''Raul Hilberg interviews on The Holocaust Industry & Finkelstein (2000/2001)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327144638/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=202 |date=2006-03-27 }}.</ref>}}\nOn the other hand, many have argued that ''The Holocaust Industry'' is an unscholarly work that promotes [[antisemitic]] [[stereotype]]s. For example, according to [[Israelis|Israeli]] journalist [[Yair Sheleg]], in August 2000, German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] called it \"a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?PG=3&AR=11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814082201/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3 |archivedate=2012-08-14 |df= }}</ref> [[Wolfgang Benz]] stated to ''[[Le Monde]]'': \"It is impossible to learn anything from Finkelstein's book. At best, it is interesting for a psychotherapist.\"<ref>\"Pol\u00e9mique et curiosit\u00e9 en Allemagne\", ''Le Monde'', 16 February 2001.</ref> The reviewer of this daily added that Norman Finkelstein \"hardly cares about nuance\"<ref>[[Jean Birnbaum]], \"Le d\u00e9bat s'ouvre autour du livre contest\u00e9 \u00ab L'Industrie de l'Holocauste \u00bb\", ''Le Monde'', February 16, 2001.</ref> and [[Rony Brauman]] wrote in the preface to the French edition (''L'Industrie de l'Holocauste'', Paris, La Fabrique, 2001) that some assertions of N. Finkelstein (especially on the impact of the [[Six-days war]]) are wrong, others being pieces of \"propaganda\".\n\nUniversity of Chicago Professor [[Peter Novick]], whose work Finkelstein described as providing the \"initial stimulus\" for ''The Holocaust Industry'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VrqK5VdO2i0C&pg=PA4&dq=%22initial+stimulus+for+this+book+was+Peter+Novick%27s+seminal+study%22&sig=x2OveMwYQ1YeVM_U08DYFFhRcYk The Holocaust Industry, p. 4.]</ref> asserted in the July 28, 2000 ''Jewish Chronicle'' (London) that the book is replete with \"false accusations\", \"egregious misrepresentations\", \"absurd claims\" and \"repeated mis-statements\" (\"A charge into darkness that sheds no light\"). Finkelstein replied to the allegations by Novick on his homepage.<ref>http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=165</ref>\n\n[[Hasia Diner]] has accused Peter Novick and Finkelstein of being \"harsh critics of American Jewry from the left,\" and challenges the notion reflected in their books that American Jews did not begin to commemorate the Holocaust until post 1967.<ref>All Quiet; Were postwar American Jews really \u2018silent\u2019 about the Holocaust? BY ADAM KIRSCH | 7:00 am June 23, 2009, [[Tablet Magazine]] [http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/books/all-quiet121/]</ref>\n\nAndrew Ross, reviewing the book for ''[[Salon magazine|Salon]]'', wrote:\n\n{{quote|On the issue of [[reparation (legal)|reparations]], he barely acknowledges the wrongs committed by the Swiss and German institutions &mdash; the burying of Jewish bank accounts, the use of [[slave labor]] &mdash; that gave rise to the recent reparations drive. The fear that the reparations will not wind up in the hands of those who need and deserve them most is a legitimate concern. But the idea that survivors have been routinely swindled by Jewish institutions is a gross distortion. The chief reason why survivors have so far seen nothing of the $1.25 billion Swiss settlement, reached in 1998, is that U.S. courts have yet to rule on a method of distribution. On other reparations and compensation settlements, the [[Claims Conference]], a particular bete noire of Finkelstein, says that it distributed approximately $220 million to individual survivors in 1999 alone.<ref>From Salon Magazine September 6, 2000 {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/books/reviews/09/06/salon.review.holocaust/ |title=''REVIEW: 'THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY' '' |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407180501/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/books/reviews/09/06/salon.review.holocaust/ |archivedate=April 7, 2004 |df= }} by Andrew Ross</ref>}}\n\n===Finkelstein's response to critics===\nFinkelstein responded to his critics in the foreword to the second edition:\n\n{{quote|Mainstream critics allege that I conjured a \"[[conspiracy theory]]\" while those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] ridicule the book as a defense of \"the [[bank]]s\".  None, so far as I can tell, question my actual findings.}}\n\n==Other topics==\n\n===Fraudulent writings on the Holocaust===\nFinkelstein describes two known frauds, that of ''[[The Painted Bird]]'' by Polish writer [[Jerzy Kosinski]] and ''Fragments'' by [[Binjamin Wilkomirski]], and how they were defended by people even after they had been exposed. He identifies some of these people as members of the \"Holocaust Industry\", and notes that they also support each other. [[Elie Wiesel]] supported Kosinski; [[Israel Gutman]] and [[Daniel Goldhagen]] (see below) supported Wilkomirski; Wiesel and Gutman support Goldhagen.\n\n===Other genocides===\nFinkelstein scathingly compared the media treatment of the Holocaust and the media treatment of other genocides such as the [[Holodomor]] and the [[Armenian Genocide]], particularly by members of what he calls \"The Holocaust Industry\". 1 to 1.5 million Armenians died in the years between 1915 and 1917/1923 - [[Armenian Genocide denial|denial]] includes the claim that they were the result of a civil war within [[World War I]], or refusal to accept there were deaths. In 2001, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] went so far as to dismiss it as \"allegations\". However, by this time historical consensus was changing, and he was \"angrily compared ... to a holocaust denier\" by [[Israel Charny]], executive director of the [[Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/peres-stands-accused-over-denial-of-meaningless-armenian-holocaust-681774.html Peres stands accused over denial of `meaningless' Armenian Holocaust\"]. Findarticle archive of Independent 18 April 2001. Verified 22 Jun 2008.</ref>\n\n===Other forms of Holocaust denial===\nAccording to Finkelstein, Elie Wiesel characterized any suggestion that he has profited from the \"Holocaust Industry\", or even any criticism at all, as [[Holocaust denial]].<ref>Wiesel, All Rivers, 333, 336. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70.</ref> Questioning a survivor's testimony, denouncing the role of Jewish collaborators, suggesting that Germans suffered during the [[bombing of Dresden]] or that any state except Germany committed crimes in World War II are all evidence of Holocaust denial \u2013 according to [[Deborah Lipstadt]]<ref>Lipstadt, Denying, 6, 12, 22, 89-90. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70.</ref> \u2013 and the most \"insidious\" forms of Holocaust denial are \"immoral equivalencies\", denying the [[uniqueness of The Holocaust]].<ref>Lipstadt, Denying, chapter 11. Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70.</ref> Finkelstein examines the implications of applying this standard to another member of the \"Holocaust Industry\", Daniel Goldhagen, who argued that [[Serbia]]n actions in [[Kosovo]] \"are, in their essence, different from those of Nazi Germany only in scale\".<ref>\"A New Serbia\" in New Republic (17 May 1999). Cited in the 2003 edition of HI on p.70.</ref>\n\n===Holocaust deniers in real life===\n{{Further|Armenian Genocide recognition|Holocaust denial}}\nAccording to Finkelstein, Deborah Lipstadt claims there is widespread Holocaust denial - yet in ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' (1993) her prime example is [[Arthur Butz]], author of ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]''. The chapter on him is entitled \"Entering the Mainstream\" - but Finkelstein considers that, were it not for the likes of Lipstadt, no one would ever have heard of Arthur Butz. Holocaust deniers have as much influence in the US as the [[Flat Earth Society]] (p.&nbsp;69). Finkelstein believes there to be only one \"truly mainstream\" holocaust denier&mdash;[[Bernard Lewis]], who was convicted in France of denying the Armenian genocide.<ref>\"France Fines Historian Over Armenian Denial,\" in ''Boston Globe'' (22 June 1995), and \"Bernard Lewis and the Armenians,\" in ''Counterpunch'' (16\u201331 December 1997).

Lecture at the Wiccan Conference in Canberra, 1991.</ref> and [[Thelema]], were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western [[occultism]].<ref>Jenkins, Phillip (2000) ''Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History'', pg. 74. \"Also in the 1880s, the tradition of ritual magic was revived in London by a group of Masonic adepts, who formed the Order of the Golden Dawn, which would prove an incalculable influence on the whole subsequent history of occultism.\" USA: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Smoley, Richard (1999) ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'', ppg 102-103. \"Founded in 1888, the Golden Dawn lasted a mere twelve years before it was shattered by personal conflicts. At its height it probably had no more than a hundred members. Yet its influence on magic and esoteric thought in the English-speaking world would be hard to overestimate.\" USA: Quest Books.</ref>\n\nThe three founders, [[William Robert Woodman]], [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Samuel Liddell Mathers]], were [[Freemasons]]. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn.\n\nThe Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the [[Masonic lodge]]s; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men. The \"Golden Dawn\" was the first of three Orders, although all three are often collectively referred to as the \"Golden Dawn\". The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the [[Hermetic Qabalah]] and personal development through study and awareness of the [[Classical Elements|four Classical Elements]] as well as the basics of [[astrology]], [[tarot divination]], and [[geomancy]]. The Second or \"Inner\" Order, the ''Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis'' (the Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold), taught magic, including [[scrying]], [[Astral projection|astral travel]], and [[alchemy]]. The Third Order was that of the \"[[Secret Chiefs]]\", who were said to be highly skilled; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order.\n\n==History==\n\n===Cipher Manuscripts===\n{{Main|Cipher Manuscripts}}\n[[File:Folio 13.png|thumb|right|Folio 13 of the [[Cipher Manuscripts]]]]\n\nThe foundational documents of the original Order of the Golden Dawn, known as the [[Cipher Manuscripts]], are written in English using the [[Trithemius cipher]].  The manuscripts give the specific outlines of the Grade Rituals of the Order and prescribe a curriculum of graduated teachings that encompass the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], [[astrology]], [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|occult tarot]], [[geomancy]], and [[alchemy]].\n\nAccording to the records of the Order, the manuscripts passed from [[Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie]], a Masonic scholar, to the Rev. [[A. F. A. Woodford]], whom British occult writer [[Francis X. King|Francis King]] describes as the fourth founder<ref name=\"ref\">\nKing, 1989, page 42-43</ref> (although Woodford died shortly after the Order was founded).<ref name=\"yoga\">King, 1989, page 47</ref>  The documents did not excite Woodford, and in February 1886 he passed them on to Freemason [[William Wynn Westcott]], who managed to decode them in 1887.<ref name=\"ref\"/> Westcott, pleased with his discovery, called on fellow Freemason [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]]  for a second opinion. Westcott asked for Mathers' help to turn the manuscripts into a coherent system for lodge work. Mathers in turn asked fellow Freemason [[William Robert Woodman]] to assist the two, and he accepted.<ref name=\"ref\"/> Mathers and Westcott have been credited with developing the ritual outlines in the Cipher Manuscripts into a workable format.<ref>\nGolden Dawn researcher R. A. Gilbert has found evidence which suggests that Westcott was instrumental in developing the Order's rituals from the Cipher Manuscripts. See Gilbert's article, ''From Cipher to Enigma: The Role of William Wynn Westcott in the Creation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn'', from Carroll Runyon's book ''Secrets of the Golden Dawn Cypher Manuscripts.''\n</ref> Mathers, however, is generally credited with the design of the curriculum and rituals of the Second Order, which he called the ''Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis'' (\"Ruby Rose and Golden Cross\" or the ''RR et AC'').<ref>Regardie, 1993, page 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers in Egyptian getup.jpg|thumbnail|Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers in Egyptian setup performing a ritual in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]\n\n===Founding of first temple===\nIn October 1887, Westcott claimed to have written to a German countess and prominent Rosicrucian named [[Anna Sprengel]], whose address was said to have been found in the decoded Cipher Manuscripts. According to Westcott, Sprengel claimed the ability to contact certain supernatural entities, known as the [[Secret Chiefs]], that were considered the authorities over any magical order or esoteric organization. Westcott purportedly received a reply from Sprengel granting permission to establish a Golden Dawn temple and conferring honorary grades of [[Adept|Adeptus Exemptus]] on Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman.  The temple was to consist of the five grades outlined in the manuscripts.<ref name=\"king\">King, 1989, page 43</ref><ref name=\"regard\">Regardie, 1993, page 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1888, the [[Isis-Urania Temple]] was founded in [[London]].<ref name=\"king\"/>  In contrast to the S.R.I.A. and Masonry,<ref name=\"regard\"/> women were allowed and welcome to participate in the Order in \"perfect equality\" with men. The Order was more of a philosophical and metaphysical teaching order in its early years.  Other than certain rituals and meditations found in the Cipher manuscripts and developed further,<ref>King, 1997, page 35</ref> \"magical practices\" were generally not taught at the first temple.\n\nFor the first four years, the Golden Dawn was one cohesive group later known as \"the Outer Order\" or \"First Order.\" An \"Inner Order\" was established and became active in 1892.  The Inner Order consisted of members known as \"adepts,\" who had completed the entire course of study for the Outer Order. This group of adepts eventually became known as the Second Order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nEventually, the Osiris temple in [[Weston-super-Mare]], the Horus temple in [[Bradford]] (both in 1888), and the Amen-Ra temple in [[Edinburgh]] (1893) were founded. In 1893 Mathers founded the Ahathoor temple in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\n===Secret Chiefs===\n{{Main|Secret Chiefs}}\nIn 1891, Westcott's alleged correspondence with Anna Sprengel suddenly ceased.  He claimed to have received word from Germany that she was either dead or that her companions did not approve of the founding of the Order and no further contact was to be made. If the founders were to contact the [[Secret Chiefs]], apparently, it had to be done on their own.<ref name=\"king\" /> In 1892, Mathers professed that a link to the Secret Chiefs had been established.  Subsequently, he supplied rituals for the Second Order, calling them the Red Rose and Cross of Gold.<ref name=\"king\"/> The rituals were based on the tradition of the tomb of [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], and a ''Vault of Adepts'' became the controlling force behind the Outer Order.<ref>King, 1989, page 44</ref> Later in 1916, Westcott claimed that Mathers also constructed these rituals from materials he received from Frater Lux ex Tenebris, a purported ''Continental Adept''.<ref>King, 1989, page 46</ref>\n\nSome followers{{Who|date=August 2009}} of the Golden Dawn tradition believe that the Secret Chiefs were not human or supernatural beings but, rather, symbolic representations of actual or legendary sources of spiritual esotericism.  The term came to stand for a great leader or teacher of a spiritual path or practice that found its way into the teachings of the Order.<ref>Penczak, Christopher. ''Spirit Allies'', p. 27.  Red Wheel/Weiser Books. {{ISBN|1-57863-214-5}}</ref>\n\n===Golden Age===\n{{Golden Dawn}}\nBy the mid-1890s, the Golden Dawn was well established in Great Britain, with over one hundred members from every class of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society.<ref name=\"yoga\"/> Many celebrities belonged to the Golden Dawn, such as the actress [[Florence Farr]], the Irish revolutionary [[Maud Gonne]], the Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]], the Welsh author [[Arthur Machen]], and the English authors [[Evelyn Underhill]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].\n\nIn 1896 or 1897, Westcott broke all ties to the Golden Dawn, leaving Mathers in control. It has been speculated that his departure was due to his having lost a number of occult-related papers in a [[hansom cab]].  Apparently, when the papers were found, Westcott's connection to the Golden Dawn was discovered and brought to the attention of his employers. He may have been told to either resign from the Order or to give up his occupation as [[coroner]].<ref>King, 1989, page 48</ref> After Westcott's departure, Mathers appointed Florence Farr to be Chief Adept in Anglia.  Dr. [[Henry B. Pullen Burry]] succeeded Westcott as Cancellarius\u2014one of the three Chiefs of the Order.\n\nMathers was the only active founding member after Westcott's departure. Due to personality clashes with other members and frequent absences from the center of Lodge activity in Great Britain, however, challenges to Mathers's authority as leader developed among the members of the Second Order.<ref>{{cite book| last = [[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]] | editor = Liam Miller| title = Yeats, the Tarot and the Golden Dawn| edition = second| series = New Yeats Papers| volume = II| origyear = 1972| year = 1976| publisher = Dolmen Press| location = Dublin| page = 6}}</ref>\n\n===Revolt===\nToward the end of 1899, the Adepts of the Isis-Urania and Amen-Ra temples had become dissatisfied with Mathers' leadership, as well as his growing friendship with Aleister Crowley. They had also become anxious to make contact with the Secret Chiefs themselves, instead of relying on Mathers as an intermediary.<ref name=\"meatloaf\">King, 1989, page 66</ref> Within the Isis-Urania temple, disputes were arising between Farr's ''The Sphere'', a secret society within the Isis-Urania, and the rest of the Adepti Minores.<ref name=\"meatloaf\"/>\n\nCrowley was refused initiation into the Adeptus Minor grade by the London officials. Mathers overrode their decision and quickly initiated him at the Ahathoor temple in Paris on January 16, 1900.<ref name=\"farr\">King, 1989, page 67</ref> Upon his return to the London temple, Crowley requested from Miss Cracknell, the acting secretary, the papers acknowledging his grade, to which he was now entitled. To the London Adepts, this was the final straw. Farr, already of the opinion that the London temple should be closed, wrote to Mathers expressing her wish to resign as his representative, although she was willing to carry on until a successor was found.<ref name=\"farr\"/> Mathers believed  Westcott was behind this turn of events and replied on February 16. On March 3, a committee of seven Adepts was elected in London, and requested a full investigation of the matter. Mathers sent an immediate reply, declining to provide proof, refusing to acknowledge the London temple, and dismissing Farr as his representative on March 23.<ref>King, 1989, page 68-69</ref> In response, a general meeting was called on March 29 in London to remove Mathers as chief and expel him from the Order.<ref>King, 1989, page 69</ref>\n\n====Splinters====\nIn 1901, W. B. Yeats privately published a pamphlet titled ''Is the Order of R. R. & A. C. to Remain a Magical Order?''<ref>Melton, J. Gordon, editor, ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', v. 2 p. 1327, Gale Group, 2001 {{ISBN|0-8103-9489-8}}</ref>\nAfter the Isis-Urania temple claimed its independence, there were even more disputes, leading to Yeats resigning.<ref>King, 1989, page 78</ref> A committee of three was to temporarily govern, which included P.W. Bullock, M.W. Blackden and [[J. W. Brodie-Innes]]. After a short time, Bullock resigned, and Dr. [[Robert Felkin]] took his place.<ref>King, 1989, page 94</ref>\n\nIn 1903, [[Arthur Edward Waite|A. E. Waite]] and Blackden joined forces to retain the name Isis-Urania, while Felkin and other London members formed the [[Stella Matutina]].  Yeats remained in the Stella Matutina until 1921, while Brodie-Innes continued his Amen-Ra membership in Edinburgh.<ref>King, 1989, pages 95-96</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nOnce Mathers realised that reconciliation was impossible, he made efforts to reestablish himself in London. The Bradford and Weston-super-Mare temples remained loyal to him, but their numbers were few.<ref>King, 1989, page 109</ref> He then appointed [[Edmund William Berridge|Edward Berridge]] as his representative.<ref name=\"coffee\">King, 1989, page 110</ref> According to Francis King, historical evidence shows that there were \"twenty three members of a flourishing Second Order under Berridge-Mathers in 1913.\"<ref name=\"coffee\"/>\n\nJ.W. Brodie-Innes continued leading the Amen-Ra temple, deciding that the revolt was unjustified. By 1908, Mathers and Brodie-Innes were in complete accord.<ref name=\"serpent\">Regardie, 1993, page 33</ref> According to sources that differ regarding the actual date, sometime between 1901 and 1913 Mathers renamed the branch of the Golden Dawn remaining loyal to his leadership to [[Alpha et Omega]].<ref>King, 1971, p. 110-111</ref><ref name=\"donouts\">King, 1989, page 111</ref><ref name=\"freemason-bio\">\"The Golden Dawn ceased to exist by that name after October, 1901, replaced by Mathers' Alpha et Omega and the London group\u2019s Order of the Morgan Rothe.

There is a collision between keys \"John Smith\" and \"Sandra Dee\".]]\nA '''hash function''' is any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that can be used to map [[data (computing)|data]] of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called '''hash values''', '''hash codes''', '''digests''', or simply '''hashes'''. Hash functions are often used in combination with a [[hash table]], a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file. One such application is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences. They are also useful in [[cryptography]]. A [[cryptographic hash function]] allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or any equivalent alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This is used for assuring [[Data integrity|integrity]] of transmitted data, and is the building block for [[hash-based message authentication code|HMACs]], which provide [[message authentication]].\n\nHash functions are related to (and often confused with) [[checksums]], [[check digit]]s, [[Fingerprint (computing)|fingerprints]], [[lossy compression]], [[randomization function]]s, [[Error correction code|error-correcting codes]], and [[cipher]]s. Although the concepts overlap to some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed and optimized differently. The [[HashKeeper]] database maintained by the American National Drug Intelligence Center, for instance, is more aptly described as a catalogue of file fingerprints than of hash values.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Hash tables ===\nHash functions are used in [[hash table]]s,<ref name=\"hashing_in_computer_science\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU6fpT1sXCoC&lpg=PT12&pg=PT174 |title=Hashing in Computer Science: Fifty Years of Slicing and Dicing|first=Alan|last=Konheim|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=9780470344736|chapter=7. HASHING FOR STORAGE: DATA MANAGEMENT}}</ref> to quickly locate a data record (e.g.,&nbsp;a [[dictionary]] definition) given its [[primary key|search key]] (the [[headword]]). Specifically, the hash function is used to map the search key to a list; the index gives the place in the hash table where the corresponding record should be stored. Hash tables are also used to implement [[associative array]]s and [[set (abstract data type)|dynamic sets]].<ref name=\"handbook_of_applied_cryptography\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Applied Cryptography|first1=Alfred J.|last1=Menezes|first2=Paul C.|last2=van Oorschot|first3=Scott A|last3=Vanstone|year=1996|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849385237}}</ref>\n\nTypically, the domain of a hash function (the set of possible keys) is larger than its range (the number of different table indices), and so it will map several different keys to the same index which could result in collisions. So then, each slot of a hash table is associated with (implicitly or explicitly) a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of records, rather than a single record. For this reason, each slot of a hash table is often called a ''bucket'', and hash values are also called ''bucket listing''{{Citation needed|reason=I hear a reduced hash value called a 'bucket index' fairly often, but I've always understood 'bucket listing' to mean something else. |date=July 2017}} or a ''bucket index''.\n\nThus, the hash function only hints at the record's location. Still, in a half-full table, a good hash function will typically narrow the search down to only one or two entries.\n\nPeople who write complete hash table implementations choose a specific hash function\u2014such as a [[Jenkins hash]] or [[Zobrist hashing]]\u2014and independently choose a hash-table collision resolution scheme\u2014such as\n[[coalesced hashing]],\n[[cuckoo hashing]], or\n[[hopscotch hashing]].\n\n=== Caches ===\nHash functions are also used to build [[cache (computing)|caches]] for large data sets stored in slow media. A cache is generally simpler than a hashed search table, since any collision can be resolved by discarding or writing back the older of the two colliding items. This is also used in file comparison.\n\n=== Bloom filters ===\n{{Main|Bloom filter}}\nHash functions are an essential ingredient of the [[Bloom filter]], a space-efficient [[Probability|probabilistic]] [[data structure]] that is used to test whether an [[element (mathematics)|element]] is a member of a [[set (computer science)|set]].\n\n=== Finding duplicate records ===\n{{Main|Hash table}}\nWhen storing records in a large unsorted file, one may use a hash function to map each record to an index into a table ''T'', and to collect in each bucket ''T''[''i''] a [[list (computing)|list]] of the numbers of all records with the same hash value ''i''.  Once the table is complete, any two duplicate records will end up in the same bucket. The duplicates can then be found by scanning every bucket ''T''[''i''] which contains two or more members, fetching those records, and comparing them. With a table of appropriate size, this method is likely to be much faster than any alternative approach (such as sorting the file and comparing all consecutive pairs).\n\n=== Protecting data ===\n{{Main|Security of cryptographic hash functions}}\nA hash value can be used to uniquely identify secret information. This requires that the hash function is [[collision-resistant]], which means that it is very hard to find data that will generate the same hash value. These functions are categorized into cryptographic hash functions and provably<!-- don't try to correct this, \"pro*v*ably\" is correct --> secure hash functions. Functions in the second category are the most secure but also too slow for most practical purposes. Collision resistance is accomplished in part by generating very large hash values. For example, [[SHA-2]], one of the most widely used cryptographic hash functions, generates 256-bit values.\n\n=== Finding similar records ===\n{{Main|Locality sensitive hashing}}\nHash functions can also be used to locate table records whose key is similar, but not identical, to a given key; or pairs of records in a large file which have similar keys. For that purpose, one needs a hash function that maps similar keys to hash values that differ by at most ''m'', where ''m'' is a small integer (say, 1 or 2). If one builds a table ''T'' of all record numbers, using such a hash function, then similar records will end up in the same bucket, or in nearby buckets. Then one need only check the records in each bucket ''T''[''i''] against those in buckets ''T''[''i''+''k''] where ''k'' ranges between \u2212''m'' and&nbsp;''m''.\n\nThis class includes the so-called [[acoustic fingerprint]] algorithms, that are used to locate similar-sounding entries in large collection of [[audio file]]s. For this application, the hash function must be as insensitive as possible to data capture or transmission errors, and to trivial changes such as timing and volume changes, compression, etc.<ref name=\"AudioHash1\">[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rd/11787382%2C504088%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/25861/http:zSzzSzwww.extra.research.philips.comzSznatlabzSzdownloadzSzaudiofpzSzcbmi01audiohashv1.0.pdf/haitsma01robust.pdf \"Robust Audio Hashing for Content Identification by Jaap Haitsma, Ton Kalker and Job Oostveen\"]</ref>\n\n=== Finding similar substrings ===\nThe same techniques can be used to find equal or similar stretches in a large collection of strings, such as a document repository or a [[biological database|genomic database]]. In this case, the input strings are broken into many small pieces, and a hash function is used to detect potentially equal pieces, as above.\n\nThe [[Rabin\u2013Karp string search algorithm|Rabin\u2013Karp algorithm]] is a relatively fast [[string searching algorithm]] that works in [[big O notation|O(''n'')]] time on average. It is based on the use of hashing to compare strings.\n\n=== Geometric hashing ===\nThis principle is widely used in [[computer graphics]], [[computational geometry]] and many other disciplines, to solve many [[proximity problem]]s in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] or in [[three-dimensional space]], such as finding [[closest pair problem|closest pairs]] in a set of points, similar shapes in a list of shapes, similar [[image processing|images]] in an [[image retrieval|image database]], and so on. In these applications, the set of all inputs is some sort of [[metric space]], and the hashing function can be interpreted as a [[partition (mathematics)|partition]] of that space into a grid of ''cells''. The table is often an array with two or more indices (called a ''[[grid file]]'', ''grid index'', ''bucket grid'', and similar names), and the hash function returns an index [[tuple]]. This special case of hashing  is known as  [[geometric hashing]] or ''the grid method''. Geometric hashing is also used in [[telecommunication]]s (usually under the name [[vector quantization]]) to [[code (communications)|encode]] and [[data compression|compress]] [[Multidimensional signal processing|multi-dimensional signals]].\n\n=== Standard uses of hashing in cryptography ===\n{{Main|Cryptographic hash function}}\nSome standard applications that employ hash functions include authentication, message integrity (using an [[HMAC]] (Hashed MAC)), message fingerprinting, data corruption detection, and digital signature efficiency.\n\n== Properties ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}\nGood hash functions, in the original sense of the term, are usually required to satisfy certain properties listed below.  The exact requirements are dependent on the application. For example, a hash function well suited to indexing data will probably be a poor choice for a [[cryptographic hash function]].\n\n=== Determinism ===\nA hash procedure must be [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]]\u2014meaning that for a given input value it must always generate the same hash value. In other words, it must be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the data to be hashed, in the mathematical sense of the term. This requirement excludes hash functions that depend on external variable parameters, such as [[pseudo-random number generator]]s or the time of day. It also excludes functions that depend on the memory address of the object being hashed in cases that the address may change during execution (as may happen on systems that use certain methods of [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]), although sometimes rehashing of the item is possible.\n\nThe determinism is in the context of the reuse of the function. For example, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] adds the feature that hash functions make use of a randomized seed that is generated once when the Python process starts in addition to the input to be hashed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__|title=3. Data model \u2014 Python 3.6.1 documentation|website=docs.python.org|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref> The Python hash is still a valid hash function when used within a single run. But if the values are persisted (for example, written to disk) they can no longer be treated as valid hash values, since in the next run the random value might differ.\n\n=== Uniformity ===\nA good hash function  should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range.  That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same [[probability]]. The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of ''collisions''\u2014pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value\u2014increases.  If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries.\n\nNote that this criterion only requires the value to be ''uniformly distributed'', not ''random'' in any sense. A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function, but the converse need not be true.\n\nHash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs. For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names. In these cases, the uniformity criterion should hold for almost all typical subsets of entries that may be found in the table, not just for the global set of all possible entries.\n\nIn other words, if a typical set of ''m'' records is hashed to ''n'' table slots, the probability of a bucket receiving many more than ''m''/''n'' records should be vanishingly small. In particular, if ''m'' is less than ''n'', very few buckets should have more than one or two records. (In an ideal \"[[perfect hash function]]\", no bucket should have more than one record; but a small number of collisions is virtually inevitable, even if ''n'' is much larger than ''m'' \u2013 see the [[birthday problem]]).\n\nWhen testing a hash function, the uniformity of the distribution of hash values can be evaluated by the [[chi-squared test]].\n\n=== Defined range ===\nIt is often desirable that the output of a hash function have fixed size (but see below). If, for example, the output is constrained to 32-bit integer values, the hash values can be used to index into an array. Such hashing is commonly used to accelerate data searches.<ref name=\"algorithms_in_java\">{{cite book|title=Algorithms in Java|first=Robert|last=Sedgewick|year=2002|publisher=Addison Wesley|edition=3|isbn=978-0201361209|chapter=14. Hashing}}</ref> On the other hand, cryptographic hash functions produce much larger hash values, in order to ensure the computational complexity of brute-force inversion.<ref name=\"handbook_of_applied_cryptography\"/> For example, [[SHA-1]], one of the most widely used cryptographic hash functions, produces a 160-bit value.\n\nProducing fixed-length output from variable length input can be accomplished by breaking the input data into chunks of specific size. Hash functions used for data searches use some arithmetic expression which iteratively processes chunks of the input (such as the characters in a string) to produce the hash value.<ref name=\"algorithms_in_java\"/> In cryptographic hash functions, these chunks are processed by a [[one-way compression function]], with the last chunk being padded if necessary. In this case, their size, which is called ''block size'', is much bigger than the size of the hash value.<ref name=\"handbook_of_applied_cryptography\"/> For example, in [[SHA-1]], the hash value is 160 bits and the block size 512 bits.\n\n==== Variable range ====\nIn many applications, the range of hash values may be different for each run of the program, or may change along the same run (for instance, when a hash table needs to be expanded). In those situations, one needs a hash function which takes two parameters\u2014the input data ''z'', and the number ''n'' of allowed hash values.\n\nA common solution is to compute a fixed hash function with a very large range (say, 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), divide the result by ''n'', and use the division's [[modulo operation|remainder]]. If ''n'' is itself a power of 2, this can be done by [[Mask (computing)|bit masking]] and [[bit shifting]]. When this approach is used, the hash function must be chosen so that the result has fairly uniform distribution between 0 and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, for any value of ''n'' that may occur in the application. Depending on the function, the remainder may be uniform only for certain values of ''n'', e.g. [[odd number|odd]] or [[prime number]]s.\n\nWe can allow the table size ''n'' to not be a power of 2 and still not have to perform any remainder or division operation, as these computations are sometimes costly. For example, let ''n'' be significantly less than 2<sup>''b''</sup>. Consider a [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG) function ''P''(key) that is uniform on the interval [0, 2<sup>''b''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1]. A hash function uniform on the interval [0, n-1] is ''n'' ''P''(key)/2<sup>''b''</sup>. We can replace the division by a (possibly faster) right [[bit shifting|bit shift]]: ''nP''(key) >> ''b''.\n\n==== Variable range with minimal movement (dynamic hash function) ====\nWhen the hash function is used to store values in a hash table that outlives the run of the program, and the hash table needs to be expanded or shrunk, the hash table is referred to as a dynamic hash table.\n\nA hash function that will relocate the minimum number of records when the table is \u2013 where ''z'' is the key being hashed and ''n'' is the number of allowed hash values&nbsp;\u2013 such that ''H''(''z'',''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) = ''H''(''z'',''n'') with probability close to ''n''/(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1).\n\n[[Linear hashing]] and spiral storage are examples of dynamic hash functions that execute in constant time but relax the property of uniformity to achieve the minimal movement property.\n\n[[Extendible hashing]] uses a dynamic hash function that requires space proportional to ''n'' to compute the hash function, and it becomes a function of the previous keys that have been inserted.\n\nSeveral algorithms that preserve the uniformity property but require time proportional to ''n'' to compute the value of ''H''(''z'',''n'') have been invented.\n\nA hash function with minimal movement is especially useful in [[distributed hash table]]s.\n\n=== Data normalization ===\nIn some applications, the input data may contain features that are irrelevant for comparison purposes. For example, when looking up a personal name, it may be desirable to ignore the distinction between upper and lower case letters. For such data, one must use a hash function that is compatible with the data [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] criterion being used: that is, any two inputs that are considered equivalent must yield the same hash value. This can be accomplished by normalizing the input before hashing it, as by upper-casing all letters.\n\n=== Continuity ===\n\"A hash function that is used to search for similar (as opposed to equivalent) data must be as [[continuous function|continuous]] as possible; two inputs that differ by a little should be mapped to equal or nearly equal hash values.\"<ref name=\"Josiang\">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/199819816/Fundamental-Data-Structures \"Fundamental Data Structures \u2013 Josiang p.132\"]. Retrieved May 19, 2014.</ref>\n\nNote that continuity is usually considered a fatal flaw for checksums, [[cryptographic hash function]]s, and other related concepts. Continuity is desirable for hash functions only in some applications, such as hash tables used in [[Nearest neighbor search]].\n\n=== Non-invertible ===\nIn cryptographic applications, hash functions are typically expected to be practically [[Inverse function|non-invertible]], meaning that it is not realistic to reconstruct the input datum {{mvar|x}} from its hash value {{mvar|h}}({{mvar|x}}) alone without spending great amounts of computing time (see also [[One-way function]]).\n\n== Hash function algorithms ==\nFor most types of hashing functions, the choice of the function depends strongly on the nature of the input data, and their [[probability distribution]] in the intended application.\n\n=== Trivial hash function ===\nIf the data to be hashed is small enough, one can use the data itself (reinterpreted as an integer) as the hashed value. The cost of computing this \"trivial\" ([[identity function|identity]]) hash function is effectively zero. This hash function is [[Perfect hash function|perfect]], as it maps each input to a distinct hash value.\n\nThe meaning of \"small enough\" depends on the size of the type that is used as the hashed value. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the hash code is a 32-bit integer. Thus the 32-bit integer <code>Integer</code> and 32-bit floating-point <code>Float</code> objects can simply use the value directly; whereas the 64-bit integer <code>Long</code> and 64-bit floating-point <code>Double</code> cannot use this method.\n\nOther types of data can also use this perfect hashing scheme. For example, when mapping [[character string]]s between [[letter case|upper and lower case]], one can use the binary encoding of each character, interpreted as an integer, to index a table that gives the alternative form of that character (\"A\" for \"a\", \"8\" for \"8\", etc.).  If each character is stored in 8 bits (as in extended [[ASCII]]<ref>Plain ASCII is a 7-bit character encoding, although it is often stored in 8-bit bytes with the highest-order bit always clear (zero).  Therefore, for plain ASCII, the bytes have only 2<sup>7</sup> = 128 valid values, and the character translation table has only this many entries.</ref> or [[ISO Latin 1]]), the table has only 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 entries; in the case of [[Unicode]] characters, the table would have 17\u00d72<sup>16</sup> = {{val|1114112}} entries.\n\nThe same technique can be used to map [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|two-letter country codes]] like \"us\" or \"za\" to country names (26<sup>2</sup> = 676 table entries), 5-digit zip codes like 13083 to city names ({{val|100000}} entries), etc. Invalid data values (such as the country code \"xx\" or the zip code 00000) may be left undefined in the table or mapped to some appropriate \"null\" value.\n\n=== Perfect hashing ===\n{{Main|Perfect hash function}}\n[[File:Hash table 4 1 1 0 0 0 0 LL.svg|thumb|240px|right|A perfect hash function for the four names shown]]\nA hash function that is [[injective function|injective]]\u2014that is, maps each valid input to a different hash value\u2014is said to be '''[[perfect hash function|perfect]]'''. With such a function one can directly locate the desired entry in a hash table, without any additional searching.\n\n=== Minimal perfect hashing ===\n[[File:Hash table 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 LL.svg|thumb|240px|right|A minimal perfect hash function for the four names shown]]\nA perfect hash function for ''n'' keys is said to be '''minimal''' if its range consists of ''n'' ''consecutive'' integers, usually from 0 to ''n''\u22121. Besides providing single-step lookup, a minimal perfect hash function also yields a compact hash table, without any vacant slots. Minimal perfect hash functions are much harder to find than perfect ones with a wider range.\n\n=== Hashing uniformly distributed data ===\nIf the inputs are bounded-length [[string (computer science)|strings]] and each input may [[statistical independence|independently]] occur with [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] probability (such as [[telephone number]]s, [[vehicle registration plate|car license plates]], [[invoice]] numbers, etc.), then a hash function needs to map roughly the same number of inputs to each hash value. For instance, suppose that each input is an integer ''z'' in the range 0 to ''N''\u22121, and the output must be an integer ''h'' in the range 0 to ''n''\u22121, where ''N'' is much larger than ''n''. Then the hash function could be  ''h'' = ''z'' '''mod''' ''n'' (the remainder of ''z'' divided by ''n''), or ''h'' = (''z'' \u00d7 ''n'') \u00f7 ''N'' (the value ''z'' scaled down by ''n''/''N'' and truncated to an integer), or many other formulas.\n\n=== Hashing data with other distributions ===\nThese simple formulas will not do if the input values are not equally likely, or are not independent. For instance, most patrons of a [[supermarket]] will live in the same geographic area, so their telephone numbers are likely to begin with the same 3 to 4 digits. In that case, if ''m'' is 10000 or so, the division formula (''z'' \u00d7 ''m'') \u00f7 ''M'', which depends mainly on the leading digits, will generate a lot of collisions; whereas the remainder formula ''z'' '''mod''' ''m'', which is quite sensitive to the trailing digits, may still yield a fairly even distribution.\n\n=== Hashing variable-length data ===\nWhen the data values are long (or variable-length) [[character string]]s\u2014such as personal names, [[URL|web page addresses]], or mail messages\u2014their distribution is usually very uneven, with complicated dependencies. For example, text in any [[natural language]] has highly non-uniform distributions of [[character (computing)|characters]], and [[digraph (computing)|character pairs]], very characteristic of the language. For such data, it is prudent to use a hash function that depends on all characters of the string\u2014and depends on each character in a different way.\n\nIn cryptographic hash functions, a [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] is usually used. In general, the scheme for hashing such data is to break the input into a sequence of small units ([[bit]]s, [[byte]]s, [[Word (data type)|words]], etc.) and combine all the units ''b''[1], ''b''[2], \u2026, ''b''[''m''] sequentially, as follows\n\n S \u2190 S0;                         // ''Initialize the state.''\n '''for''' k '''in''' 1, 2, ..., m '''do'''        // ''Scan the input data units:''\n   S \u2190 F(S, b[k]);               // ''Combine data unit k into the state.''\n '''return''' G(S, n)                  // ''Extract the hash value from the state.''\n\nThis schema is also used in many text checksum and fingerprint algorithms. The state variable ''S'' may be a 32- or 64-bit unsigned integer; in that case, ''S0'' can be 0, and ''G''(''S'',''n'') can be just ''S'' '''mod''' ''n''. The best choice of ''F'' is a complex issue and depends on the nature of the data. If the units ''b''[''k''] are single bits, then ''F''(''S'',''b'') could be, for instance\n\n  '''if''' highbit(S) = 0 '''then'''\n    '''return''' 2 * S + b\n  '''else'''\n    '''return''' (2 * S + b) ^ P\n\nHere ''highbit''(''S'') denotes the most significant bit of ''S''; the '<tt>*</tt>' operator denotes unsigned integer multiplication with lost [[overflow (software)|overflow]]; '<tt>^</tt>' is the bitwise [[exclusive or]] operation applied to words; and ''P'' is a suitable fixed word.<ref name=\"bro2\">{{cite book |first=A. Z. |last=Broder |chapter=Some applications of Rabin's fingerprinting method |title=Sequences II: Methods in Communications, Security, and Computer Science |pages=143\u2013152 |location= |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1993 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n=== Special-purpose hash functions ===\nIn many cases, one can design a special-purpose ([[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]]) hash function that yields many fewer collisions than a good general-purpose hash function. For example, suppose that the input data are file names such as <tt>FILE0000.CHK</tt>, <tt>FILE0001.CHK</tt>, <tt>FILE0002.CHK</tt>, etc., with mostly sequential numbers. For such data, a function that extracts the numeric part ''k'' of the file name and returns ''k'' '''mod''' ''n'' would be nearly optimal. Needless to say, a function that is exceptionally good for a specific kind of data may have dismal performance on data with different distribution.\n\n=== Rolling hash ===\n{{Main|Rolling hash}}\nIn some applications, such as [[string searching algorithm|substring search]], one must compute a hash function ''h'' for every ''k''-character [[substring]] of a given ''n''-character string ''t''; where  ''k'' is a fixed integer, and ''n'' is greater than ''k''. The straightforward solution, which is to extract every such substring ''s'' of ''t'' and compute ''h''(''s'') separately, requires a number of operations proportional to ''k''\u00b7''n''. However, with the proper choice of ''h'', one can use the technique of rolling hash to compute all those hashes with an effort proportional to ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''.\n\n=== Universal hashing ===\nA [[universal hashing]] scheme is a [[randomized algorithm]] that selects a hashing function ''h'' among a family of such functions, in such a way that the probability of a collision of any two distinct keys is 1/''n'', where ''n'' is the number of distinct hash values desired\u2014independently of the two keys. Universal hashing ensures (in a probabilistic sense) that the hash function application will behave as well as if it were using a random function, for any distribution of the input data. It will, however, have more collisions than perfect hashing and may require more operations than a special-purpose hash function. See also unique permutation hashing.<ref>Shlomi Dolev, Limor Lahiani, Yinnon Haviv, \"Unique permutation hashing\", Theoretical Computer Science Volume 475, 4 March 2013, Pages 59\u201365.</ref>\n\n=== Hashing with checksum functions ===\nOne can adapt certain checksum or fingerprinting algorithms for use as hash functions. Some of those algorithms will map arbitrarily long string data ''z'', with any typical real-world distribution\u2014no matter how non-uniform and dependent\u2014to a 32-bit or 64-bit string, from which one can extract a hash value in 0 through ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.\n\nThis method may produce a sufficiently uniform distribution of hash values, as long as the hash range size ''n'' is small compared to the range of the checksum or fingerprint function. However, some checksums fare poorly in the [[avalanche effect|avalanche test]], which may be a concern in some applications. In particular, the popular CRC32 checksum provides only 16 bits (the higher half of the result) that are usable for hashing.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}{{dubious|reason: Bret Mulvey's CRC-32 example code is incorrect|date=December 2013}} Moreover, each bit of the input has a deterministic effect on each bit of the CRC32 output; that is, one can tell without looking at the rest of the input which bits of the output will flip if the input bit is flipped, so care must be taken to use all 32 bits when computing the hash from the checksum.<ref>Bret Mulvey, ''[http://bretmulvey.com/hash/8.html Evaluation of CRC32 for Hash Tables]'', in ''[http://bretmulvey.com/hash/ Hash Functions]''.

Hashing\".\n</ref> Standard multiplicative hashing uses the formula <math>h_a(x)=\\lfloor(ax\\bmod W)/(W/M)\\rfloor</math> which produces a hash value in <math>\\{0,\\ldots,M-1\\}</math>.  The value <math>a</math> is an appropriately chosen value that should be relatively prime to <math>W</math>.  An important practical special case occurs when <math>W=2^w</math> and <math>M=2^m</math> are powers of 2 and <math>w</math> is the machine [[word size]]. In this case this formula becomes <math>h_a(x)=\\lfloor(ax\\bmod 2^w)/2^{w-m}\\rfloor</math>.  This is special because arithmetic modulo <math>2^w</math> is done by default in low-level programming languages and integer division by a power of 2 is simply a right-shift, so, in C, for example, this function becomes\n  unsigned hash(unsigned x) { \n     return (a*x) >> (w-m)\n  }\nand for fixed <math>m</math> and <math>w</math> this translates into a single integer multiplication and right-shift making it one of the fastest hash functions to compute.  Furthermore, if <math>a</math> is a uniformly random ''odd'' integer in <math>\\{1,\\ldots,2^{w}-1\\}</math> then this hash function is nearly universal in the sense that, for any <math>x\\neq y</math>, <math>\\Pr\\{h_a(x) = h_a(y)\\} \\le 2/m</math>.<ref>\nOpen Data Structures.\n[http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/5_1_Hashing_with_Chaining.html#SECTION00911000000000000000 \"Multiplicative Hashing\"]\n</ref>\n\nIn many applications, such as hash tables, collisions make the system a little slower but are otherwise harmless.\nIn such systems, it is often better to use hash functions based on multiplication\u2014such as [[MurmurHash]] and the SBoxHash\u2014or even simpler hash functions such as [[CRC32]]\u2014and tolerate more collisions; rather than use a more complex hash function that avoids many of those collisions but takes longer to compute. Multiplicative hashing is susceptible to a \"common mistake\" that leads to poor diffusion&mdash;higher-value input bits do not affect lower-value output bits.<ref>\n[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2008fa/lectures/lec21.html \"CS 3110 Lecture 21: Hash functions\"].\nSection \"Multiplicative hashing\".\n</ref>\n\n=== Hashing with cryptographic hash functions ===\nSome [[cryptographic hash function]]s, such as [[SHA-1]], have even stronger uniformity guarantees than checksums or fingerprints, and thus can provide very good general-purpose hashing functions.\n\nIn ordinary applications, this advantage may be too small to offset their much higher cost.<ref>Bret Mulvey, ''[http://bretmulvey.com/hash/9.html Evaluation of SHA-1 for Hash Tables]'', in ''[http://bretmulvey.com/hash/ Hash Functions]''. Accessed April 10, 2009.</ref>  However, this method can provide uniformly distributed hashes even when the keys are chosen by a malicious agent. This feature may help to protect services against [[denial of service attack]]s.\n\n=== Hashing by nonlinear table lookup ===\n{{main | Tabulation hashing}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\n\nTables of random numbers (such as 256 random 32-bit integers) can provide high-quality nonlinear functions to be used as hash functions or for other purposes such as cryptography. The key to be hashed is split into 8-bit (one-byte) parts, and each part is used as an index for the nonlinear table. The table values are then added by arithmetic or XOR addition to the hash output value. Because the table is just 1024 bytes in size, it fits into the cache of modern microprocessors and allows very fast execution of the hashing algorithm. As the table value is on average much longer than 8 bits, one bit of input affects nearly all output bits.\n\nThis algorithm has proven to be very fast and of high quality for hashing purposes (especially hashing of integer-number keys).\n\n=== Efficient hashing of strings ===\n{{See also|Universal hashing#Hashing strings}}\nModern microprocessors will allow for much faster processing, if 8-bit character strings are not hashed by processing one character at a time, but by interpreting the string as an array of 32 bit or 64 bit integers and hashing/accumulating these \"wide word\" integer values by means of arithmetic operations (e.g. multiplication by constant and bit-shifting). The remaining characters of the string which are smaller than the word length of the CPU must be handled differently (e.g. being processed one character at a time).\n\nThis approach has proven to speed up hash code generation by a factor of five or more on modern microprocessors of\na word size of 64 bit.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAnother approach<ref>http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.18.7520 Performance in Practice of String Hashing Functions</ref> is to convert strings to a 32 or 64 bit numeric value and then apply a hash function.  One method that avoids the problem of strings having great similarity (\"Aaaaaaaaaa\" and \"Aaaaaaaaab\") is to use a [[Cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) of the string to compute a 32- or 64-bit value. While it is possible that two different strings will have the same CRC, the likelihood is very small and only requires that one check the actual string found to determine whether one has an exact match. CRCs will be different for strings such as \"Aaaaaaaaaa\" and \"Aaaaaaaaab\". Although CRC codes can be used as hash values,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strchr.com/hash_functions|title=Hash functions: An empirical comparison|author=Peter Kankowski}}</ref> they are not cryptographically secure, because they are not [[collision-resistant]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35\u201339 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Locality-sensitive hashing ==\n[[Locality-sensitive hashing]] (LSH) is a method of performing probabilistic dimension reduction of high-dimensional data. The basic idea is to hash the input items so that similar items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability (the number of buckets being much smaller than the universe of possible input items). This is different from the conventional hash functions, such as those used in cryptography, as in this case the goal is to minimize the probability of \"collision\" of every item.<ref>{{cite web|author=A. Rajaraman and J. Ullman| url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html |title=Mining of Massive Datasets, Ch. 3. |year=2010}}</ref>\n\nOne example of LSH is [[MinHash]] algorithm used for finding similar documents (such as web-pages):\n\nLet ''h'' be a hash function that maps the members of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} to distinct integers, and for any set ''S'' define {{math|''h''<sub>min</sub>(''S'')}} to be the member {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''S''}} with the minimum value of {{math|''h''(''x'')}}. Then {{math|1=''h''<sub>min</sub>(''A'') = ''h''<sub>min</sub>(''B'')}} exactly when the minimum hash value of the union {{math|''A'' &cup; ''B''}} lies in the intersection {{math|''A'' &cap; ''B''}}.\nTherefore,\n:{{math|1=Pr[''h''<sub>min</sub>(''A'') = ''h''<sub>min</sub>(''B'')] = ''J''(''A'',''B'').}} where J is [[Jaccard index]].\nIn other words, if {{math|''r''}} is a random variable that is one when {{math|1=''h''<sub>min</sub>(''A'') = ''h''<sub>min</sub>(''B'')}} and zero otherwise, then {{math|''r''}} is an [[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimator]] of {{math|''J''(''A'',''B'')}}, although it has too high a [[variance]] to be useful on its own. The idea of the MinHash scheme is to reduce the variance by averaging together several variables constructed in the same way.\n\n== Origins of the term ==\nThe term \"hash\" offers a natural analogy with its non-technical meaning (to \"chop\" or \"make a mess\" out of something), given how hash functions scramble their input data to derive their output.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knuth|first1=Donald E.|title=Sorting and searching|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0-201-89685-0|page=514|edition=2. ed., 6. printing, newly updated and rev.}}</ref> In his research for the precise origin of the term, [[Donald Knuth]] notes that, while [[Hans Peter Luhn]] of [[IBM]] appears to have been the first to use the concept of a hash function in a memo dated January 1953, the term itself would only appear in published literature in the late 1960s, on Herbert Hellerman's ''Digital Computer System Principles'', even though it was already widespread jargon by then.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knuth|first1=Donald E.|title=Sorting and searching|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0-201-89685-0|pages=547\u2013548|edition=2. ed., 6. printing, newly updated and rev.}}</ref>\n\n== List of hash functions ==\n{{Main|List of hash functions}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=50em|\n*[[NIST hash function competition]]\n*[[MD5]]\n*Bernstein hash<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html |title=Hash Functions |work=cse.yorku.ca |date=September 22, 2003 |quote=the djb2 algorithm (k=33) was first reported by dan bernstein many years ago in comp.lang.c. |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function]] (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits)\n*[[Jenkins hash function]] (32 bits)\n*[[Pearson hashing]] (8 or more bits)\n*[[Zobrist hashing]]}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer science}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=33em|\n*[[Comparison of cryptographic hash functions]]\n*[[Distributed hash table]]\n*[[Salt (cryptography)]]\n*[[Identicon]]\n*[[Low-discrepancy sequence]]\n*[[PhotoDNA]]\n*[[Transposition table]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|hash}}\n*[http://tools.timodenk.com/?p=hash-function Calculate hash of a given value] by Timo Denk\n*[http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/index.html Hash Functions and Block Ciphers] by Bob Jenkins\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/drone115b/Goulburn06.pdf&date=2009-10-25+21:06:51  The Goulburn Hashing Function] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) by Mayur Patel\n* [http://herakles.zcu.cz/~skala/PUBL/PUBL_2010/2010_WSEAS-Corfu_Hash-final.pdf Hash Function Construction for Textual and Geometrical Data Retrieval] Latest Trends on Computers, Vol.2, pp.&nbsp;483\u2013489, CSCC conference, Corfu, 2010\n\n{{Cryptographic software}}\n\n[[Category:Error detection and correction]]\n[[Category:Hash functions| ]]\n[[Category:Search algorithms]]", "sha1": "47cct4mh8xllhsjvtg65orcwxynl4wp"}}, {"title": "High jump", "ns": "0", "id": "13791", "revision": {"id": "854792783", "parentid": "854421749", "timestamp": "2018-08-13T20:20:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Montell 74", "id": "10270558"}, "comment": "/* Men */ NR TUR added", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox athletics event\n|event= High jump\n|image= [[File:Yelena Slesarenko failing 2007.jpg|240px]]\n|caption= [[Yelena Slesarenko]] using the [[Fosbury Flop]] technique during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].\n|WRmen= [[Javier Sotomayor]] {{T&Fcalc|2.45}}  (1993)\n|ORmen= [[Charles Austin]] {{T&Fcalc|2.39}}  (1996)\n|WRwomen=  [[Stefka Kostadinova]] {{T&Fcalc|2.09}} (1987)\n|ORwomen=  [[Yelena Slesarenko]] {{T&Fcalc|2.06}}  (2004)\n}}\nThe '''high jump''' is a [[track and field]] event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it. In its modern most practised format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. In the modern era, athletes run towards the bar and use the [[Fosbury Flop]] method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar. Since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form.\n\nThe discipline is, alongside the [[pole vault]], one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]]. It is contested at the [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]].\n\n[[Javier Sotomayor]] (Cuba) is the current men's record holder with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|2.45}} set in 1993&nbsp;\u2013 the longest standing record in the history of the men's high jump. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] (Bulgaria) has held the women's world record at {{T&Fcalc|2.09}} since 1987, also the longest-held record in the event.\n[[File:Javier Sotomayor 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Javier Sotomayor]], the only human ever to have cleared 8 feet in high jump]]\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Nicole Forrester.JPG|thumb|Canadian high jumper [[Nicole Forrester]] demonstrating the Fosbury flop]]\n\nThe rules for the high jump are set internationally by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Jumpers must take off on one foot. A jump is considered a failure if the bar is dislodged by the action of the jumper whilst jumping or the jumper touches the ground or breaks the plane of the near edge of the bar before clearance. The technique one uses for the jump must be almost flawless in order to have a chance of clearing a high bar.\n\nCompetitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Most competitions state that three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.\n\nThe victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final. Tie-breakers are used for any place in which scoring occurs. If two or more jumpers tie for one of these places, the tie-breakers are: 1) the fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) the fewest misses throughout the competition.\n\nIf the event remains tied for first place (or a limited advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next greater height. Each jumper has one attempt. The bar is then alternately lowered and raised until only one jumper succeeds at a given height.<ref name=\"rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023632/http://iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} iaaf rules</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1912 Konstantinos Tsiklitiras2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Konstantinos Tsiklitiras]] during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nThe first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a [[Scissors jump|scissors]] technique. In latter years, soon then after, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to change, beginning with the Irish-American [[Michael Sweeney (athlete)|Michael Sweeney's]] ''[[Eastern cut-off]]''. By taking off like the scissors and extending his spine and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney raised the world record to {{T&Fcalc|1.97}} in 1895.\n\nAnother American, [[George Horine]], developed an even more efficient technique, the ''[[Western roll]]''. In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to {{T&Fcalc|2.01}} in 1912. His technique was predominant through the [[Berlin Olympics]] of 1936, in which the event was won by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] at {{T&Fcalc|2.03}}.\n\nAmerican and Soviet jumpers were the most successful for the next four decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the [[straddle technique]]. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most efficient and highest clearance (of the bar) up to that time. Straddle-jumper, [[Charles Dumas]], was the first to clear 7 feet (2.13&nbsp;m), in 1956, and American [[John Thomas (high jumper)|John Thomas]] pushed the world mark to {{T&Fcalc|2.23}} in 1960. [[Valeriy Brumel]] took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to {{T&Fcalc|2.28}}, and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career.\n[[File:EthelCatherwood1928.jpg|thumb|Gold medal winner [[Ethel Catherwood]] of Canada ''scissors'' over the bar at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. Her winning result was {{T&Fcalc|1.59}}.]]\n \n[[File:1912 Platt Adams5.JPG|thumb|left|Platt Adams during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]\nAmerican coaches, including two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] champion Frank Costello of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at [[Oregon State University]], [[Dick Fosbury]], who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this [[Fosbury flop]] to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon ''floppers'' were dominating international high jump competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was [[Vladimir Yashchenko]], who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.33}} in 1977 and then {{T&Fcalc|2.35}} indoors in 1978.\n\nAmong renowned high jumpers following Fosbury's lead were Americans [[Dwight Stones]] and his rival, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|order=flip}} tall [[Franklin Jacobs]] of Paterson, NJ, who cleared {{T&Fcalc|2.32}},  {{convert|0.59|m}} over his head (a feat equalled 27 years later by Sweden's [[Stefan Holm]]); Chinese record-setters [[Ni Zhiqin|Ni-chi Chin]] and [[Zhu Jianhua]]; Germans [[Gerd Wessig]] and [[Dietmar M\u00f6genburg]]; Swedish Olympic medalist and former world record holder [[Patrik Sj\u00f6berg]]; and female jumpers [[Iolanda Bala\u015f]] of Romania, [[Ulrike Meyfarth]] of Germany and Italy's [[Sara Simeoni]].\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===The approach run===\n[[File:Ruth Beitia Valence 2008.jpg|thumb|Spanish jumper [[Ruth Beitia]] approaching the bar from an angle]]\nThe approach run of the high jump may actually be more important than the take-off.  If a high jumper runs with bad timing or without enough aggression, clearing a high bar becomes more of a challenge.  The approach requires a certain shape or curve, the right amount of speed, and the correct number of strides.  The approach angle is also critical for optimal height.\n\nMost great straddle jumpers have a run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees.  The length of the run is determined by the speed of the person's approach.  A slower run requires about 8 strides.  However, a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides.  A greater run speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachr.org/hj.htm|title=The HIGH JUMP|first=|last=CoachR|date=|website=www.coachr.org}}</ref>\n\nThe '''J''' type approach, favored by Fosbury floppers, allows for horizontal speed, the ability to turn in the air ([[centripetal force]]), and good take-off position. This allows for horizontal momentum to turn into vertical momentum, propelling the jumper off the ground and over the bar.  The approach should be a hard controlled stride so that a person does not fall from creating an angle with speed.  Athletes should run tall and lean on the curve, from the ankles and not the hips. This allows the correct angle to force their hips to rotate during take-off, which allows their center of gravity to pass under the bar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123060941/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The take-off===\n\nUnlike the classic straddle technique, where the take-off foot is \"planted\" in the same spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their  approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.\n\nAn effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. \n \nDrills can be practiced to solidify the approach.  One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another.  Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123042035/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the '''J''' approach to carry the body across the bar.\n\n== Winner declaration ==\nIn competition the winner is the person who cleared the highest height. In case of a tie, fewer failed attempts at that height are better: ''i.e.'', the jumper who makes a height on his or her first attempt is placed ahead of someone who clears the same height on the second or third attempt. If there still is a tie, all the failed attempts at lower heights are added up, and the one with the fewest total misses is declared the winner. If still tied, a playoff is held.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/jumps/high-jump \"How it works\".] iaaf.org. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Starting height is the next higher height after the overjumped one. If all the competitors clear the height, the bar is raised {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}, and if they fail, the bar is lowered 2&nbsp;cm. That continues until only one competitor succeeds in overjumping that height, and he or she is declared the winner.\n\n* In the table below, dashes indicate that a height was not attempted, crosses indicate failed attempts, and circles indicate a cleared height.

Similarly, '''B''' is ranked ahead of '''C''', having cleared the decisive height (i.e., 1.97m) in the first attempt.\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\"\n!style=\"align:center\"|Athlete||1.91&nbsp;m||1.93&nbsp;m||1.95&nbsp;m||1.97&nbsp;m||1.99&nbsp;m||2.01&nbsp;m||Height||Rank\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|A\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|B\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|3rd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|C\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|X--\n|align=\"center\"|XX\n|align=\"center\"|1.97\n|align=\"center\"|4th\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|D\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XO\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXO\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"|1.99\n|align=\"center\"|2nd\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|E\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|O\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|XXX\n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"| \n|align=\"center\"|1.93\n|align=\"center\"|5th\n|-\n|}\n\n== Training ==\nIn high jump, it helps if the athlete is tall, has long legs, and limited weight on their body. They must have a strong lower body and flexibility helps a lot as well. High jumpers tend to go through very vigorous training methods to achieve this ideal body frame.\n\n=== Sprinting ===\nHigh jumpers must have a fast approach so it is crucial to work on speed and also speed endurance. Lots of high jump competitions may take hours and athletes must make sure they have the endurance to last the entire competition. Common sprint endurance workouts for high jumpers include 200-, 400-, and 800-meter training. Other speed endurance training methods such as hill training or a ladder workout may also be used.\n\n=== Weight Lifting ===\nIt is crucial for high jumpers to have strong lower bodies and cores, as the bar progressively gets higher, the strength of an athlete's legs (along with speed and technique) will help propel them over the bar. [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]s, [[deadlifts]], and core exercises will help a high jumper achieve these goals. It is important, however, for a high jumper to keep a slim figure as any unnecessary weight makes it difficult to jump higher.\n\n=== Plyometrics ===\nArguably the most important training for a high jumper is [[plyometric]] training. Because high jump is such a technical event, any mistake in the technique could either lead to failure, injury, or both. To prevent these from happening, high jumpers tend to focus heavily on plyometrics. This includes hurdle jumps, flexibility training, skips, or [[scissors kick (strike)|scissor kick]] training. Plyometric workouts tend to be performed at the beginning of the workout.<ref>http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&catalogId=10753&pagename=307</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kangarootrackclub.org/high-jump-drills.html|title=High Jump Drills|first=|last=KangarooTrackClub.org|date=|website=www.kangarootrackclub.org}}</ref>\n\n==All-time top 25 athletes==\n{{see also|Men's high jump world record progression|Women's high jump world record progression|Men's high jump indoor world record progression}}\n*{{As of|July 2018}}.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/high-jump/outdoor/men/senior High Jump - men - senior - outdoor].

See ''Cratylus'', 402a.</ref> (see ''[[#Panta rhei, \"everything flows\"|panta rhei]]'' below). This is commonly considered to be one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and has been contrasted with [[Parmenides]] statement that \"what-is is\" as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of [[being]]. As such, Parmenides and Heraclitus are commonly considered to be two of the founders of [[ontology]]. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom changed over the course of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Palmer\">{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides|title=Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=John Palmer}}</ref> Heraclitus' position was complemented by his stark commitment to a [[unity of opposites]] in the world, stating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that \"all entities come to be in accordance with this ''[[Logos]]''\" (literally, \"word\", \"reason\", or \"account\") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Efez agora odeon prytaneion RB.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ephesus on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], birthplace of Heraclitus]]\nThe main source for the life of Heraclitus is [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], although some have questioned the validity of his account as \"a tissue of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] anecdotes, most of them obviously fabricated on the basis of statements in the preserved fragments\".<ref name=\"kahn\">{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles |title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus: Fragments with Translation and Commentary |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |pages=1\u201323 |isbn=978-0-521-28645-9}}</ref> Diogenes said that Heraclitus [[floruit|flourished]] in the 69th [[Olympiad]],<ref name=\"ix1\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 1</ref> 504\u2013501 BCE.

His dates of birth and death are based on a life span of 60 years, the age at which Diogenes says he died,<ref name=\"ix3\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 3</ref> with the floruit in the middle.\n\nHeraclitus was born to an aristocratic family in [[Ephesus]], in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in what is now called present-day [[Efes, Turkey]].{{sfn|Naddaf|2005|page=126}}{{sfn|Wieseh\u00f6fer|2003|pages=201\u2013202}} His father was named either Blos\u00f4n or Herak\u00f4n.<ref name=\"ix1\"/> Diogenes says that he [[abdication|abdicated]] the kingship (''basileia'') in favor of his brother<ref name=\"ix6\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 6</ref> and [[Strabo]] confirms that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges.<ref>Strabo, Chapter 1, section 3.</ref> How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus had been part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] since 547 and was ruled by a [[satrap]], a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play [[knucklebones]] with the youths in the temple of [[Artemis]] and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (''politeia'') was ''pon\u00eara'',<ref name=\"ix2\">[[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ix. 2</ref> which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and [[Darius I]], quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.<ref>[[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] (2010), ''Heraclitus: The Cosmic Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, p. 1. {{ISBN|0521136679}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to education, Diogenes says that Heraclitus was \"wondrous\" (''thaumasios'', which, as [[Socrates]] explains in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' and ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', is the beginning of philosophy) from childhood. Diogenes relates that [[Sotion]] said he was a \"hearer\" of [[Xenophanes]], which contradicts Heraclitus' statement (so says Diogenes) that he had taught himself by questioning himself. [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] states in any case that \"...&nbsp;Xenophanes left Ionia before Herakleitos was born.\"<ref>Chapter 3 beginning.</ref> Diogenes relates that as a boy Heraclitus had said he \"knew nothing\" but later claimed to \"know everything\".<ref name=\"ix5\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 5</ref> His statement that he \"heard no one\" but \"questioned himself\", can be placed alongside his statement that \"the things that can be seen, heard and learned are what I prize the most.\"<ref>DK B55.</ref>\n\nDiogenes relates that Heraclitus had a poor opinion of human affairs.<ref name=\"ix1\"/> He believed that [[Hesiod]] and [[Pythagoras]] lacked understanding though learned<ref>DK B40.</ref> and that [[Homer]] and [[Archilochus]] deserved to be beaten.<ref>DK B42.</ref> Laws needed to be defended as though they were city walls.<ref>DK B44.</ref> [[Timon of Phlius]] is said to have called him a \"mob-reviler\". Heraclitus hated the [[Athens|Athenians]] and his fellow Ephesians, wishing the latter wealth in punishment for their wicked ways.<ref>DK B125a.</ref> According to [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]]: \"Finally, he became a hater of his kind (''misanthrope'') and wandered the mountains [...] making his diet of grass and herbs.\"\n\nHeraclitus' life as a philosopher was interrupted by [[Edema|dropsy]]. The physicians he consulted were unable to prescribe a cure. Diogenes lists various stories about Heraclitus' death: In two versions, Heraclitus was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. In one account, however, the philosopher \"buried himself in a [[cowshed]], expecting that the noxious damp [[Humorism|humour]] would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure\", while another says he treated himself with a [[liniment]] of cow manure and, after a day prone in the sun, died and was interred in the marketplace.  According to Neathes of Cyzicus, after smearing himself with dung, Heraclitus was devoured by dogs.<ref name=\"ix4\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ix. 4</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fairweather |first=Janet |url=http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/9121/4593 |title=Death of Heraclitus |year=1973 |page=2}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Raphael School of Athens Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Heraclitus (with the face and in the style of [[Michelangelo]]) sits apart from the other philosophers in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]''.]]\n{{main article|On Nature (Heraclitus)}}\nDiogenes states that Heraclitus' work was \"a continuous treatise ''On Nature'', but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology.\" [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes) \"...some parts of his work [are] half-finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley.\"<ref name=\"ix6\"/>\n\nDiogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BCE and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances; furthermore, many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work. Says [[Charles Kahn|Kahn]]:<ref name=\"kahn\"/> \"Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out.\" Diogenes says:<ref name=\"ix6\"/> \"the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called Heracliteans.\"\n\nAs with the other pre-Socratics, his writings survive now only in [[:s:Fragments of Heraclitus|fragments]] quoted by other authors. These are catalogued using the [[Diels\u2013Kranz numbering]] system.\n\n==Ancient characterizations==\n\n===\"The Obscure\"===\nAt some time in antiquity he acquired this epithet denoting that his major sayings were difficult to understand.

He typically uses the ordinary word \"to become\" (''gignesthai'' or ''ginesthai'', present tense or aorist tense of the verb, with the root sense of \"being born\"), which led to his being characterized as the philosopher of becoming rather than of being. He recognizes the fundamental changing of objects with the flow of time.\n\n[[Plato]] argues against Heraclitus as follows:<ref>[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] Paragraph 440 sections c-d.</ref><blockquote>How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state? ... for at the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other ... so that you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state .... but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever ... then I do not think they can resemble a process or flux ....</blockquote>\n\nIn Plato one experienced unit is a state, or object existing, which can be observed. The time parameter is set at \"ever\"; that is, the state is to be presumed present between observations. Change is to be deduced by comparing observations and is thus presumed a function that ''happens to'' objects already in being, rather than something ontologically essential to them (such that something that does not change cannot exist) as in Heraclitus. In Plato, no matter how many of those experienced units you are able to tally, you cannot get through the mysterious gap between them to account for the change that must be occurring there. This limitation is considered a fundamental limitation of reality by Plato and in part underpins his differentiation between imperfect experience from more perfect [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. The fact that this is no limitation for Heraclitus motivates Plato's condemnation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Stoics===\n[[Stoicism]] was a philosophical school which flourished between the 3rd century BC and about the 3rd century AD.

In addition to seeing it as the most fundamental of the four elements and the one that is quantified and determines the quantity (''logos'') of the other three, he presents fire as the cosmos, which was not made by any of the gods or men, but \"was and is and ever shall be ever-living fire.\"<ref>DK B60.</ref> Fire is both a substance and a motivator of change, it is active in altering other things quantitatively and performing an activity Heraclitus describes as \"the judging and convicting of all things.\"<ref>DK B66.</ref> It is \"the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\"<ref>DK B64.</ref> There is no reason to interpret the judgement, which is actually \"to separate\" (\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''krinein''), as outside of the context of \"strife is justice\" (see subsection above).\n\nThe earliest surviving Stoic work, the ''Hymn to Zeus'' of [[Cleanthes]],<ref>Different translations of this critical piece of literature, transitional from pagan polytheism to the modern religions and philosophies, can be found at {{cite web |first=T.W. |last=Rolleston |title=Stoic Philosophers: Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus |url=http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/4617/stoic/zeus.html |publisher=www.numinism.net |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805153252/http://geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/4617/stoic/zeus.html |archivedate=2009-08-05 }} {{cite web |first=M.A.C. |last=Ellery |title=Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/citylife/readings/cleanthes_hymn.html |publisher=Tom Sienkewicz at http://www.utexas.edu |year=1976 |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224143142/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/citylife/readings/cleanthes_hymn.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }} {{cite web |translator=not stated |title=Hymn to Zeus |url=http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Cleanthes.html |publisher=Holy, Holy, Holy at thriceholy.net: Hypatia's Bookshelf }}</ref> though not explicitly referencing Heraclitus, adopts what appears to be the Heraclitean logos modified.

Philo uses the term Logos throughout his treatises on Hebrew Scripture in a manner clearly influenced by the Stoics.\n\n===Church fathers===\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Democritus|Democriet]] (laughing) & Herakliet (crying) by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]]]]\nThe [[church fathers]] were the leaders of the early [[Christian Church]] during its first five centuries of existence, roughly contemporaneous to Stoicism under the [[Roman Empire]]. The works of dozens of writers in hundreds of pages have survived.\n\nAll of them had something to say about the Christian form of the [[Logos]]. The Catholic Church found it necessary to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other [[Pre-Socratics]] (and [[Platonic Academy|Academics]]) as sources of [[heresy]]. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.\n\nIn ''Refutation of All Heresies''<ref>Book IX leading sentence.</ref> Hippolytus says: \"What the blasphemous folly is of [[Noetus]], and that he devoted himself to the tenets of Heraclitus the Obscure, not to those of Christ.\" Hippolytus then goes on to present the inscrutable DK B67: \"God (''theos'') is day and night, winter and summer, ... but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.\" The fragment seems to support [[pantheism]] if taken literally. German physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernard Weinstein]] classed these views with [[pandeism]].<ref name=\"Weinstein-Greece\">Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\") (1910), p. 233: \"Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herr\u00fchren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abk\u00fchlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet.

He cannot accuse Heraclitus of being a heretic so he says instead: \"Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate Noetus in framing a system ...?\" The apparent pantheist deity of Heraclitus (if that is what DK B67 means) must be equal to the union of opposites and therefore must be corporeal and incorporeal, divine and not-divine, dead and alive, etc., and the [[Trinity]] can only be reached by some sort of illusory shape-shifting.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hippolytus |title=Refutation of All Heresies |pages=Book IX Chapter 5 |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050109.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]], however, took a much more positive view of him.

Following his selection, Schmitt spent his first year at [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] [[Undergraduate Pilot Training|UPT]] learning to become a jet pilot. Upon his return to the astronaut corps in Houston, he played a key role in training Apollo crews to be [[geologic]] observers when they were in lunar orbit and competent geologic field workers when they were on the lunar surface. After each of the landing missions, he participated in the examination and evaluation of the returned lunar samples and helped the crews with the scientific aspects of their mission reports.\n\nSchmitt spent considerable time becoming proficient in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] systems.  In March 1970 he became the first of the scientist-astronauts to be assigned to space flight, joining [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.]] (Commander) and [[Vance Brand]] (Command Module Pilot) on the [[Apollo 15]] backup crew. The flight rotation put these three in line to fly as prime crew on the third following mission, Apollo 18. When [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo flights 18 and 19 were cancelled]] in September 1970, the community of lunar [[geologist]]s supporting Apollo felt so strongly about the need to land a professional geologist on the Moon, that they pressured [[NASA]] to reassign Schmitt to a remaining flight. As a result, Schmitt was assigned in August 1971 to fly on the last mission, [[Apollo 17]], replacing [[Joe Engle]] as Lunar Module Pilot. Schmitt landed on the Moon with commander [[Gene Cernan]] in December 1972.<ref name=a17pre>{{cite web|title=A Running Start \u2013 Apollo 17 up to Powered Descent Initiation|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233958/http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|archivedate=March 20, 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nSchmitt claims to have taken the photograph of the [[Earth]] known as ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', possibly one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/the-blue-marble-shot-our-first-complete-photograph-of-earth/237167/|title=The Blue Marble Shot: Our First Complete Photograph of Earth|last1=Reinert|first1=Al|date=April 12, 2011|publisher=The Atlantic}}</ref> NASA officially credits the image to the entire Apollo 17 crew.\n\nWhile on the Moon's surface, Schmitt&nbsp;\u2014 the only geologist in the astronaut corps&nbsp;\u2014 collected the rock sample designated [[Troctolite 76535]], which has been called \"without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/compendium.cfm|title=Lunar Sample Compendium|author=Nancy S.

The term \"hammer\" also applies to a mechanism's part that delivers a blow, such as the hammer of [[hammer (firearm)|a firearm]] or of a [[piano]]. \n\nThe [[claw hammer]] has a \"claw\" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers used in many [[tradesman|trades]] include [[sledgehammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, and [[ball-peen hammer]]s.

The first hammers were without handles. <https://langs.co.uk/blog/2017/06/30/the-history-of-the-hammer-from-its-prehistoric-beginnings/> Later stones attached to sticks with strips of leather or animal sinew were being used as hammers with handles by about 30,000 BCE during the middle of the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Stone Age]].  The addition of a handle gave the user better control abilities and less accidents. <https://langs.co.uk/blog/2017/06/30/the-history-of-the-hammer-from-its-prehistoric-beginnings/>. The hammer became the number one tool.

This two-piece design is often used to combine a dense metallic striking head with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce [[muscle fatigue|user fatigue]] from repeated strikes). If wood is used for the handle, it is often [[hickory]] or [[ash (tree)|ash]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2052/what-are-some-suitable-woods-to-use-for-tool-handles|title=What are some suitable woods to use for tool handles?|website=woodworking.stackexchange.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Hammer.html|title=How hammer is made - material, making, history, used, components, structure, steps|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}</ref> which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate [[shock wave]]s from the hammer head. Rigid [[fiberglass|fiberglass resin]] may be used for the handle; this material does not absorb water or decay but does not dissipate shock as well as wood.\n\nA loose hammer head is hazardous because it can literally \"fly off the handle\" when in use, becoming a dangerous uncontrolled missile. Wooden handles can often be replaced when worn or damaged; specialized kits are available covering a range of handle sizes and designs, plus special wedges for attachment.\n\nSome hammers are one-piece designs made mostly of a single material. A one-piece metallic hammer may optionally have its handle coated or wrapped in a resilient material such as rubber, for improved grip and to reduce user fatigue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/08/06/hammers.html|title=A beginner's guide to hammers|date=6 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe hammer head may be surfaced with a variety of materials including [[brass]], [[bronze]], wood, plastic, rubber, or leather. Some hammers have interchangeable striking surfaces, which can be selected as needed or replaced when worn out.\n\n== Designs and variations ==\n[[File:Peen hammers.png|thumb|The parts of a hammer are the ''face'', ''head'' (includes the ''bell'' and ''neck'', which are not labeled), ''eye'' (where the ''handle'' fits into), ''peen'' (also spelled pein and pane). The side of a hammer is the ''cheek'' and some hammers have ''straps'' that extend down the handle for strength. Shown here are: A. Ball-peen hammer B. Straight-peen hammer C. Cross-peen hammer]]\n[[File:Prying up a long nail.jpg|thumb|upright|The claw of a carpenter's hammer is frequently used to remove nails.]]\nA large hammer-like tool is a ''maul'' (sometimes called a \"beetle\"), a wood- or rubber-headed hammer is a ''[[mallet]]'', and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a ''[[hatchet]]''. The essential part of a hammer is the head, a compact solid mass that is able to deliver a blow to the intended target without itself deforming. The impacting surface of the tool is usually flat or slightly rounded; the opposite end of the impacting mass may have a ball shape, as in the [[ball-peen hammer]]. Some [[upholstery hammer]]s have a [[magnet]]ized face, to pick up tacks. In the hatchet, the flat hammer head may be secondary to the cutting edge of the tool.\n\nThe impact between steel hammer heads and the objects being hit can create [[Spark (fire)|sparks]], which may ignite [[flammable]] or explosive gases. These are a hazard in some industries such as [[underground coal mining]] (due to the presence of [[methane]] gas), or in other hazardous environments such as [[petroleum refineries]] and chemical plants. In these environments, a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used, primarily made of [[aluminium]] or [[beryllium copper]]. In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used because of its shock-absorbing qualities and repair-ability.\n\n===Hand-powered hammers===\n* [[Ball-peen hammer]],<ref name=\"bs876\">''British Standard BS 876:1995 Specification for Hand Hammers''</ref> or mechanic's hammer\n* Boiler scaling hammer<ref name=\"bs876\" />\n* Brass hammer, also known as non-sparking hammer or spark-proof hammer and used mainly in flammable areas like oil fields\n* Carpenter's hammer (used for nailing), such as the [[framing hammer]] and the [[claw hammer]], and pinhammers (ball-peen and cross-peen types)<ref name=\"bs876\" />\n* Cow hammer \u2013 sometimes used for [[animal slaughter|livestock slaughter]], a practice now [[deprecation|deprecated]] due to [[animal cruelty|animal welfare]] objections<ref name=FAO>{{cite web|title=Slaughter of livestock|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6909e/x6909e09.htm|website=FAO Corporate Document Repository|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=2015-07-10}}</ref>\n* Cross-peen hammer,<ref name=\"bs876\" /> having one round face and one wedge-peen face.\n* [[Dead blow hammer]] delivers impact with very little recoil, often due to a hollow head filled with sand, [[lead shot]] or pellets\n* [[Lump hammer|Drilling hammer]] \u2013 a short handled sledgehammer originally used for drilling in rock with a chisel.

They include:\n* [[Hammer drill]], that combines a jackhammer-like mechanism with a [[drill]]\n* [[High Frequency Impact Treatment]] hammer \u2014 for aftertreatment of weld transitions\n* [[Jackhammer]]\n* [[Steam hammer]]\n* [[Trip hammer]]\nIn professional [[framing (construction)|framing]] [[carpenter|carpentry]], the manual hammer has almost been completely replaced by the [[nail gun]]. In professional [[upholstery]], its chief competitor is the [[staple gun]].\n\n==Tools used in conjunction with hammers==\n* [[Anvil]]\n* [[Chisel]]\n* [[Pipe drift]] (Blacksmithing - spreading a punched hole to proper size and/or shape)\n* [[Star drill]]\n* [[Punch (engineering)|Punch]]\n* [[Splitting maul|Woodsplitting maul]] \u2013 can be hit with a sledgehammer for splitting wood.\n* [[Wedge (mechanical device)|Woodsplitting wedge]] \u2013 hit with a sledgehammer for splitting wood.\n\n==Physics of hammering==\n\n===Hammer as a force amplifier===\nA hammer is a simple [[force]] [[amplifier]] that works by converting [[mechanical work]] into [[kinetic energy]] and back.\n\nIn the swing that precedes each blow, the hammer head stores a certain amount of kinetic energy\u2014equal to the length ''D'' of the swing times the force ''f'' produced by the [[muscle]]s of the arm and by [[gravity]]. When the hammer strikes, the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target, equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target. If the target is a hard and heavy object, or if it is resting on some sort of [[anvil]], the head can travel only a very short distance ''d'' before stopping. Since the stopping force ''F'' times that distance must be equal to the head's kinetic energy, it follows that ''F'' is much greater than the original driving force ''f''\u2014roughly, by a factor ''D''/''d''. In this way, great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel, or crack granite.\n\n===Effect of the head's mass===\nThe amount of energy delivered to the target by the hammer-blow is equivalent to one half the mass of the head times the square of the head's speed at the time of impact <math>(E={mv^2 \\over 2})</math>. While the energy delivered to the target increases linearly with mass, it increases quadratically with the [[speed]] (see the effect of the handle, below). High tech [[titanium]] heads are lighter and allow for longer handles, thus increasing velocity and delivering the same energy with less arm fatigue than that of a heavier steel head hammer.<ref>{{cite web |title=DeWalt\u2019s Titanium Hammer Killer? |url=http://toolmonger.com/2011/06/15/dewalts-titanium-hammer-killer/ |date=2011-06-15 |author=Cage, Chuck |publisher=Toolmonger |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref> A titanium head has about 3% [[Deflection (physics)|recoil]] energy and can result in greater efficiency and less fatigue when compared to a steel head with up to 30% recoil. [[Dead blow hammer]]s use special rubber or steel shot to absorb recoil energy, rather than bouncing the hammer head after impact.\n\n===Effect of the handle===\nThe handle of the hammer helps in several ways. It keeps the user's hands away from the point of impact. It provides a broad area that is better-suited for gripping by the hand. Most importantly, it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow. The primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer. This is why sledgehammers, largely used in open spaces, can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter's hammer. The second most important constraint is more subtle. Even without considering the effects of fatigue, the longer the handle, the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed.\n\nMost designs are a compromise between practicality and energy efficiency. With too long a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place, off-target. With too short a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it doesn't deliver enough force, requiring more blows to complete a given task. Modifications have also been made with respect to the effect of the hammer on the user. Handles made of shock-absorbing materials or varying angles attempt to make it easier for the user to continue to wield this age-old device, even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use.\n\nAs hammers must be used in many circumstances, where the position of the person using them cannot be taken for granted, trade-offs are made for the sake of practicality. In areas where one has plenty of room, a long handle with a heavy head (like a sledgehammer) can deliver the maximum amount of energy to the target. It is not practical to use such a large hammer for all tasks, however, and thus the overall design has been modified repeatedly to achieve the optimum utility in a wide variety of situations.\n\n===Effect of gravity===\nGravity exerts a force on the hammer head. If hammering downwards, gravity increases the acceleration during the hammer stroke and increases the energy delivered with each blow. If hammering upwards, gravity reduces the acceleration during the hammer stroke and therefore reduces the energy delivered with each blow. Some hammering methods, such as traditional mechanical [[pile driver]]s, rely entirely on gravity for acceleration on the down stroke.\n\n==Ergonomics and injury risks==\nA hammer may cause significant injury if it strikes the body. Both manual and powered hammers can cause [[peripheral neuropathy]] or a variety of other ailments when used improperly. Awkward handles can cause [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI) to hand and arm joints, and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton. Additionally, striking metal objects with a hammer may produce small metallic projectiles which can become lodged in the eye. It is therefore recommended to wear safety glasses.\n\n==War hammers==\n{{Main article|War hammer}}\nA war hammer is a [[late medieval]] [[weapon]] of [[war]] intended for [[close combat]] action.\n\n==Symbolic hammers==\nThe hammer, being one of the most used tools by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', has been used very much in symbols such as [[flag]]s and [[heraldry]]. In the Middle Ages, it was used often in blacksmith guild logos, as well as in many family symbols. The [[hammer and pick]] are used as a symbol of mining.\n\nA well-known symbol with a hammer in it is the [[Hammer and Sickle]], which was the symbol of the former [[Soviet Union]] and is strongly linked to [[communism]] and early [[socialism]]. Mythology includes hammers for their Gods. Thor, Hercules and Sucello all had hammers that appear in their lore and carried different meanings. <https://norse-mythology.org/symbols/thors-hammer/> The hammer in this symbol represents the industrial working class (and the sickle represents the agricultural working class). The hammer is used in some coat of arms in (former) socialist countries like [[East Germany]]. Similarly, the Hammer and Sword symbolizes [[Strasserism]], a strand of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] seeking to appeal to the working class.\n\nThe [[gavel]], a small wooden mallet, is used to symbolize a mandate to preside over a meeting or judicial proceeding, and a graphic image of one is used as a symbol of legislative or judicial decision-making authority.\n\nIn [[Norse mythology]], [[Thor]], the god of thunder and lightning, wields a hammer named [[Mj\u00f6lnir]]. Many artifacts of decorative hammers have been found, leading modern practitioners of this religion to often wear reproductions as a sign of their faith.\n\n[[Judah Maccabee]] was nicknamed \"The Hammer\", possibly in recognition of his ferocity in battle. The name \"Maccabee\" may derive from the [[Aramaic]] ''maqqaba''. (see {{section link|Judah Maccabee|Origin of Name \"The Hammer\"}}.)\n\nIn [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]], the hammer of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] represents the strength and endurance of a man.\n\nThe hammer in the song \"[[If I Had a Hammer]]\" represents a relentless message of justice broadcast across the land. The song became a symbol of the [[civil rights movement]].\n\n==Image gallery==\n<!-- Please ALPHABETIZE any additions -->\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Ball-peen hammer 380mm.JPG|[[Ball-peen hammer]]\nFile:Hammer ball pane.jpg|[[Ball-peen hammer|Ball peen hammer]]\nFile:Stockhammer.JPG|[[Bush hammer]]\nFile:hammer2.jpg|[[Claw hammer]]\nFile:Hammer-1.jpg|[[Cross-peen hammer]]\nFile:Hammer dog-head.jpg|Dog-head hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Framing hammer.jpg|[[Framing hammer]]\nFile:BrokenConcretion22.jpg|[[Geologist's hammer]]\nFile:hifit-hammer.jpg|HiFIT-hammer for aftertreatment of weld transitions\nFile:Hammer Long cross-face.jpg|Long cross-face hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Sledgehammer.jpg|Post maul\nFile:Climbing Hammer.png|[[Rock climbing hammer]]\nFile:Mallet.jpg|Rubber mallet\nFile:Sledgehammers-1.jpg|[[Sledgehammer]]s\nFile:Hammer straight pane sledge.jpg|Straight pane [[sledgehammer]]\nFile:Hammer twist.jpg|Twist hammer (blacksmithing)\nFile:Hammer tapissier.jpg|[[Upholstery hammer]]\nFile:Wooden mallet.jpg|Wooden [[mallet]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Technology}}\n* [[Hammer Museum (Haines, Alaska)]]\n* [[Mj\u00f6lnir]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hammers}}\n{{Wiktionary|hammer}}\n* [https://www.garagetooladvisor.com/hand-tools/different-types-of-hammers-and-their-uses/ Types of Hammers] (images and descriptions)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=1CoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA164&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&sa=X&ei=awL8TqCkMcfXgQfW7uTxCQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzhu#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Choosing a Hammer\".] ''Popular Science'', June 1960, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013167.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Hand tools}}\n{{Metalworking navbox|toolopen}}\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Hammers|*]]\n[[Category:Woodworking hand tools]]\n[[Category:Metalworking tools]]", "sha1": "c44v1cjm16is1n8w5c08to6543ni486"}}, {"title": "Hiragana", "ns": "0", "id": "13804", "revision": {"id": "866474538", "parentid": "866467692", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T15:22:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "W like wiki", "id": "2128794"}, "comment": "/* Table of hiragana */ Missing information: why are some pronunciations in bold", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2009}}\n{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n{{Infobox writing system\n|name=Hiragana<br />\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a\n|type=[[Syllabary]]\n|languages=[[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] and [[Okinawan writing system|Okinawan]]\n|time=~800 AD to the present\n|fam1=[[Oracle Bone Script]]\n|fam2=[[Seal Script]]\n|fam3=[[Clerical Script]]\n|fam4=[[Regular script]] ([[Kanji]])\n|fam5=[[Man'y\u014dgana]]\n|sisters=[[Katakana]], [[Hentaigana]]\n|iso15924=Hira\n|sample=\u3072 \u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u4f53.svg\n|unicode=[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3040.pdf U+3040-U+309F] Hiragana, <br />[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1B000.pdf U+1B000-U+1B0FF] {{nobr|Kana Supplement}}\n|imagesize=100px\n}} \n{{Japanese writing}}\n{{nihongo|'''''Hiragana'''''|[[wikt:\u5e73\u4eee\u540d|\u5e73\u4eee\u540d]], \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a||{{IPA-ja|\u00e7i\u027ea\u0261ana}}}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[syllabary]], one component of the [[Japanese writing system]], along with ''[[katakana]]'', ''[[kanji]]'', and in some cases ''[[r\u014dmaji]]'' ([[Latin script]]).

With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language (strictly, each [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]) is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be either a vowel such as ''\"a\"'' (hiragana [[wikt:\u3042|\u3042]]); a consonant followed by a vowel such as ''\"ka\"'' ([[wikt:\u304b|\u304b]]); or ''\"n\"'' ([[wikt:\u3093|\u3093]]), a [[nasal stop|nasal]] [[sonorant]] which, depending on the context, sounds either like English ''m'', ''n'', or ''ng'' ({{IPAblink|\u014b}}), or like the [[nasal vowel]]s of [[French language|French]]. Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of \u3093 \"n\"), the kana are referred to as syllabaries and not alphabets.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Modern Japanese: Book 1|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0521548878|author=Richard Bowring|author2=Haruko Uryu Laurie|page=9}}</ref>\n\nHiragana is used to write ''[[okurigana]]'' (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including [[Japanese particles|particles]], as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no [[kanji]] or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Xuexin|title=Japanese Simplification of Chinese Characters in Perspective|journal=Southeast Review of Asian Studies|date=2009|volume=31}}</ref> Words that do have common kanji renditions may also sometimes be written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference, for example to impart an informal feel. Hiragana is also used to write ''[[furigana]]'', a reading aid that shows the [[pronunciation]] of kanji characters.\n\nThere are two main systems of [[Kana#Collation|ordering hiragana]]: the old-fashioned [[iroha]] ordering and the more prevalent [[goj\u016bon]] ordering.\n\n==Writing system==\n{| align=right border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"padding:2px;margin-left:1em;\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|+ Hiragana base characters\n|-\n! !!

Of the 50 theoretically possible combinations, ''yi'' and ''wu'' do not exist in the language, and ''ye'', ''wi'' and ''we'' are obsolete (or virtually obsolete) in modern Japanese. ''wo'' is usually pronounced as a vowel (''o'') in modern Japanese, and is preserved in only one use, as a [[grammatical particle|particle]].\n\n[[Romanization of Japanese|Romanization]] of the kana does not always strictly follow the consonant-vowel scheme laid out in the table. For example, \u3061, nominally ''ti'', is very often romanised as ''chi'' in an attempt to better represent the actual sound in Japanese.\n\nThese basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a ''[[dakuten]]'' marker (&nbsp;\u309b), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant: ''k''\u2192''g'', ''ts/s''\u2192''z'', ''t''\u2192''d'', ''h''\u2192''b'' and ''ch''/''sh''\u2192''j''. For example, \u304b (''ka'') becomes \u304c (''ga''). Hiragana beginning with an ''h'' can also add a ''[[handakuten]]'' marker (&nbsp;\u309c) changing the ''h'' to a ''p''. For example, \u306f (''ha'') becomes \u3071 (''pa'').\n\nA small version of the hiragana for ''ya'', ''yu'', or ''yo'' (\u3083, \u3085 or \u3087 respectively) may be added to hiragana ending in ''i''. This changes the ''i'' vowel sound to a glide ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]) to ''a'', ''u'' or ''o''. For example, \u304d (''ki'') plus \u3083 (small ''ya'') becomes {{nowrap|\u304d\u3083}} (''kya''). Addition of the small ''y'' kana is called ''[[y\u014don]]''.\n\nA small ''tsu'' \u3063, called a ''[[sokuon]]'', indicates that the following consonant is [[geminated]] (doubled). In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation; for example, compare {{nowrap|\u3055\u304b}} ''saka'' \"hill\" with {{nowrap|\u3055\u3063\u304b}} ''sakka'' \"author\". The ''sokuon'' also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a [[glottal stop]], as in {{nowrap|\u3044\u3066\u3063!}} ({{IPA-ja|ite\u0294|}} Ouch!).  However, it cannot be used to double the ''na'', ''ni'', ''nu'', ''ne'', ''no'' syllables' consonants \u2013 to double these, the singular ''n'' (\u3093) is added in front of the syllable, as in \u307f\u3093\u306a (''minna'', \"all\").\n\nHiragana usually spells [[long vowel]]s with the addition of a second vowel kana; for example, \u304a\u304b\u3042\u3055\u3093 (''o-ka-a-sa-n'', \"mother\"). The ''[[ch\u014donpu]]'' (long vowel mark) (\u30fc) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word {{nowrap|\u3089\u30fc\u3081\u3093}}, ''[[r\u0101men]]'', but this usage is considered non-standard in Japanese; the [[Okinawan language]] uses ch\u014donpu with hiragana. In informal writing, small versions of the five vowel kana are sometimes used to represent trailing off sounds ({{nowrap|\u306f\u3041}} ''haa'', {{nowrap|\u306d\u3047}} ''nee''). Standard and voiced [[Iteration mark#Japanese|iteration marks]] are written in hiragana as \u309d and \u309e respectively.\n\n==Table of hiragana==\n{{Missing information|why are some pronunciations in bold|talksection=Table of hiragana: some pronunciations in boldface|date=October 2018}}\nThe following table shows the complete hiragana together with the [[Hepburn romanization]] and [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription in the ''goj\u016bon'' order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/english/syllabary/hiragana_english.pdf|title=The Japanese Syllabaries (Hiragana)|last=NHK|first=WORLD|date=|website=www.nhk.or.jp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Hiragana with ''dakuten'' or ''handakuten'' follow the ''goj\u016bon'' kana without them, with the ''y\u014don'' kana following.

An exception to this is numerals; 15 ''j\u016bgo'' is considered to be one word, but is pronounced as if it was ''j\u016b'' and ''go'' stacked end to end: {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0291\u026f\u02d0\u0261o]}}.\n\nIn many accents, the ''j'' and ''z'' sounds are pronounced as [[affricate]]s ({{IPA|[d\u0361\u0291]}} and {{IPA|[d\u0361z]}}, respectively) at the beginning of utterances and fricatives {{IPA|[\u0291, z]}} in the middle of words. For example, {{nowrap|\u3059\u3046\u3058}} ''s\u016bji'' {{IPA|[s\u026f\u02d0\u0291i]}} 'number', {{nowrap|\u3056\u3063\u3057}} ''zasshi'' {{IPA|[d\u0361za\u0255\u0255i]}} 'magazine'.\n\nIn archaic forms of Japanese, there existed the ''kwa'' ({{lang|ja|\u304f\u308e}} {{IPA-ja|k\u02b7a|}}) and ''gwa'' ({{lang|ja|\u3050\u308e}} {{IPA-ja|\u0261\u02b7a|}}) digraphs. In modern Japanese, these phonemes have been phased out of usage and only exist in the extended [[katakana]] digraphs for approximating foreign language words.\n\nThe singular ''n'' is pronounced {{IPA|[n]}} before ''t'', ''ch'', ''ts'', ''n'', ''r'', ''z'', ''j'' and ''d'', {{IPA|[m]}} before ''m'', ''b'' and ''p'', {{IPA|[\u014b]}} before ''k'' and ''g'', {{IPA|[\u0274]}} at the end of utterances, and some kind of [[Close vowel|high]] [[nasal vowel]] {{IPA|[\u0270\u0303]}} before vowels, palatal approximants (''y''), [[fricative consonant]]s ''s'', ''sh'', ''h'', ''f'' and ''w''.\n\nIn kanji readings, the diphthongs ''ou'' and ''ei'' are today usually pronounced {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} (long o) and {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} (long e) respectively. For example, {{nowrap|\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046}} (lit. ''toukyou'') is pronounced {{IPA|[to\u02d0k\u02b2o\u02d0]}} 'Tokyo', and {{nowrap|\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044}} ''sensei'' is {{IPA|[se\u026f\u0303se\u02d0]}} 'teacher'. However, {{nowrap|\u3068\u3046}} ''tou'' is pronounced {{IPA|[to\u026f]}} 'to inquire', because the ''o'' and ''u'' are considered distinct, ''u'' being the infinitive verb ending. Similarly, {{nowrap|\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b}} ''shite iru'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0255itei\u027e\u026f]}} 'is doing'.\n\nFor a more thorough discussion on the sounds of Japanese, please refer to [[Japanese phonology]].\n\n== Obsolete Kana ==\n\n=== Ye ===\nAn early, now obsolete, hiragana-esque form of ''ye'' may have existed ([[\ud82c\udc01|<big style=\"color:#808080\">&#x1B001;</big>]] {{IPA-ja|je|}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1B000.pdf|title=Unicode Kana Supplement|author=|date=|website=unicode.org}}</ref>) in pre-Classical Japanese (prior to the advent of [[kana]]), but is generally represented for purposes of reconstruction by the kanji \u6c5f, and its hiragana form is not present in any known orthography.

This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as [[historical kana usage]], differed substantially from pronunciation; the three above-mentioned exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system.\n\nThere are two hiragana pronounced ''ji'' (\u3058 and \u3062) and two hiragana pronounced ''zu'' (\u305a and \u3065), but to distinguish them, particularly when [[W\u0101puro r\u014dmaji|typing Japanese]], sometimes ''\u3062'' is written as ''di'' and ''\u3065'' is written as ''du''.  These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, ''ji'' is written as \u3058 and ''zu'' is written as \u305a. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a ''[[dakuten]]'' and the same syllable with a ''dakuten'', the same hiragana is used to write the sounds.  For example, ''chijimeru'' ('to boil down' or 'to shrink') is spelled \u3061\u3062\u3081\u308b and ''tsuzuku'' ('to continue') is {{nowrap|\u3064\u3065\u304f}}. For compound words where the dakuten reflects ''[[rendaku]]'' voicing, the original hiragana is used. For example, ''chi'' ({{lang|ja|\u8840}} 'blood') is spelled \u3061 in plain hiragana. When {{lang|ja|\u9f3b}} ''hana'' ('nose') and {{lang|ja|\u8840}} ''chi'' ('blood') combine to make ''hanaji'' ({{lang|ja|\u9f3b\u8840}} 'nose bleed'), the sound of {{lang|ja|\u8840}} changes from ''chi'' to ''ji''.  So ''hanaji'' is spelled {{nowrap|\u306f\u306a\u3062}} according to \u3061: the basic hiragana used to transcribe {{lang|ja|\u8840}}. Similarly, ''tsukau'' ({{lang|ja|\u4f7f\u3046/\u9063\u3046}}; 'to use') is spelled {{nowrap|\u3064\u304b\u3046}} in hiragana, so ''kanazukai'' ({{lang|ja|\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u3044}}; 'kana use', or 'kana orthography') is spelled {{nowrap|\u304b\u306a\u3065\u304b\u3044}} in hiragana.\n\nHowever, this does not apply when kanji are used phonetically to write words that do not relate directly to the meaning of the kanji (see also [[ateji]]).  The Japanese word for 'lightning', for example, is ''inazuma'' ({{lang|ja|\u7a32\u59bb}}).  The {{lang|ja|\u7a32}} component means 'rice plant', is written {{nowrap|\u3044\u306a}} in hiragana and is pronounced: ''ina''.  The {{lang|ja|\u59bb}} component means 'wife' and is pronounced ''tsuma'' (\u3064\u307e) when written in isolation\u2014or frequently as ''zuma'' {{nowrap|(\u305a\u307e)}} when it features after another syllable. Neither of these components have anything to do with 'lightning', but together they do when they compose the word for 'lightning'. In this case, the default spelling in hiragana {{nowrap|\u3044\u306a\u305a\u307e}} rather than {{nowrap|\u3044\u306a\u3065\u307e}} is used.\n\nOfficially, \u3062 and \u3065 do not occur word-initially pursuant to modern spelling rules. There were words such as {{nowrap|\u3062\u3070\u3093}} ''jiban'' 'ground' in the [[historical kana usage]], but they were unified under \u3058 in the [[modern kana usage]] in 1946, so today it is spelled exclusively {{nowrap|\u3058\u3070\u3093}}. However, {{nowrap|\u3065\u3089}} ''zura'' 'wig' (from {{nowrap|\u304b\u3064\u3089}} ''katsura'') and {{nowrap|\u3065\u3051}} ''zuke'' (a sushi term for lean tuna soaked in soy sauce) are examples of word-initial \u3065 today. Some people write the word for hemorrhoids as \u3062 (normally \u3058) for emphasis.\n\nNo standard Japanese words begin with the kana \u3093 (''n''). This is the basis of the word game [[shiritori]]. \u3093 ''n'' is normally treated as its own syllable and is separate from the other ''n''-based kana (''na'', ''ni'' etc.). A notable exception to this{{Clarify|reason = unclear how this is an \"exception\" to anything that has been said|date=May 2010}} is the colloquial negative verb conjugation; for example {{nowrap|\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044}} ''wakaranai'' meaning \"[I] don't understand\" is rendered as {{nowrap|\u308f\u304b\u3089\u3093}} ''wakaran''. It is however not a contraction of the former, but instead comes from the classic negative verb conjugation \u306c ''nu'' ({{nowrap|\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306c}} ''wakaranu'').\n\n\u3093 is sometimes directly followed by a vowel (''a'', ''i'', ''u'', ''e'' or ''o'') or a palatal approximant (''ya'', ''yu'' or ''yo''). These are clearly distinct from the ''na'', ''ni'' etc. syllables, and there are [[minimal pair]]s such as {{nowrap|\u304d\u3093\u3048\u3093}} ''kin'en'' 'smoking forbidden', {{nowrap|\u304d\u306d\u3093}} ''kinen'' 'commemoration', {{nowrap|\u304d\u3093\u306d\u3093}} ''kinnen'' 'recent years'. In Hepburn romanization, they are distinguished with an apostrophe, but not all romanization methods make the distinction. For example, past prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]'s first name is actually {{nowrap|\u3058\u3085\u3093\u3044\u3061\u308d\u3046}} ''Jun'ichir\u014d'' pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0291u\u034d\u0169\u034dit\u0361\u0255i\u027eo\u02d0]}}\n\nThere are a few hiragana that are rarely used. \u3090 ''wi'' and \u3091 ''we'' are obsolete outside of Okinawan orthography. \ud82c\udc01 ''e'' was an alternate version of \u3048 ''e'' before spelling reform, and was briefly reused for ''ye'' during initial spelling reforms, but is now completely obsolete. \u3094 ''vu''  is a modern addition used to represent the /v/ sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese from a phonological standpoint does not have a /v/ sound, it is pronounced as /b/ and mostly serves as a more accurate indicator of a word's pronunciation in its original language. However, it is rarely seen because [[loanword]]s and [[Transliteration|transliterated]] words are usually written in [[katakana]], where the corresponding character would be written as \u30f4. {{nowrap|\u3062\u3083}}, {{nowrap|\u3062\u3085}}, {{nowrap|\u3062\u3087}} for ''ja''/''ju''/''jo'' are theoretically possible in [[rendaku]], but are practically never used. For example, {{nowrap|{{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u4e2d}}}} 'throughout Japan' could be written {{nowrap|\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3062\u3085\u3046}}, but is practically always {{nowrap|\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3058\u3085\u3046.}}\n\nThe {{nowrap|\u307f\u3085}} ''myu'' kana is extremely rare in originally Japanese words; linguist [[Haruhiko Kindaichi]] raises the example of the Japanese family name Omamy\u016bda {{nowrap|({{lang|ja|\u5c0f\u8c46\u751f\u7530}})}} and claims it is the only occurrence amongst pure Japanese words. Its [[katakana]] counterpart is used in many loanwords, however.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Man'y\u014dgana|Old Japanese#Sources and dating}}\n[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|left|Hiragana characters' shapes were derived from the Chinese [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] (''s\u014dsho'').

An Invitation to Contemporary Japanese'' 1st edition McGraw-Hill, page 13 \"Linguistic Note: The Origins of Hiragana and Katakana\"</ref> The oldest examples of Man'y\u014dgana include the [[Inariyama Sword]], an iron sword excavated at the Inariyama Kofun in 1968.

The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from many\u014dgana via cursive script. The upper part shows the character in the [[regular script]] form, the center character in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. Note also that the cursive script forms are not strictly confined to those in the illustration.\n\n[[File:Hiragana origin.svg|320px|right]] When it was first developed, hiragana was not accepted by everyone. The educated or elites preferred to use only the kanji system. Historically, in Japan, the regular script (''kaisho'') form of the characters was used by men and called {{nihongo|''otokode''|[[wikt:\u7537\u624b|\u7537\u624b]]|}}, \"men's writing\", while the cursive script (''s\u014dsho'') form of the kanji was used by women. Hence hiragana first gained popularity among women, who were generally not allowed access to the same levels of education as men. And thus hiragana was first widely used among court women in the writing of personal communications and literature.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Modern Japanese: Book 1|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0521548878|author=Richard Bowring|author2=Haruko Uryu Laurie|page=8}}</ref>  From this comes the alternative name of {{nihongo|''onnade''|[[wikt:\u5973\u624b|\u5973\u624b]]|}} \"women's writing\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hatasa|first=Yukiko Abe|title=Nakama 1: Introductory Japanese: Communication, Culture, Context 2nd ed.|year=2010|publisher=Heinle|isbn=0495798185|page=2|author2=Kazumi Hatasa |author3=Seiichi Makino }}</ref>  For example, ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and other early novels by female authors used hiragana extensively or exclusively.\n\nMale authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with [[katakana]] writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in [[transliteration]], the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.\n\nOriginally, for all syllables there was more than one possible hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each syllable had only one hiragana. The deprecated hiragana are now known as {{nihongo|[[hentaigana]]|\u5909\u4f53\u4eee\u540d|}}.\n\nThe [[pangram]] poem ''[[Iroha]]-uta'' (\"ABC song/poem\"), which dates to the 10th century, uses every hiragana once (except ''n'' \u3093, which was just a variant of \u3080 before the [[Muromachi era]]).\n\n== Stroke order and direction ==\nThe following table shows the method for writing each hiragana character. It is arranged in the traditional way, beginning top right and reading columns down. The numbers and arrows indicate the [[stroke order]] and direction respectively. <br>\n[[File:Table hiragana.svg|center]]\n\n== Unicode ==\n\n{{Main|Hiragana (Unicode block)|Kana Supplement|l2=Kana Supplement (Unicode block)}}\n\nHiragana was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040&ndash;U+309F:\n\n{{Unicode chart Hiragana}}\n\nThe Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and y\u014don kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic \u3090 ''wi'' and \u3091 ''we'' and the rare \u3094 ''vu''; the archaic \ud82c\udc01 ''ye'' is included in [[plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Multilingual Plane|plane 1]] at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with ''dakuten'' and ''handakuten'' used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.\n\nCharacters U+3095 and U+3096 are small \u304b (''ka'') and small \u3051 (''ke''), respectively.  U+309F is a ligature of [[Yori (kana)|\u3088\u308a]] (''yori'') occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.\n\nHistoric and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were first added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0, with significantly more added in 2017 as part of Unicode 10.\n\nThe Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000&ndash;U+1B0FF, and is immediately followed by the Kana Extended-A block (U+1B100&ndash;U+1B12F). These blocks include mainly [[hentaigana]] (historic or variant hiragana):\n\n{{Unicode chart Kana Supplement}}\n{{Unicode chart Kana Extended-A}}\n\nIn the following character sequences a kana from the /k/ row is modified by a ''handakuten'' combining mark to indicate that a syllable starts with an initial nasal, known as ''[[dakuten#Phonetic shifts|bidakuon]]''.

Besides Germany, they also ruled the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1194\u20131268). In Italian historiography, they are known as the ''Svevi'' (Swabians), since they were (successive) [[Duke of Swabia|dukes of Swabia]] from 1079. Three members of the dynasty\u2014[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]\u2014were crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Hohenstaufen Castle Ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Hohenstaufen Castle]]]]\nThe dynasty is named for their seat at [[Hohenstaufen Castle]], which was in turn named for a nearby [[conical hill]] of the [[Swabian Jura]] with the name [[Hohenstaufen (mountain)|Hohenstaufen]] (now in [[G\u00f6ppingen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]).<ref>The name \"Staufen\" derives from ''Stauf'' (formerly ''stouf'' and akin to [[Early Modern English]] ''[[wiktionary:stoup|stoup]]''), meaning \"[[chalice]]\", and was commonly applied to conical hills in Swabia in the Middle Ages.</ref>\n\nThe historical form of the name is ''Staufen''. The form ''Hohenstaufen'' (\"high ''Staufen''\") is modern (19th century), introduced for disambiguation from other castles with the same name. In more recent literature, the historical name ''Staufen'' seems to regain prominence.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia fridericiana |title=Hohenstaufen, famiglia \n|first=Hansmartin |last=Schwarzmaier |date=2005 \n|location=Rome |publisher=Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana \n|translator=Maria Paola Arena |language=Italian\n|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/famiglia-hohenstaufen_%28Federiciana%29/\n|access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe noble family first appeared in the late 10th century in the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabian]] ''Riesgau'' region around the former [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]]. A local count Frederick (d. about 1075) is mentioned as progenitor in a pedigree drawn up by Abbot [[Wibald|Wibald of Stavelot]] at the behest of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1153. He held the office of a Swabian [[count palatine]]; his son Frederick of [[W\u00e4schenbeuren|Buren]] (c.1020\u20131053) married Hildegard of [[Eguisheim|Egisheim]]-[[County of Dagsburg|Dagsburg]] (d. 1094/95), a niece of [[Pope Leo IX]]. Their son [[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia|Frederick I]] was appointed [[Duke of Swabia]] at Hohenstaufen Castle by the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Germany]] in 1079.\n\nAt the same time, Duke Frederick I was engaged to the king's approximately seventeen-year-old daughter, [[Agnes of Germany|Agnes]]. Nothing is known about Frederick's life before this event, but he proved to be an imperial ally throughout Henry's struggles against other Swabian lords, namely [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], Frederick's predecessor, and the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] and [[House of Welf|Welf]] lords.  Frederick's brother Otto was elevated to the [[bishop of Strasbourg|Strasbourg bishopric]] in 1082.\n\nUpon Frederick's death, he was succeeded by his son, Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Frederick II]], in 1105.  Frederick II remained a close ally of the Salians, he and his younger brother [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad]] were named the king's representatives in Germany when the king was in Italy.  Around 1120, Frederick II married Judith of Bavaria from the rival [[House of Welf]].\n\n==Ruling in Germany==\n[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|left|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] at its greatest extent in the early to middle 13th century under the Hohenstaufen dynasty (1155-1268).]]\nWhen the last male member of the Salian dynasty, Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], died without heirs in 1125, a controversy arose about the succession. Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Frederick II]] and [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad]], the two current male Staufers, by their mother Agnes, were grandsons of late Emperor Henry IV and nephews of Henry V. Frederick attempted to succeed to the throne of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (formally known as the [[King of the Romans]]) through a customary election, but lost to the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] duke [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]]. A civil war between Frederick's dynasty and Lothair's ended with Frederick's submission in 1134. After Lothair's death in 1137, Frederick's brother Conrad was elected King as Conrad III.\n{{House of Hohenstaufen}}\nBecause the [[House of Welf|Welf duke]] [[Henry the Proud]], son-in-law and heir of Lothair and the most powerful prince in Germany, who had been passed over in the election, refused to acknowledge the new king, Conrad III deprived him of all his territories, giving the [[Duchy of Saxony]] to [[Albert the Bear]] and that of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to [[Leopold&nbsp;IV, Margrave of Austria]]. In 1147, Conrad heard [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] preach the [[Second Crusade]] at [[Speyer]], and he agreed to join King [[Louis VII of France]] in a great [[Second Crusade|expedition]] to the [[Holy Land]] which failed.\n\nConrad's brother Duke Frederick II died in 1147, and was succeeded in Swabia by his son, Duke [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. When King Conrad III died without adult heir in 1152, Frederick also succeeded him, taking both German royal and Imperial titles.\n\n===Frederick Barbarossa===\nFrederick I, known as Frederick Barbarossa because of his red beard, struggled throughout his reign to restore the power and prestige of the German monarchy against the dukes, whose power had grown both before and after the [[Investiture Controversy]] under his Salian predecessors.  As royal access to the resources of the church in Germany was much reduced, Frederick was forced to go to [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]] to find the finances needed to restore the king's power in Germany. He was soon crowned emperor in Italy, but decades of warfare on the peninsula yielded scant results. The [[Papal States|Papacy]] and the prosperous city-states of the [[Lombard League]] in northern Italy were traditional enemies, but the fear of Imperial domination caused them to join ranks to fight Frederick. Under the skilled leadership of [[Pope Alexander III]], the alliance suffered many defeats but ultimately was able to deny the emperor a complete victory in Italy. Frederick returned to Germany. He had vanquished one notable opponent, his Welf cousin, Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of Saxony and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in 1180, but his hopes of restoring the power and prestige of the monarchy seemed unlikely to be met by the end of his life.\n\nDuring Frederick's long stays in Italy, the German princes became stronger and began a successful colonization of Slavic lands. Offers of reduced taxes and manorial duties enticed many Germans to settle in the east in the course of the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''. In 1163 Frederick waged a successful campaign against the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in order to re-install the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] dukes of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dynasty. With the German colonization, the Empire increased in size and came to include the [[Duchy of Pomerania]]. A quickening economic life in Germany increased the number of towns and [[Free imperial city|Imperial cities]], and gave them greater importance. It was also during this period that castles and courts replaced monasteries as centers of culture. Growing out of this courtly culture, [[Middle High German]] literature reached its peak in lyrical love poetry, the [[Minnesang]], and in narrative epic poems such as ''[[Tristan]]'', ''[[Parzival]]'', and the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.\n[[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his sons King Henry VI and Duke [[Frederick V, Duke of Swabia|Frederick V of Swabia]], ''Welfenchronik'', 1167/79, [[Weingarten Abbey]]]]\n\n===Henry VI===\nFrederick died in 1190 while on the [[Third Crusade]] and was succeeded by his son, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. Elected king even before his father's death, Henry went to [[Rome]] to be crowned emperor. He married Queen [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Sicily]], and deaths in his wife's family gave him claim of succession and possession of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1189 and 1194 respectively, a source of vast wealth. Henry failed to make royal and Imperial succession hereditary, but in 1196 he succeeded in gaining a pledge that his infant son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] would receive the German crown. Faced with difficulties in Italy and confident that he would realize his wishes in Germany at a later date, Henry returned to the south, where it appeared he might unify the peninsula under the Hohenstaufen name. After a series of military victories, however, he fell ill and died of natural causes in Sicily in 1197. His underage son Frederick could only succeed him in Sicily and Malta, while in the Empire the struggle between the House of Staufen and the House of Welf erupted once again.\n\n===Philip of Swabia===\nBecause the election of a three-year-old boy to be German king appeared likely to make orderly rule difficult, the boy's uncle, Duke [[Philip of Swabia]], brother of late Henry VI, was designated to serve in his place. Other factions however favoured a Welf candidate. In 1198, two rival kings were chosen: the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia and the son of the deprived Duke [[Henry the Lion]], the Welf [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]]. A long civil war began; Philip was about to win when he was murdered by the Bavarian [[count palatine]] Otto VIII of [[Wittelsbach]] in 1208. [[Pope Innocent III]] initially had supported the Welfs, but when Otto, now sole elected monarch, moved to appropriate Sicily, Innocent changed sides and accepted young Frederick II{{how|date=July 2014}} and his ally, King [[Philip II of France]], who defeated Otto at the 1214 [[Battle of Bouvines]]. Frederick had returned to Germany in 1212 from Sicily, where he had grown up, and was elected king in 1215. When Otto died in 1218, Fredrick became the undisputed ruler, and in 1220 was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nPhilip changed the coat of arms from a black lion on a gold shield to three leopards,<ref>{{cite book  |last=St\u00e4lin  |first=Paul Friedrich  |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |title=Geschichte W\u00fcrttembergs Erster Band Erste H\u00e4lfte (bis 1268)  |publisher=  |year=1882  |location=Gotha,  |pages=389\u2013393  |url=  |doi=  |id=   |isbn=}}</ref> probably derived from the arms of his Welf rival [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]].\n\n==Ruling in Italy==\nThe conflict between the Staufer dynasty and the [[House of Welf|Welf]] had irrevocably weakened the Imperial authority and the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy#Conquest of Sicily, 1061\u20131091|Norman kingdom of Sicily]] became the base for Staufer rule.\n\n===Frederick II===\n[[Emperor Frederick II]] spent little time in Germany as his main concerns lay in [[Southern Italy]]. He founded the [[University of Naples]] in 1224 to train future state officials and reigned over Germany primarily through the allocation of royal prerogatives, leaving the sovereign authority and imperial estates to the ecclesiastical and secular princes. He made significant concessions to the German nobles, such as those put forth in an imperial statute of 1232, which made princes virtually independent rulers within their territories. These measures favoured the further fragmentation of the Empire.\n[[File:Castel del Monte BW 2016-10-14 12-26-11 r.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frederick's [[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], in [[Andria, Italy|Andria]], Apulia, Italy.]]\nBy the 1226 [[Golden Bull of Rimini]], Frederick had assigned the military order of the [[Teutonic Knights]] to complete the conquest and conversion of the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] lands. A reconciliation with the Welfs took place in 1235, whereby [[Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Otto the Child]], grandson of the late Saxon duke Henry the Lion, was named [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg]]. The power struggle with the popes continued and resulted in Fredrick's [[excommunication]] in 1227. In 1239, [[Pope Gregory IX]] excommunicated Fredrick again, and in 1245 he was condemned as a heretic by a church council. Although Frederick was one of the most energetic, imaginative, and capable rulers of the time, he was not concerned with drawing the disparate forces in Germany together. His legacy was thus that local rulers had more authority after his reign than before it. The clergy also had become more powerful.\n[[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick II with his falcon, from ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', c. 1240, [[Vatican Library]]]]\nBy the time of Frederick's death in 1250, little centralized power remained in Germany. The Great [[Interregnum]], a period in which there were several elected rival kings, none of whom was able to achieve any position of authority, followed the death of Frederick's son King [[Conrad IV of Germany]] in 1254. The German princes vied for individual advantage and managed to strip many powers away from the diminished monarchy. Rather than establish sovereign states however, many nobles tended to look after their families. Their many male heirs created more and smaller estates, and from a largely free class of officials previously formed, many of these assumed or acquired hereditary rights to administrative and legal offices. These trends compounded political fragmentation within Germany. The period was ended in 1273 with the election of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]], a [[Godparent|godson]] of Frederick.\n\n===End of the Staufer dynasty ===\nConrad IV was succeeded as duke of Swabia by his only son, two-year-old [[Conradin]]. By this time, the office of duke of Swabia had been fully subsumed into the office of the king, and without royal authority had become meaningless. In 1261, attempts to elect young Conradin king were unsuccessful. He also had to defend Sicily against an invasion, sponsored by [[Pope Urban IV]] (Jacques Pantal\u00e9on) and [[Pope Clement IV]] (Guy Folques), by [[Charles of Anjou]], a brother of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] king. Charles had been promised by the popes the Kingdom of Sicily, where he would replace the relatives of Frederick II. Charles had defeated Conradin's uncle [[Manfred, King of Sicily]], in the [[Battle of Benevento]] on 26 February 1266. The king himself, refusing to flee, rushed into the midst of his enemies and was killed. Conradin's campaign to retake control ended with his defeat in 1268 at the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]], after which he was handed over to Charles, who had him publicly [[executed]] at [[Naples]]. With Conradin, the direct line of the Dukes of Swabia finally ceased to exist, though most of the later emperors were descended from the Staufer dynasty indirectly.\n\nDuring the political decentralization of the late Staufer period, the population had grown from an estimated 8 million in 1200 to about 14 million in 1300, and the number of towns increased tenfold. The most heavily urbanized areas of Germany were located in the south and the west. Towns often developed a degree of independence, but many were subordinate to local rulers if not [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] to the emperor. Colonization of the east also continued in the thirteenth century, most notably through the efforts of the Teutonic Knights. German merchants also began trading extensively on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]].\n\n==Members of the Hohenstaufen family==\n[[File:Staufen dynasty.JPG|thumb|right|Family tree of the Hohenstaufen emperors including their relation to succeeding dynasties]]\n[[File:Henry 7 of Germany.jpg|thumb|Seal of [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry II of Swabia]] (dated 1216) shows him as a mounted knight with a shield and banner displaying ''three leopards'' (''three lions passant guardant'')as the Hohenstaufen coat of arms; the three lions (later shown just ''passant'') would later become known as the [[Coat of arms of W\u00fcrttemberg|Swabian coat of arms]].]]\n\n===Holy Roman Emperors and Kings of the Romans===\n*[[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], king 1138\u20131152\n*[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], king 1152\u20131190, emperor after 1155\n*[[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], king 1190\u20131197, emperor after 1191\n*[[Philip of Swabia]], king 1198\u20131208\n*[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], king 1208\u20131250, emperor after 1220\n*[[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry (VII)]], king 1220\u20131235 (under his father Emperor Frederick II)\n*[[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]], king 1237\u20131254 (until 1250 under his father Emperor Frederick II)\nThe first ruling Hohenstaufen, Conrad III, like the last one, Conrad IV, was never crowned emperor.

The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]], but has also been influenced by them. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

[[Japanese occupation of Malaya|The subsequent occupation of Malaya]], [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|North Borneo and Sarawak]] from 1942 to 1945 unleashed nationalism. In the Peninsula, the [[Malayan Communist Party]] took up arms against the British. A tough military response was needed to end the insurgency and bring about the establishment of an independent, [[Multiracial|multi-racial]] [[Federation of Malaya]] on 31 August 1957. On 22 July 1963, [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] was granted a [[self-governance]]. The following month on 31 August 1963, both [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] were also granted self-governance and all states formed [[Malaysia]] on 16 September 1963.

Malaya's obvious attractions were its [[tin]] and [[gold]] mines, but British planters soon began to experiment with tropical plantation crops\u2014[[tapioca]], [[uncaria|gambier]], pepper, and coffee. But in 1877 the rubber plant was introduced from [[Brazil]], and [[rubber]] soon became Malaya's staple export, stimulated by booming demand from European industry. Rubber was later joined by [[palm oil]] as an export earner. All these industries required a large and disciplined [[Labor force|labour force]], and the British did not regard the Malays as reliable workers. The solution was the importation of plantation workers from India, mainly [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speakers from [[South India]]. A small group of Malabaris were brought from the current place called Kerala to help with the rubber plantations, resulting in the small Malabari population seen in Malaysia today. The mines, mills and docks also attracted a flood of immigrant workers from southern China. Soon towns like Singapore, Penang, and [[Ipoh]] were majority Chinese, as was [[Kuala Lumpur]], founded as a tin-mining centre in 1857. By 1891, when Malaya's first census was taken, Perak and Selangor, the main tin-mining states, had Chinese majorities.\n\nThe Chinese mostly arrived poor; yet their belief in industriousness and frugality, their emphasis in their children's education and their maintenance of Confucian family hierarchy, as well as their voluntary connection with tightly knit networks of [[Benefit society|mutual aid societies]] (run by \"Hui-Guan\" \u6703\u9928, or non-profit organisations with nominal geographic affiliations from different parts of China) all contributed to their prosperity. In the 1890s [[Yap Ah Loy]], who held the title of Kapitan China of Kuala Lumpur, was the richest man in Malaya, owning a chain of mines, plantations and shops. Malaya's banking and insurance industries were run by the Chinese from the start, and Chinese businesses, usually in partnership with London firms, soon had a stranglehold on the economy. Since the Malay Sultans tended to spend well beyond their means, they were soon indebted to Chinese bankers, and this gave the Chinese political as well as economic leverage. At first the Chinese immigrants were mostly men, and many intended to return home when they had made their fortunes. Many did go home, but many more stayed. At first they married Malay women, producing a community of Sino-Malayans or [[Peranakan|baba]] people, but soon they began importing Chinese brides, establishing permanent communities and building schools and temples.\n\nThe Indians were initially less successful, since unlike the Chinese they came mainly as indentured labourers to work in the rubber plantations, and had few of the economic opportunities that the Chinese had. They were also a less united community, since they were divided between Hindus and Muslims and along lines of language and [[caste]]. An Indian commercial and [[professional class]] emerged during the early 20th century, but the majority of Indians remained poor and uneducated in [[rural ghetto]]s in the rubber-growing areas.\n\nTraditional Malay society had great difficulty coping with both the loss of political sovereignty to the British and of economic power to the Chinese. By the early 20th century it seemed possible that the Malays would become a minority in their own country. The Sultans, who were seen as collaborators with both the British and the Chinese, lost some of their traditional prestige, particularly among the increasing number of Malays with a western education, but the mass of rural Malays continued to revere the Sultans and their prestige was thus an important prop for [[Colonialism|colonial rule]]. A small class of Malay nationalist intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of Islam in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly Christianity. In fact few Malays [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]], although many Chinese did. The northern regions, which were less influenced by western ideas, became strongholds of Islamic conservatism, as they have remained.\n\nThe one consolation to Malay pride was that the British allowed them a virtual monopoly of positions in the police and local [[military unit]]s, as well as a majority of those administrative positions open to non-Europeans. While the Chinese mostly built and paid for their own schools and colleges, importing teachers from China, the colonial government fostered education for Malays, opening [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar|Malay College]] in 1905 and creating the Malay Administrative Service in 1910. (The college was dubbed \u201cBab ud-Darajat\u201d \u2013 the Gateway to High Rank.) [[Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris|A Malay Teachers College]] followed in 1922, and a Malay Women's Training College in 1935. All this reflected the official British policy that Malaya belonged to the Malays, and that the other races were but temporary residents. This view was increasingly out of line with reality, and contained the seeds of much future trouble.\n\nThe Malay teacher's college had lectures and writings that nurtured [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]] and anti-colonialist sentiments. Due to this it is known as the birthplace of [[early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalism]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\">{{cite book|pages=208\u2013209|title=Kurikulum Bersepadu Sekolah Menengah Sejarah Tingkatan 2.|author=Zainal Abidin bin Abdul Wahid |author2=[[Khoo Kay Kim|Khoo, Kay Kim]] |author3=Muhd Yusof bin Ibrahim |author4=Singh, D.S.

It was the first nationalist political organisation in British Malaya, advocating for the union of all Malays regardless of origin, and fighting for Malay rights and against British Imperialism. A specific ideal the KMM held was ''Panji Melayu Raya'', which called for the unification of British Malaya and [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"KBSM F2\"/>\n\nIn the years before [[World War II]], the British were concerned with finding the balance between a centralised state and maintaining the power of the Sultans in Malaya.<ref name=\"History\"/> There were no moves to give Malaya a unitary government, and in fact in 1935 the position of Resident-General of the Federated States was abolished, and its powers decentralised to the individual states. With their usual tendency to racial stereotyping, the British regarded the Malays as amiable but unsophisticated and rather lazy, incapable of self-government, although making good soldiers under British officers. They regarded the Chinese as clever but dangerous\u2014and indeed during the 1920s and 1930s, reflecting events in China, the Chinese Nationalist Party (the [[Kuomintang]]) and the [[Communist Party of China]] built rival clandestine organisations in Malaya, leading to regular disturbances in the Chinese towns. The British saw no way that Malaya's disparate collection of states and races could become a nation, let alone an independent one.\n\n==War and emergency==\n[[File:Tugu Negara.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Tugu Negara]]'', the Malaysian national monument is dedicated to those who fell during World War II and the Malayan Emergency.]]\nAlthough a belligerent as part of the British Empire, Malaya saw little action during [[World War I]], except for the sinking of the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] by the German cruiser [[SMS Emden]] on 28 October 1914 during the [[Battle of Penang]].\n\nThe [[World War II|outbreak of war]] in [[Pacific theatre of World War II|the Pacific]] in December 1941 found the British in Malaya completely unprepared. During the 1930s, anticipating the rising threat of Japanese naval power, they had built a great naval base at Singapore, but never anticipated an invasion of Malaya from the north. Because of the demands of the war in Europe, there was virtually no British air capacity in the Far East. The Japanese were thus able to attack from their bases in [[French Indo-China]] with impunity, and despite stubborn resistance from British, Australian, and Indian forces, they [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|overran Malaya]] in two months. Singapore, with no landward defences, no air cover, and no [[water supply]], was forced to surrender in February 1942, doing irreparable damage to British prestige. British North Borneo and Brunei were also occupied.\n\nThe Japanese had a racial policy just as the British did. They regarded the Malays as a colonial people liberated from British imperialist rule, and fostered a limited form of Malay nationalism, which gained them some degree of collaboration from the Malay civil service and intellectuals.

Chinese businesses were expropriated and Chinese schools either closed or burned down. Not surprisingly the Chinese, led by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP), became the backbone of the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), which with British assistance became the most effective resistance force in the occupied Asian countries.\n\nAlthough the Japanese argued that they supported Malay nationalism, they offended Malay nationalism by allowing their ally [[Thailand]] to re-annex the four northern states, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu that had been surrendered to the British in 1909.

Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.\n\n[[File:Japanese troops mopping up in Kuala Lumpur.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops moving through Kuala Lumpur during their advance through Malaya.]]<!-- Found here: http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&BU=http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/qryPhotoImg.php&TN=Uncat&SN=AUTO9448&SE=565&RN=0&MR=25&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=1&XP=&RF=phoResults&EF=&DF=phoDetails&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=1&ID=&MF=WPENGMSG.INI&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=162462&NR=0&NB=0&SV=0&BG=0&FG=0&QS= -->\n\nIn 1944, the British drew up plans for a [[Malayan Union]], which would turn the Federated and Unfederated Malay States, plus Penang and Malacca (but not Singapore), into a single Crown colony, with a view towards independence. The Bornean territories and Singapore were left out as it was thought this would make union more difficult to achieve.<ref name=\"History\"/> There was however strong opposition from the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] and other minorities.<ref>{{cite news|author=Time magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816440,00.html |title=MALAYA: Token Citizenship |publisher=TIME |date=19 May 1952 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> The British had decided on equality between races as they perceived the Chinese and Indians as more loyal to the British during the war than the Malays.<ref name=\"History\"/> The Sultans, who had initially supported it, backed down and placed themselves at the head of the resistance.\n\nIn 1946, the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) was founded by Malay nationalists led by [[Onn Jaafar|Dato Onn bin Jaafar]], the Chief Minister of Johor.<ref name=\"History\"/> UMNO favoured independence for Malaya, but only if the new state was run exclusively by the Malays. Faced with implacable Malay opposition, the British dropped the plan for equal citizenship. The Malayan Union was thus established in 1946, and was dissolved in 1948 and replaced by the [[Federation of Malaya]], which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection.\n\nMeanwhile, the Communists were moving towards open insurrection. The MPAJA had been disbanded in December 1945, and the MCP organised as a legal political party, but the MPAJA's arms were carefully stored for future use. The MCP policy was for immediate independence with full equality for all races. This meant it recruited very few Malays. The Party's strength was in the Chinese-dominated trade unions, particularly in Singapore, and in the Chinese schools, where the teachers, mostly born in China, saw the [[Communist Party of China]] as the leader of China's [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]]. In March 1947, reflecting the international Communist movement's \u201cturn to left\u201d as the [[Cold War]] set in, the MCP leader [[Lai Tek]] was purged and replaced by the veteran MPAJA guerrilla leader [[Chin Peng]], who turned the party increasingly to [[direct action]]. These rebels, under the leadership of the MCP, launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. In July, following a string of assassinations of plantation managers, the colonial government struck back, declaring a [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]], banning the MCP and arresting hundreds of its militants. The Party retreated to the jungle and formed the [[Malayan Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army]], with about 13,000 men under arms, all Chinese.\n\nThe [[Malayan Emergency]] as it was known, lasted from 1948 to 1960, and involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops in Malaya. The British strategy, which proved ultimately successful, was to isolate the MCP from its support base by a combination of economic and [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Chinese and the resettlement of Chinese squatters into \u201cNew Villages\u201d in \u201cwhite areas\u201d free of MCP influence. In December 1948, 24 villagers were executed by British troops.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/09/malaya-massacre-villagers-coverup</ref> From 1949 the MCP campaign lost momentum and the number of recruits fell sharply. Although the MCP succeeded in assassinating the British [[High Commissioner]], Sir [[Henry Gurney]], in October 1951, this turn to terrorist tactics alienated many moderate Chinese from the Party. The arrival of Lt.-Gen Sir [[Gerald Templer]] as British commander in 1952 was the beginning of the end of the Emergency. Templer invented the techniques of [[counter-insurgency]] warfare in Malaya and applied them ruthlessly. Although the insurgency was defeated Commonwealth troops remained with the backdrop of the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826360,00.html \"Malaya: Siege's End\"], ''Time'', New York, 2 May 1960.</ref> Against this backdrop, [[Hari Merdeka|independence]] for the Federation within the Commonwealth was granted on 31 August 1957,<ref name=\"TIME New Nation\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893616,00.html \"A New Nation\"], ''Time'', New York, 9 September 1957</ref> with [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] as the first prime minister.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n==Towards Malaysia==\n[[File:Dataran Merdeka.jpg|thumb|[[Dataran Merdeka]] (Independence Square) in Kuala Lumpur, where Malaysians celebrate Independence Day on 31 August each year.]]\nChinese reaction against the MCP was shown by the formation of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) in 1949 as a vehicle for moderate Chinese political opinion. Its leader [[Tan Cheng Lock]] favoured a policy of collaboration with UMNO to win Malayan independence on a policy of equal citizenship, but with sufficient concessions to Malay sensitivities to ease nationalist fears. Tan formed a close collaboration with Tunku (Prince) [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Abdul Rahman]], the Chief Minister of [[Kedah]] and from 1951 successor to Datuk Onn as leader of UMNO. Since the British had announced in 1949 that Malaya would soon become independent whether the Malayans liked it or not, both leaders were determined to forge an agreement their communities could live with as a basis for a stable independent state. The UMNO-MCA Alliance, which was later joined by the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), won convincing victories in local and state elections in both Malay and Chinese areas between 1952 and 1955.<ref name=\"Federation of Malaya Agreement\">''See'': {{Wikisource-inline|Federation of Malaya Agreement}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of elected local government was another important step in defeating the Communists. After [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2019s death in 1953, there was a split in the MCP leadership over the wisdom of continuing the armed struggle. Many MCP militants lost heart and went home, and by the time Templer left Malaya in 1954 the Emergency was over, although [[Chin Peng]] led a diehard group that lurked in the inaccessible country along the Thai border for many years.\n\nDuring 1955 and 1956 UMNO, the MCA and the British hammered out a constitutional settlement for a principle of equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaya's head of state]] would be drawn from the ranks of the Malay Sultans, that [[Malay language|Malay]] would be the official language, and that Malay education and [[economic development]] would be promoted and subsidised. In effect this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The difficult issue of who would control the [[Education|education system]] was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.\n\nThis left the unfinished business of the other British-ruled territories in the region. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] the [[Brooke family]] and the British North Borneo Company gave up their control of Sarawak and North Borneo respectively, and these became British Crown Colonies. They were much less economically developed than Malaya, and their local political leaderships were too weak to demand independence. Singapore, with its large Chinese majority, achieved autonomy in 1955, and in 1959 the young socialist leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]] became Prime Minister. The [[Sultan of Brunei]] remained as a British client in his oil-rich enclave. Between 1959 and 1962 the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] orchestrated complex negotiations between these local leaders and the Malayan government.\n\nOn 24 April 1961 Lee Kuan Yew proposed the idea of forming Malaysia during a meeting to Tunku Abdul Rahman, after which Tunku invited Lee to prepare a paper elaborating on this idea. On 9 May, Lee sent the final version of the paper to Tunku and then deputy Malayan Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Abdul Razak]]. There were doubts about the practicality of the idea but Lee assured the Malayan government of continued Malay political dominance in the new federation.

North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore were also granted some autonomy unavailable to the states of Malaya.

In 1963 the total population of Malaysia was about 10 million.\n\n==Challenges of independence==\nAt the time of independence Malaya had great economic advantages. It was among the world's leading producers of three valuable commodities; rubber, tin, and [[palm oil]], and was also a significant iron ore producer. These export industries gave the Malayan government a healthy surplus to invest in industrial development and infrastructure projects. Like other [[Developing country|developing nations]] in the 1950s and 1960s, Malaya (and later Malaysia) placed great stress on state planning, although UMNO was never a socialist party. The First and Second Malayan Plans (1956\u201360 and 1961\u201365 respectively) stimulated economic growth through state investment in industry and repairing infrastructure such as roads and ports, which had been damaged and neglected during the war and the Emergency. The government was keen to reduce Malaya's dependence on commodity exports, which put the country at the mercy of fluctuating prices. The government was also aware that demand for natural rubber was bound to fall as the production and use of [[synthetic rubber]] expanded. Since a third of the Malay workforce worked in the rubber industry it was important to develop alternative sources of employment. Competition for Malaya's rubber markets meant that the profitability of the rubber industry increasingly depended on keeping wages low, which perpetuated rural Malay poverty.\n\n===Foreign objection===\nBoth Indonesia and the Philippines withdrew their ambassadors from Malaya on 15 September 1963, the day before Malaysia's formation. In Jakarta the British and Malayan embassies were stoned, and the British consulate in [[Medan]] was ransacked with Malaya's consul taking refuge in the US consulate.

This stabilised the demographic situation and ended the prospect of the Malays becoming a minority in their own country. At the time of independence in 1957, Malays comprised 55% of the population, Chinese 35% and Indians 10%.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This balance was altered by the inclusion of the majority-Chinese Singapore, upsetting many Malays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The federation increased the Chinese proportion to close to 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were nervous about the possible appeal of Lee's [[People's Action Party]] (then seen as a radical socialist party) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there.

The Malays felt unhappy with the wealth of the Chinese community, even after the expulsion of Singapore. Malay political movements emerged based around this.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> However, since there was no effective opposition party, these issues were contested mainly within the [[coalition government]], which won all but one seat in the first post-independence Malayan Parliament. The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end. The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community's interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO. This produced a crisis in the MCA in 1959, in which a more assertive leadership under [[Lim Chong Eu]] defied UMNO over the education issue, only to be forced to back down when Tunku Abdul Rahman threatened to break up the coalition.\n\nThe Education Act of 1961 put UMNO's victory on the education issue into legislative form. Henceforward Malay and English would be the only teaching languages in secondary schools, and state primary schools would teach in Malay only. Although the Chinese and Indian communities could maintain their own Chinese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-language primary schools, all their students were required to learn Malay, and to study an agreed \"Malayan curriculum\". Most importantly, the entry exam to the [[University of Malaya]] (which moved from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in 1963) would be conducted in Malay, even though most teaching at the university was in English until the 1970s. This had the effect of excluding many Chinese students. At the same time Malay schools were heavily subsidised, and Malays were given preferential treatment. This obvious defeat for the MCA greatly weakened its support in the Chinese community.\n\nAs in education, the UMNO government's unspoken agenda in the field of economic development aimed to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays. The two Malayan Plans and the First Malaysian Plan (1966\u20131970) directed resources heavily into developments which would benefit the rural Malay community, such as village schools, rural roads, clinics, and irrigation projects. Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and to increase their incomes. The [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (FELDA) helped many Malays to buy farms or to upgrade ones they already owned. The state also provided a range of incentives and low-interest loans to help Malays start [[business]]es, and government tendering systematically favoured Malay companies, leading many Chinese-owned businesses to \"Malayanise\" their management. All this certainly tended to reduce to gap between Chinese and Malay standards of living, although some{{which|date=March 2016}} argued that this would have happened anyway as Malaysia's trade and general prosperity increased.\n\n==The crisis of 1969==\n{{Main|13 May incident}}\nThe collaboration of the MCA and the MIC in these policies weakened their hold on the Chinese and Indian electorates. At the same time, the effects of the government's [[affirmative action]] policies of the 1950s and 1960s had been to create a discontented class of educated but underemployed Malays. This was a dangerous combination, and led to the formation of a new party, the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Malaysian People's Movement]] (Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia) in 1968. Gerakan was a deliberately non-communal party, bringing in Malay trade unionists and intellectuals as well as Chinese and Indian leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the same time, an [[Islamism|Islamist]] party, the [[Islamic Party of Malaysia]] (PAS) and a Chinese socialist party, the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), gained increasing support, at the expense of UMNO and the MCA respectively.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nAt the May 1969 federal elections, the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance polled only 48% of the vote, although it retained a majority in the legislature. The MCA lost most of the Chinese-majority seats to Gerakan or DAP candidates. The victorious opposition celebrated by holding a motorcade on the main streets of Kuala Lumpur with supporters holding up brooms as a signal of its intention to make sweeping changes.  Fear of what the changes might mean for them (as much of the country's businesses were Chinese-owned), a Malay backlash resulted, leading rapidly to [[13 May incident|riots and inter-communal violence]] in which about 6,000 Chinese homes and businesses were burned and at least 184 people were killed.<ref name=\"TIME Art\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828327,00.html |title=Malaysia: The Art of Dispelling Anxiety |publisher=Time magazine |date=27 August 1965 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Race war\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900859,00.html |title=Race War in Malaysia |publisher=Time magazine |date=23 May 1969 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> The government declared a state of emergency, and a National Operations Council, headed by Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]], took power from the government of Tunku Abdul Rahman, who, in September 1970, was forced to retire in favour of Abdul Razak. It consisted of nine members, mostly Malay, and wielded full political and military power.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUsing the Emergency-era [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), the new government suspended Parliament and political parties, imposed [[Censorship|press censorship]] and placed severe restrictions on political activity. The ISA gave the government power to intern any person indefinitely without trial. These powers were widely used to silence the government's critics, and have never been repealed. The Constitution was changed to make illegal any criticism, even in Parliament, of the Malaysian monarchy, the special position of Malays in the country, or the status of Malay as the national language.\n\nIn 1971 Parliament reconvened, and a new government coalition, the [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]] (Barisan Nasional), was formed in 1973 to replace the Alliance party.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The coalition consisted of UMNO, the MCA, the MIC, Gerakan, [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|PPP]], and regional parties in Sabah and Sarawak. The PAS also joined the Front but was expelled in 1977. The DAP was left outside as the only significant opposition party. Abdul Razak held office until his death in 1976. He was succeeded by Datuk [[Hussein Onn]], the son of UMNO's founder Onn Jaafar, and then by Tun [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had been Education Minister since 1981, and who held power for 22 years. During these years policies were put in place which led to the rapid transformation of Malaysia's economy and society, such as the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]], which was intended to increase proportionally the share of the economic \"pie\" of the [[bumiputra]]s as compared to other ethnic groups\u2014was launched by Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]]. Malaysia has since maintained a delicate ethno-political balance, with a system of government that has attempted to combine overall economic development with political and economic policies that promote equitable participation of all races.<ref name=\"New Economic Policy\">{{cite web|author=[[Jomo Kwame Sundaram]], [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development|UNRISD]] |url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpPublications)/A20E9AD6E5BA919780256B6D0057896B?OpenDocument&panel=seriespapers |title=The New Economic Policy and Interethnic Relations in Malaysia |publisher=UNRISD |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Malaysia==\n{{See also|Human rights in Malaysia|Freedom of religion in Malaysia}}\n[[File:KualaLumpurAbdulSamadBldg.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street scene; a large fountain visible in the right foreground, a row of palm trees stretching away to the left, and in the centre of the image, across the street, a large white and beige stone building, with a tall domed central tower and two smaller domed towers to the right and left.|Kuala Lumpur, a blend of old and new.]]\nIn 1970 three quarters of Malaysians living below the poverty line were Malays, the majority of Malays were still rural workers, and Malays were still largely excluded from the modern economy. The government's response was the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] of 1971, which was to be implemented through a series of four five-year plans from 1971 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The plan had two objectives: the elimination of poverty, particularly rural poverty, and the elimination of the identification between race and prosperity.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This latter policy was understood to mean a decisive shift in economic power from the Chinese to the Malays,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who until then made up only 5% of the professional class.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nPoverty was tackled through an [[agricultural policy]] which resettled 250,000 Malays on newly cleared farmland, more investment in [[rural infrastructure]], and the creation of [[free trade zone]]s in rural areas to create new manufacturing jobs. Little was done to improve the living standards of the low-paid workers in plantation agriculture, although this group steadily declined as a proportion of the workforce. By 1990 the poorest parts of Malaysia were rural Sabah and Sarawak, which lagged significantly behind the rest of the country. During the 1970s and \u201880s rural poverty did decline, particularly in the Malayan Peninsula, but critics of the government's policy contend that this was mainly due to the growth of overall national prosperity (due in large part to the discovery of important oil and gas reserves) and migration of rural people to the cities rather than to state intervention. These years saw rapid growth in Malaysian cities, particularly Kuala Lumpur, which became a magnet for immigration both from rural Malaya and from poorer neighbours such as Indonesia, [[Bangladesh]], Thailand and the Philippines. Urban poverty became a problem for the first time, with [[shanty town]]s growing up around the cities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe second arm of government policy, driven mainly by Mahathir first as Education Minister and then as Prime Minister, was the transfer of economic power to the Malays. Mahathir greatly expanded the number of secondary schools and universities throughout the country, and enforced the policy of teaching in Malay rather than English. This had the effect of creating a large new Malay professional class. It also created an unofficial barrier against Chinese access to higher education, since few Chinese are sufficiently fluent in [[Malay language|Malay]] to study at Malay-language universities. Chinese families therefore sent their children to universities in Singapore, Australia, Britain or the United States \u2013 by 2000, for example, 60,000 Malaysians held degrees from Australian universities. This had the [[unintended consequence]] of exposing large numbers of Malaysians to life in [[Western world|Western countries]], creating a new source of discontent. Mahathir also greatly expanded educational opportunities for Malay women \u2013 by 2000 half of all university students were women.\n\n[[File:KLCC twin towers2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Petronas Twin Towers]], Kuala Lumpur, the tallest building in Southeast Asia.]]\nTo find jobs for all these new Malay graduates, the government created several agencies for intervention in the economy. The most important of these were PERNAS (National Corporation Ltd.), [[PETRONAS]] (National Petroleum Ltd.), and HICOM (Heavy Industry Corporation of Malaysia), which not only directly employed many Malays but also invested in growing areas of the economy to create new technical and administrative jobs which were preferentially allocated to Malays. As a result, the share of Malay equity in the economy rose from 1.5% in 1969 to 20.3% in 1990, and the percentage of businesses of all kinds owned by Malays rose from 39 percent to 68 percent. This latter figure was deceptive because many businesses that appeared to be Malay-owned were still indirectly controlled by Chinese, but there is no doubt that the Malay share of the economy considerably increased. The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.\n\nMalaysia's rapid [[economic progress]] since 1970, which was only temporarily disrupted by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, has not been matched by change in [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian politics]]. The repressive measures passed in 1970 remain in place. Malaysia has had regular elections since 1974, and although campaigning is reasonably free at election time, it is in effect a [[one-party state]], with the UMNO-controlled National Front usually winning nearly all the seats, while the DAP wins some Chinese urban seats and the PAS some rural Malay ones. Since the DAP and the PAS have diametrically opposed policies, they have been unable to form an effective opposition coalition. There is almost no criticism of the government in the media and public protest remains severely restricted. The ISA continues to be used to silence dissidents, and the members of the UMNO [[youth movement]] are deployed to physically intimidate opponents.\n\n===Mahathir administration===\n[[File:Mahathir Mohamad addressing the United Nations General Assembly (September 25 2003).jpg|right|200px|thumb|alt=A photo showing former Prime Minister Mahatir bin Mohamad standing with head down and surrounded by government officials at the celebration of the 50th independence day.|[[Mahathir Mohamad]] was the leading force in making Malaysia into a major industrial power.]]\nThe restoration of democracy after the 1969 crisis caused disputes in the UMNO, a struggle of power which increased after the death of [[Tun Abdul Razak]]. The ailing Datuk Hussein Bin Onn replaced him, but the fight for control shifted to appointing the deputy prime minister. Mahathir Mohamad was chosen, an advocate of [[Bumiputra]] who also tried to benefit the other ethnic communities.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUnder the premiership of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], Malaysia experienced economic growth from the 1980s, a 1985\u201386 property market depression,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Property: A Steep Climb with a Gentle Descent|journal=Euromoney|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor|date=August 1992}}</ref> and returned to growth through to the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |publisher=Time New York |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}</ref> Mahathir increased privatisation and introduced the New Development Policy (NDP), designed to increase economic wealth for all Malaysians, rather than just Malays.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The period saw a shift from an agriculture-based economy to one based on manufacturing and industry in areas such as computers and consumer electronics. It was during this period, too, that the physical landscape of Malaysia changed with the emergence of numerous mega-projects. Notable amongst these projects were the construction of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] (at the time the tallest building in the world, and, as of 2016, still the tallest twin building), [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA), the [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]], the [[Sepang International Circuit]], the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), the Bakun hydroelectric dam, and [[Putrajaya]], the new federal administrative capital.\n\nUnder [[Mahathir Mohamad]]\u2019s long Prime Ministership (1981\u20132003), Malaysia's [[political culture]] became increasingly centralised and authoritarian, due to Mahathir's belief that the multiethnic Malaysia could only remain stable through controlled democracy. In 1986\u201387, he faced leadership challenges among his own party. There were also attacks by the government on several [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGO) which were critical of various government policies.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSBZ7GffengC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Social Movement Malaysia|editor1=Saliha Hassan |editor2=Meredith Weiss |publisher=Routledge |year= 2002 |page=36 |isbn=978-0700716463 }}</ref> There were also issues such the questioning by MCA's [[Lee Kim Sai]] over the use of the term ''[[pendatang]]'' (immigrants) that was seen as challenging Malay's [[bumiputra]] status,<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Lee Kam Hing |page=516 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}</ref>  as well as rumours of forced conversion to or from Islam.<ref name=protest>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u87MgDuMjbkC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Protest and Possibilities: Civil Society and Coalitions for Political Change in Malaysia |author = Meredith Leigh Weiss |page=124 |publisher=Stanford University Press|year= 2005 |isbn=978-0804752954 }}</ref> Mahathir initiated a crackdown on opposition dissidents with the use of the Internal Security Act named [[Operation Lalang]]. The Internal Security Act was invoked in October 1987 arresting 106 people, including opposition leaders. The head of the judiciary and five members of the supreme court who had questioned his use of the ISA were also arrested, and a clampdown on Malaysia's press occurred.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nThis culminated in the dismissal and imprisonment on unsubstantiated charges of the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1997 after an internal dispute within the government. The complicity of the judiciary in this piece of persecution was seen as a particularly clear sign of the decline of Malaysian democracy. The Anwar affair led to the formation of a new party, the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]], or Keadilan, led by Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]]. At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front ([[Barisan Alternatif]]). The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, [[Lim Kit Siang]]. Wan Azizah won her husband's former constituency in Penang but otherwise Keadilan made little impact.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Malaysia was shaken by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian financial crisis]], which damaged Malaysia's assembly line-based economy. Mahathir combated it initially with IMF approved policies. However, the devaluation of the [[Malaysian Ringgit|Ringgit]] and the deepening recession caused him to create his own programme, based on protecting Malaysia from foreign investors and reinvigorating the economy through construction projects and the lowering of interest rates. The policies caused Malaysia's economy to rebound by 2002, but brought disagreement between Mahathir and his deputy, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who backed the IMF policies.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> This led to the sacking of the Anwar, causing political unrest.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1998/980914/cover1.html |title=He's the Boss |publisher=Time Asia Hong Kong |date=14 September 1998 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> Anwar was arrested and banned from politics on what are considered trumped up charges.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In 2003 Mahathir, Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, voluntarily retired in favour of his new deputy, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]].<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> In November 2007 two anti-government rallies occurred, precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the election system that heavily favoured the ruling political party, [[National Front (Malaysia)|National Front]], which has been in power since Malaya achieved independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=863&Itemid=31 |title=Malaysian Petitioners Defy Police |publisher=Asia Sentinel |accessdate=9 July 2009 |last=Imtiaz Shah Yacob |first=Imran}}</ref>\n\n===Badawi administration===\nDato Seri [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] freed Anwar,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> which was seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 election]], the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory,<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> virtually wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory was seen as the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia's economy, which has lifted the living standards of most Malaysians to almost [[first world]] standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully [[developed country]] by 2020 as expressed in ''[[Wawasan 2020]]''. It leaves unanswered, however, the question of when and how Malaysia will acquire a first world [[political system]] (a multi-party democracy, a free press, an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]] and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.\n\nIn November 2007, Malaysia was rocked by two anti-government rallies. The 2007 [[Bersih 2.0 rally|Bersih Rally]] which was attended by 40,000 people was held in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007, to campaign for [[electoral reform]]. It was precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the Malaysian [[Voting system|election system]] that heavily favour the ruling political party, Barisan Nasional, which has been in power since Malaysia achieved its independence in 1957.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=863&Itemid=31\n|title=Asia Sentinel&nbsp;\u2013 Malaysian Petitioners Defy Police\n|publisher=[[Asia Sentinel]]\n|accessdate=9 July 2009\n|last=Imtiaz Shah Yacob\n|first=Imran\n}}\n</ref> Another rally was held on 25 November 2007, in Kuala Lumpur led by [[HINDRAF]].
