It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism. Cell walls are present in most [[prokaryotes]] (except [[mycoplasma]] bacteria), in [[algae]], [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] but rarely in other [[eukaryote]]s including animals.  A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing [[Cytolysis|over-expansion]] of the cell when water enters.\n\nThe composition of cell walls varies between species and may depend on cell type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] is composed of the polysaccharides [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]]s and [[pectin]]. Often, other polymers such as [[lignin]], [[suberin]] or [[cutin]] are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as [[carrageenan]] and [[agar]] that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of [[peptidoglycan]]. The cell walls of [[archaea]] have various compositions, and may be formed of [[glycoprotein]] [[S-layer]]s, [[pseudopeptidoglycan]], or [[polysaccharide]]s. Fungi possess cell walls made of the [[N-acetylglucosamine]] polymer [[chitin]]. Unusually, [[diatom]]s have a cell wall composed of [[biogenic silica]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Ryan D. |last2=Wright |first2=David W. |chapter=Biomineralization: Peptide-Mediated Synthesis of Materials| editor-last1=Lukehart | editor-first1=C.M. | editor-last2=Scott | editor-first2=R.A. | title=Nanomaterials: Inorganic and Bioinorganic Perspectives | publisher=Wiley | series=EIC Books | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-118-62522-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-CKE8_Bi0C&pg=RA2-PT52 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nA plant cell wall was first observed and named (simply as a \"wall\") by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665.<ref>Hooke, R. 1665.

[[Hugo von Mohl]] (1853, 1858) advocated the idea that the cell wall grows by apposition. [[Carl N\u00e4geli]] (1858, 1862, 1863) believed that the growth of the wall in thickness and in area was due to a process termed intussusception. Each theory was improved in the following decades: the apposition (or lamination) theory by [[Eduard Strasburger]] (1882, 1889), and the intussusception theory by [[Julius Wiesner]] (1886).<ref>Sharp, L.

''Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze''.

They may give cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical stress. In multicellular organisms, they permit the organism to build and hold a definite shape ([[morphogenesis]]). Cell walls also limit the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell. They further permit the creation of stable [[osmotic]] environments by preventing [[Cytolysis|osmotic lysis]] and helping to retain water. Their composition, properties, and form may change during the [[cell cycle]] and depend on growth conditions.\n\n===Rigidity of cell walls===\nIn most cells, the cell wall is flexible, meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape, but has considerable [[tensile strength]]. The apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls, but is not due to the walls' stiffness. Hydraulic [[turgor pressure]] creates this rigidity, along with the wall structure. The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt, so that the stems and leaves begin to droop, or in [[seaweed]]s that bend in [[Ocean current|water current]]s. As John Howland explains\n\n{{quote|Think of the cell wall as a wicker basket in which a balloon has been inflated so that it exerts pressure from the inside.  Such a basket is very rigid and resistant to mechanical damage.  Thus does the prokaryote cell (and eukaryotic cell that possesses a cell wall) gain strength from a flexible plasma membrane pressing against a rigid cell wall.<ref name=\"Howland 2000\">{{cite book| last = Howland | first = John L. | year = 2000 | title = The Surprising Archaea: Discovering Another Domain of Life | pages = 69\u201371 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-511183-4}}</ref>}}\n\nThe apparent rigidity of the cell wall thus results from inflation of the cell contained within. This [[turgor pressure|inflation]] is a result of the [[osmosis|passive uptake of water]].\n\nIn plants, a '''secondary cell wall''' is a thicker additional layer of cellulose which increases wall rigidity. Additional layers may be formed by [[lignin]] in [[xylem]] cell walls, or [[suberin]] in [[cork cambium|cork]] cell walls. These compounds are [[Structural rigidity|rigid]] and [[waterproof]], making the secondary wall stiff. Both [[wood]] and [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cells of [[tree]]s have secondary walls. Other parts of plants such as the [[petiole (botany)|leaf stalk]] may acquire similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces.\n\n===Permeability===\nThe primary cell wall of most [[plant cell]]s is freely permeable to small molecules including small proteins, with size exclusion estimated to be 30-60 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  The pH is an important factor governing the transport of molecules through cell walls.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]], contain [[hydroxyproline]] (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners.

This type of wall is found in some [[methanogen]]s, such as ''[[Methanobacterium]]'' and ''[[Methanothermus]]''.<ref name=\"Brock 1994\">[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock, Thomas D.]], Michael T. Madigan, John M. Martinko, & Jack Parker. (1994) ''Biology of Microorganisms'', 7th ed., pages 818-819, 824 (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall). {{ISBN|0-13-042169-3}}.</ref>  While the overall structure of archaeal ''pseudo''peptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial peptidoglycan, there are a number of significant chemical differences. Like the peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls, pseudopeptidoglycan consists of [[polymer]] chains of [[glycan]] cross-linked by short [[peptide]] connections.  However, unlike peptidoglycan, the sugar [[N-Acetylmuramic acid|N-acetylmuramic acid]] is replaced by [[N-Acetyltalosaminuronic acid|N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid]],<ref name=\"White 1995\" /> and the two sugars are bonded with a ''\u03b2'',1-3 glycosidic linkage instead of  ''\u03b2'',1-4.  Additionally, the cross-linking peptides are [[L-amino acid]]s rather than D-amino acids as they are in bacteria.<ref name=\"Brock 1994\" />\n\nA second type of archaeal cell wall is found in ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' and ''[[Halococcus]]''.  This type of cell wall is composed entirely of a thick layer of [[polysaccharide]]s, which may be [[sulfate]]d in the case of ''Halococcus''.<ref name=\"Brock 1994\" />  Structure in this type of wall is complex and not fully investigated.\n\nA third type of wall among the [[Archaea]] consists of [[glycoprotein]], and occurs in the [[hyperthermophile]]s, ''[[Halobacterium]]'', and some [[methanogen]]s.  In ''Halobacterium'', the [[protein]]s in the wall have a high content of [[acid]]ic [[amino acid]]s, giving the wall an overall negative charge.  The result is an unstable structure that is stabilized by the presence of large quantities of positive [[sodium]] [[ion]]s that [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the charge.<ref name=\"Brock 1994\" />  Consequently, ''Halobacterium'' thrives only under conditions with high [[salinity]].\n\nIn other Archaea, such as ''[[Methanomicrobium]]'' and ''[[Desulfurococcus]]'', the wall may be composed only of surface-layer [[protein]]s,<ref name=\"Howland 2000\"/> known as an ''[[S-layer]]''. S-layers are common in bacteria, where they serve as either the sole cell-wall component or an outer layer in conjunction with [[polysaccharides]]. Most Archaea are Gram-negative, though at least one Gram-positive member is known.<ref name=\"Howland 2000\" />\n\n==Other cell coverings==\n\nMany [[protist]]s and [[bacteria]] produce other cell surface structures apart from cell walls, external ([[extracellular matrix]]) or internal.<ref>Preisig, H.R.

Sometimes these theories overlapped with [[mythology]] and were personified in deities.  Some of these interpretations included [[atomism]] (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter) but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces without changing their nature.\n\nWhile the classification of the material world in ancient [[Mah\u0101bh\u016bta|Indian]], [[Ancient Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greece]] into Air, Earth, Fire and Water was more philosophical, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] medieval middle eastern scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials.<ref name=Jim>''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009</ref> In Europe, the Ancient Greek system of [[Aristotle]] evolved slightly into the [[#Medieval classic element systems|medieval system]], which for the first time in Europe became subject to experimental verification in the 1600s, during the [[Scientific Revolution]].\n\nModern science does not support the classical elements as the material basis of the physical world.  [[Atomic theory]] classifies atoms into more than a hundred [[chemical element]]s such as [[oxygen]], [[iron]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].  These elements form [[chemical compound]]s and [[mixtures]], and under different temperatures and pressures, these substances can adopt different [[states of matter]].  The most commonly observed states of [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] share many attributes with the classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively, but these states are due to similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels, and not due to containing a certain type of atom or a certain type of substance.\n\n==Ancient times==\n{{anchor|Ancient classic element systems}}\nIn classical thought, the four elements [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] as proposed by [[Empedocles]] frequently occur; [[Aristotle]] added a fifth element, [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]; it has been called [[akasha]] in India and quintessence in Europe.\n\nThe concept of the five elements formed a basis of analysis in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Hinduism, particularly in an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] context, the four states-of-matter describe matter, and a fifth element describes that which was beyond the material world. Similar lists existed in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In Buddhism the four great elements, to which two others are sometimes added, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of [[sensory experience]].\n\n===Cosmic elements in Babylonia===\nIn [[Babylonian mythology]], the cosmogony called ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', a text written between the 18th and 16th centuries BC, involves four gods that we might see as personified cosmic elements: sea, earth, sky, wind.

In view of the durability of meteoric iron, metal came to be associated with the [[aether (classical element)|aether]], which is sometimes conflated with [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[pneuma]], as both terms originally referred to air (the former being higher, brighter, more fiery or celestial and the latter being merely warmer, and thus [[vitalism|vital]] or [[abiogenesis|biogenetic]]). In [[Taoism]], ''[[qi]]'' functions similarly to pneuma in a prime matter (a basic principle of energetic transformation) that accounts for both biological and inanimate phenomena.\n\nIn Chinese philosophy the universe consists of heaven and earth. The five major [[planet]]s are associated with and even named after the elements: [[Jupiter]] \u6728\u661f is Wood ([[wikt:\u6728#Han character|\u6728]]), [[Mars]] \u706b\u661f is Fire ([[wikt:\u706b#Han character|\u706b]]), [[Saturn]] \u571f\u661f is Earth ([[wikt:\u571f#Han character|\u571f]]), [[Venus]] \u91d1\u661f is Metal ([[wikt:\u91d1#Han character|\u91d1]]), and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] \u6c34\u661f is Water ([[wikt:\u6c34#Han character|\u6c34]]).

Yin, Yang, and the five elements are associated with themes in the [[I Ching]], the oldest of Chinese classical texts which describes an ancient system of [[cosmology]] and [[philosophy]]. The five elements also play an important part in [[Chinese astrology]] and the Chinese form of [[geomancy]] known as [[Feng shui]].\n\nThe doctrine of five phases describes two cycles of balance, a generating or creation (\u751f, sh\u0113ng) cycle and an overcoming or destruction (\u514b/\u524b, k\u00e8) cycle of interactions between the phases.\n\n''Generating''\n* Wood feeds fire;\n* Fire creates earth (ash);\n* Earth bears metal;\n* Metal collects water;\n* Water nourishes wood.\n\n''Overcoming''\n* Wood parts earth;\n* Earth absorbs water;\n* Water quenches fire;\n* Fire melts metal;\n* Metal chops wood.\n\nThere are also two cycles of imbalance, an overacting cycle (cheng) and an insulting cycle (wu).\n\n===Greece===\n{{anchor|Classical elements in Greece}}<!-- This section is linked from [[Democritus]] -->\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|Aristotelian elements and qualities\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffffff; text-align:center;\" |\n[[File:Four elements representation.svg|center|200px|Four classical elements]]\n{{clear}}\n''Empedoclean elements''\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|20px]] [[Fire (classical element)|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire]] {{\u00b7}}\n[[File:Alchemy air symbol.svg|20px]] [[Air (classical element)|air&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]] <br />\n[[File:Alchemy water symbol.svg|20px]] [[Water (classical element)|water]] {{\u00b7}}\n[[File:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|20px]] [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]\n\n|}\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] belief in five basic elements, these being earth (\u03b3\u1fc6  ''ge''), water (\u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 ''hudor''), air (\u1f00\u03ae\u03c1 ''aer''), fire (\u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1 ''pur'') and aether (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1 ''aither''), dates from pre-Socratic times and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], deeply influencing [[Europe]]an thought and culture.

As described in this book:\n\n<blockquote>And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, some are made friends with ''fire'', and some with ''water'', some with ''air'', and some with ''earth'', and some with two or three of these, and some with all. And, on the contrary, again some are made enemies of fire, and some of water, some of earth, and some of air, and some of two of them, and some of three, and some of all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth; all swimming things love water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies' outer envelope. Each [[soul]], accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Galen]], these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] in describing the [[human body]] with an association with the [[Humorism|four humours]]: yellow [[bile]] (fire), [[Melancholia|black bile]] (earth), [[blood]] (air), and [[phlegm]] (water).

In addition, the elements are correlated to different emotions, temperaments, directions, colors, tastes, body types, illnesses, thinking styles, and character.  From the five elements arise the five senses and the five fields of sensory experience; the five negative emotions and the five wisdoms; and the five extensions of the body.  They are the five primary ''pranas'' or vital energies.  They are the constituents of every physical, sensual, mental, and spiritual phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light |page=1 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |isbn=1-55939-176-6 |year=2002}}</ref>}}\n\nThe names of the elements are analogous to categorised experiential sensations of the natural world.

In one Greek myth, [[Prometheus]] stole ''fire'' from the gods to protect the otherwise helpless humans, but was punished for this charity.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~Mclennan/BA/AGEDE/Fire.html|title=The Elements: Fire|author=|website=Cs.utk.edu|accessdate=2007-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029052110/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~Mclennan/BA/AGEDE/Fire.html|archivedate=2007-10-29|df=}}</ref>\n\nFire was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom sought to reduce the [[cosmos]], or its creation, to a single substance. [[Heraclitus]] {{nowrap|(c. 535 BCE \u2013}} {{nowrap|c. 475 BCE)}} considered ''fire'' to be the most fundamental of all elements. He believed fire gave rise to the other three elements: \"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.\"<ref name=DK90>[[Diels-Kranz]] B90 (Freeman [1948] 1970, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ASijqFryr5IC&lpg=PP45&pg=PA45 p. 45]).</ref> He had a reputation for obscure philosophical principles and for speaking in riddles.

This is a concept that anticipates both the four [[classical elements]] of [[Empedocles]] and [[Aristotle]]'s transmutation of the four elements into one another.\n<blockquote>This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.<ref name=DK30>[[Diels-Kranz]] B30 (Freeman [1948] 1970, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ASijqFryr5IC&lpg=PP40&pg=PA40 p. 40]).</ref></blockquote> \n[[Heraclitus]] regarded the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as being a mixture of fire and water, with fire being the more [[Nobility|noble]] part and water the ignoble aspect. He believed the goal of the soul is to be rid of water and become pure fire: the dry soul is the best and it is worldly pleasures that make the soul \"moist\".<ref name=\"russell\">[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]''</ref> He was known as the \"weeping philosopher\" and died of [[hydropsy]], a swelling due to abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin.\n\nHowever, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 -}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}}, is best known for having selected all elements as his ''archai'' and by the time of [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 -}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}}, the four Empedoclian elements were well established. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato's major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] he associated with fire was the [[tetrahedron]] which is formed from four triangles and contains the least volume with the greatest surface area. This also makes fire the element with the smallest number of sides, and Plato regarded it as appropriate for the heat of fire, which he felt is sharp and stabbing, (like one of the points of a tetrahedron).<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22\u201323; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato\u2019s Universe'', pp. 66\u201382.</ref>\n\nPlato\u2019s student [[Aristotle]] {{nowrap|(384 -}} {{nowrap|322 BCE)}} did not maintain his former teacher's geometric view of the elements, but rather preferred a somewhat more naturalistic explanation for the elements based on their traditional qualities. Fire the hot and dry element, like the other elements, was an abstract principle and not identical with the normal solids, liquids and combustion phenomena we experience:\n<blockquote> What we commonly call fire. It is not really fire, for fire is an excess of heat and a sort of ebullition; but in reality, of what we call air, the part surrounding the earth is moist and warm, because it contains both vapour and a dry exhalation from the earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book1.html |title=Meteorology, by Aristotle (Book I, Section 3)|website=Ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Aristotle, the four elements rise or fall toward their natural place in concentric layers surrounding the center of the earth and form the terrestrial or [[sublunary sphere]]s.<ref>[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nIn [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. Yellow [[bile]] was the humor identified with fire, since both were hot and dry. Other things associated with fire and yellow bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of summer, since it increased the qualities of heat and aridity; the choleric temperament (of a person dominated by the yellow bile humour); the [[Masculinity|masculine]]; and the eastern point of the compass.\n\n[[Image:Alchemy fire symbol.svg|thumb|100px|Alchemical symbol for fire]]\n\nIn [[alchemy]] the [[chemical element]] of [[sulfur]] was often associated with fire and its [[alchemical symbol]] and its symbol was an upward-pointing triangle. In alchemic tradition, metals are incubated by fire in the womb of the Earth and alchemists only accelerate their development.<ref name=\"F\"/>\n\n==Indian tradition==\n{{Main|Agni}}\n'''Agni''' is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]].  The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for fire (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' (the root of English ''ignite''), Russian ''\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c'' (fire), pronounced ''agon''. Agni has three forms: fire, lightning and the sun.\n\nAgni is one of the most important of the Vedic gods. He is the god of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices. The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, yet he is also immortal. In Indian tradition Fire is also linked to [[Surya]] or the Sun and [[Mangala]] or [[Mars]], and with the south-east direction.\n\n==Ceremonial magic==\nFire and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system.  Philosophus (4=7) is the elemental grade attributed to fire; this grade is also attributed to the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] Sephirah [[Netzach]] and the planet [[Venus]].<ref>Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154\u201365.</ref> The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of fire is the Wand.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn''</ref> Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of fire is [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], the angel is Aral, the ruler is Seraph, the king is Djin, and the fire [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]].<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.</ref> Fire is considered to be active; it is represented by the symbol for [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] and it is referred to the lower right point of the pentacle in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentacle.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280\u2013286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206\u2013209.</ref> Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.\n\n==Tarot==\nFire in Tarot symbolizes conversion or passion.  Many references to fire in tarot are related to the usage of fire in the practice of [[alchemy]], in which the application of fire is a prime method of conversion, and everything that touches fire is changed, often beyond recognition. The symbol of fire was a cue pointing towards transformation, the chemical variant being the symbol delta, which is also the classical symbol for fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarotteachings.com/fire-symbolism-in-tarot.html|title=Fire Symbolism in Tarot|website=Taroteachings.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref> Conversion symbolized can be good, for example, refining raw crudities to gold, as seen in The Devil. Conversion can also be bad, as in The Tower, symbolizing a downfall due to anger. Fire is associated with the [[Suit of wands|suit of rods/wands]], and as such, represents passion from inspiration. As an element, fire has mixed symbolism because it represents energy, which can be helpful when controlled, but volatile if left unchecked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corax.com/tarot/index.html?element-of-fire|title=Raven's Tarot Site|website=Corax.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Modern witchcraft==\nFire is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n traditions influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic, and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism, which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.<ref>Hutton, pp. 216\u201323; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fuego en la ceremonia de la cena del solsticio de invierno (Muy Resp.'.

However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four ''archai'' for his four roots: Air, [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[water (classical element)|water]], and [[earth (classical element)|earth]]. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name [[Hera]], [[Hades|Aidoneus]] or even [[Zeus]]. Empedocles\u2019 roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy.<ref>Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 138\u201346.

In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with air is the [[octahedron]] which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate.  He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22\u201323; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato\u2019s Universe'', pp. 66\u201382.</ref>\n\nPlato's student [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the [[sublunary sphere]]. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed [[celestial spheres]].<ref>[[G. E. R.

[[Blood]] was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of [[spring (season)|spring]], since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); [[hermaphrodite]] (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.<ref>Londa Schiebinger, p. 162.</ref>\n\nThe [[alchemical symbol]] for air is an upward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.\n\n==Modern reception==\nThe [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings.<ref>Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154\u201365.</ref> The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149\u201353.</ref> Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings.

As the words for air (V\u0101yu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the ''[[Classical elements#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamah\u0101bhuta]]'' the \"five great elements\" in Hinduism. \n\nAir is not one of the traditional five [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical elements]].  Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of ''Qi'' or ''chi'' is believed to be close to that of air. '''[[Qi]]''' ({{IPA-cmn|t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee}}; spelled ''q\u00ec'' in [[Pinyin]] [[romanization]] and ''ch'i4'' in [[Wade\u2013Giles]]) or '''ki''' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[romanization of Japanese|romanization]]), is a fundamental concept of traditional [[China|Chinese]] culture. Qi is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of \"[[Vitalism|life force]]\" or \"[[energy (spirituality)|spiritual energy]]\". It is frequently translated as \"energy flow\", or literally as \"air\" or \"breath\". (For example, \"ti\u0101nq\u00ec\", literally \"sky breath\", is the ordinary Chinese word for \"[[weather]]\"). In Mandarin Chinese it is pronounced something like \"chee\" in English, but the tongue position is different.  (See [[Media:Difficult Sounds.GIF]].) The concept of qi is often [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], however no scientific evidence supports its existence.\n\nThe element air also appears as a concept in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy which has an ancient history in China.\n\nSome Western modern occultists equate the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical element]] of [[metal (classical element)|metal]] with ''air'',<ref>Donald Michael Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', p. 115.</ref> others with [[Wood (Wu Xing)|wood]] due to the elemental association of wind and wood in the [[bagua]].\n\n[[Enlil]] was the god of air in ancient [[Sumer]]. [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of air and the husband of [[Tefnut]], goddess of moisture.

Shu played a primary role in the [[Coffin Texts]], which were [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely.

It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world.  Due to the [[hero cult]]s, and [[chthonic]] [[List of Greek mythological figures#Chthonic deities|underworld deities]], the element of ''earth'' is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later [[occultism]].\n\n[[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 \u2013}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}} proposed four ''[[arche|archai]]'' by which to understand the [[cosmos]]: ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'','' [[Air (classical element)|air]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', and ''earth''. [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 \u2013}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}} believed the elements were geometric forms (the [[platonic solid]]s) and he assigned the [[cube]] to the element of ''earth'' in his dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22\u201323; [[Gregory Vlastos]], ''Plato's Universe'', pp. 66\u201382.</ref> [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE) believed ''earth'' was the heaviest element, and his theory of ''[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|natural place]]'' suggested that any ''earth\u2013laden'' substances, would fall quickly, straight down, towards the center of the ''cosmos''.<ref>[[G. E. R.

[[Melancholia|Black bile]] was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold and dry. Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of [[fall]], since it increased the qualities of cold and aridity; the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the black bile humour); the [[Femininity|feminine]]; and the southern point of the compass.\n\n[[Image:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for earth]]\n\nIn [[alchemy]], earth was believed to be primarily dry, and secondarily cold, (as per Aristotle). Beyond those classical attributes, the chemical substance [[salt]], was associated with earth and its [[alchemical symbol]] was a downward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.\n\n==Indian tradition==\n{{Main|Prithvi}}\n'''Prithvi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|p\u1e5bthv\u012b}}'', also ''{{IAST|p\u1e5bthiv\u012b}}'') is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''earth'' and [[mother goddess]]. According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the [[Earth]] itself; according to another, its actual [[mother]], being ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Tattwa]]'', the essence of the element earth.\n\nAs ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]]'', or \"[[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]\", she contrasts with ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'', \"[[Sky Father|father sky]]\". In the [[Rigveda]], ''earth'' and sky are frequently addressed as a [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]], often indicated by the idea of two complementary \"half-shells.\" In addition, the element Earth is associated with [[Budha]] or Mercury who represents communication, business, mathematics and other practical matters.\n\n==Ceremonial magic==\nEarth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] system.

It aired on [[BBC Radio 1]] in the early hours of the morning from 1997 to 1999.\n\nThe programme gained cult status due to its unique mix of surreal monologue, music, synthesised voices, heavily edited broadcasts and recurring sketches. It featured vocal performances of [[Kevin Eldon]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Mark Heap]], David Cann and [[Amelia Bullmore]], with Morris himself delivering disturbing monologues, one of which was revamped and made into the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-winning short film ''[[My Wrongs 8245\u20138249 & 117|My Wrongs #8245\u20138249 & 117]]''. Writers who contributed to the programme included [[Graham Linehan]], [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[David Quantick]], [[Jane Bussmann]], Robert Katz and the cast.\n\nThe programme was adapted into the TV series ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'', which aired in 2000. All episodes of ''Blue Jam'' are currently available for streaming and download on the [[Internet Archive]].\n\n== Inspiration ==\n\nOn his inspiration for making the show, Morris commented: \"It was so singular, and it came from a mood, quite a desolate mood. I had this misty, autumnal, boggy mood anyway, so I just went with that\".<ref name=\"Plunkett\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/25/chris-morris-blue-jam-repeated-radio-4 |title=Chris Morris's ''Blue Jam'' Back After 17 Years <nowiki>| Media |</nowiki> The Guardian |last=Plunkett |first=John |date=24 February 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> Morris also described the show as being \"like the nightmares you have when you fall asleep listening to the [[BBC World Service]]\" (a reference to the World Service also appears in one of the monologues read by Morris).\n\n==Format and style==\n\nEach episode opened (and closed) with a short spoken monologue (delivered by Morris) describing, in surreal, broken language, various bizarre feelings and situations (for example: \"when you sick so sad you cry, and in crying cry a whole leopard from your eye\"), set to ambient music interspersed with short clips of other songs and sounds. The introduction would always end with \"welcome in Blue Jam\", inviting the listener, who is presumably experiencing such feelings, to get lost in the program. (This format was replicated in the television adaptation ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'', often reusing opening monologues from series 3 of the radio series.) The sketches within dealt with heavy and taboo topics, such as murder, suicide, missing or dead children, and rape.\n\n===Common recurring sketches===\n*'''Doctor''' (played by David Cann): \"The Doctor\" is a seemingly \"normal\" physician working in a standard British medical practice. However, he has a habit of treating his patients in bizarre and often disturbing ways, such as prescribing heroin for a cold, making a man with a headache jump up and down in order to make his penis swing (while mirroring the patient's bewildered jumping himself) and making a patient leave and go into the next room so he can examine him over the telephone. His name is revealed to be '''Michael Perlin''' in several sketches.\n*'''The Monologue Man''' (played by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]): Short stories, often up to 10 minutes in length, written from the perspective of a lonely and socially inept man. Each story usually involves the protagonist's acquaintance Suzy in some capacity.\n*'''Michael Alexander St. John''': A parody of hyperbolic and pun-laden radio presenting, St. John presents items such as the top 10 singles charts and the weekend's gigs.\n*'''Bad Sex''': Short clips of two lovers (played by [[Julia Davis]] and [[Kevin Eldon]]) making increasingly bizarre erotic requests of one another, such as to \"shit your leg off\" and \"make your spunk come out green\".\n*'''The Interviewer''' (played by Chris Morris): conducting real interviews with celebrities such as [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] and [[Jerry Springer]], Morris confuses and mocks his subjects with ambiguous and odd questions.\n*'''Mr. Ventham''' (played by [[Mark Heap]]): An extremely awkward man who requires one-to-one consultations with '''Mr. Reilly''' (played by David Cann), who seems to be his psychologist, for the most banal of matters.\n\nThe sketches not listed are typically in the style of a documentary; characters speak as if being interviewed about a recent event. In one sketch, a character voiced by Morris describes a man attempting to commit suicide by jumping off a second-story balcony repeatedly; in another, an angry man (Eldon) shouts about how his car, after being picked up from the garage, is only four feet long.\n\n===Radio stings===\nMorris included a series of 'radio stings', bizarre sequences of sounds and prose as a parody of modern DJs' own soundbites and self-advertising pieces. Each one revolves around a contemporary DJ, such as [[Chris Moyles]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Mark Goodier]], typically involving each DJ dying in a graphic way or going mad in some form \u2013 for example, Chris Moyles covering himself in jam and hanging himself from the top of a building.\n\n==Episodes==\n\nThree series were produced, with a total of eighteen episodes. All episodes were originally broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 1. Series 1 was broadcast from 14 November to 19 December 1997; series 2 was broadcast from 27 March to 1 May 1998; and series 3 broadcast from 21 January to 25 February 1999.\n\n*Series 1 \u2013 (Fridays) 14 November 1997 to 19 December 1997, from 00:00 to 01:00.\n*Series 2 \u2013 (Fridays) 27 March 1998 to 1 May 1998, from 01:00 to 02:00.\n*Series 3 \u2013 (Thursdays) 21 January 1999 to 25 February 1999, from 00:00 to 01:00.\n\nThe first five episodes of series 1 of ''Blue Jam'' were repeated by [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in February and March 2014, and series 2 was rebroadcast in December.<ref name=\"Plunkett\"/>\n\n{{Episode table\n|background=#1254A4\n|overall= 1 |title= 4\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1.1\n|Title           = ee arth welcome\n|ShortSummary   = Sketches include: The Gun & The Gibbon monologue, babies fighting each other, Radio 1 ''[[Newsbeat]]'', and the Doctor kissing things to make them better.

Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catterall|first1=Peter|title=The Making of Channel 4|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135018870}}<!--|accessdate=18 February 2016--></ref> the station is now owned and operated by [[Channel Four Television Corporation]], a public corporation of the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4|url=httpspublisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref> which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.\n\nThe channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the [[television licence|licence]]-funded [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]], and the single commercial broadcasting network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Further information|Timeline of Channel 4}}\n\n===Conception===\n{{main article|Fourth UK television service}}\n\nBefore Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services: [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] began the process of adding a fourth, and Channel 4, along with its [[S4C|Welsh counterpart]], was formally created by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.\n\nThe notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an \"ITV2\" (which came in 1998) was long expected and pushed for. Indeed, television sets sold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s had a spare tuning button labelled \"ITV/IBA 2\". Throughout [[History of ITV|ITV's history]] and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the [[General Post Office|GPO]], [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]], the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take. It was most likely politics which had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/> \n\nOne clear benefit of the \"late arrival\" of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early 1960s, when the launch of an ITV2 was highly anticipated.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/> This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK-based transmissions; a stark contrast to the problems associated with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s launch almost 15 years later.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Wales===\n{{Main article|S4C}}\nAt the time the fourth service was being considered, a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh-language programmes, then only catered for at \"off peak\" times on [[BBC Wales]] and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]. The campaign was taken so seriously by [[Gwynfor Evans]], former president of [[Plaid Cymru]], that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans.<ref name=\"seefour_wales\">{{cite web| url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/seefour/wales | title=A Channel for Wales | author=Dafydd Hancock | publisher=seefour by Electromusications| website=transdiffusion.org| date=11 September 2005 | accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe result was that Channel 4 as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by ''[[S4C|Sianel Pedwar Cymru]] (S4C)'' (''Channel Four Wales''). Operated by a specially created [[S4C Authority|authority]], S4C would air programmes in Welsh made by HTV, the BBC and independent companies. Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel 4 could not be broadcast alongside S4C, though some Channel 4 programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant, a practice that carried on up until the closure of S4C's analogue transmissions in 2010 when S4C became a fully Welsh channel.\n\nSince then, carriage on digital [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial]] has introduced Channel 4 to Welsh homes where it is now universally available.\n\n===Launch and IBA control===\nThe first voice heard on Channel 4's opening day of Tuesday 2 November 1982 was that of [[continuity announcer]] [[Paul Coia]] who said:\n\n{{cquote|Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you, welcome to Channel Four.}}\n\nFollowing the announcement, the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, \"Fourscore\", written by [[Lord David Dundas|David Dundas]], which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', at 16:45 produced by [[Yorkshire Television]]. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was [[Richard Whiteley]] with [[Ted Moult]] being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not Whiteley's ''Countdown'' co-host [[Carol Vorderman]] but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words:\n\n{{cquote|As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins.}}\n\nOn its first day, Channel 4 also broadcast controversial soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', which ran until 2003.\n\nOn its launch, Channel 4 committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels, an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups.\n\nIn step with its remit, the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period, especially under founding chief executive [[Jeremy Isaacs]], where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts. Channel 4 co-commissioned [[Robert Ashley]]'s ground-breaking television opera ''Perfect Lives'',<ref>[http://www.robertashley.org/operas/perfectlives.htm Robert Ashley-Perfect Lives<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> which it premiered over several episodes in 1984. The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period, however, as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest.\n\nChannel 4 also began the funding of independent films, such as the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[docudrama]] ''[[The Courtesans of Bombay]]'', during this time.\n\nIn 1992, Channel 4 also faced its first libel case by [[Jani Allan]], a South African journalist, who objected to her representation in [[Nick Broomfield]]'s documentary ''[[The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/901342.stm|title=Victims of the 'silver fox'|accessdate=20 August 2007 |work=BBC News |date=29 August 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1993, the channel broadcast the [[Television film|direct-to-TV]] documentary film ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'', in which it displayed the dominant position of the [[Rede Globo]] television network, and discussed its influence, power and political connections in Brazil.\n\n===Channel Four Television Corporation===\n[[File:Channel 4 Horseferry Road 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Channel 4 headquarters,<br>[[124 Horseferry Road]], London dated 2008.]]\n{{Main article|Channel Four Television Corporation}}\nAfter control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] in 1993, a shift in broadcasting style took place. Instead of aiming for the fringes of society, it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream, and the centre of the mass market itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2007}} It began to show many US programmes in peak viewing time, far more than it had previously done. It gave such shows as ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' their UK premi\u00e8res.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Channel 4 began broadcasting reality formats such as ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' and obtained the rights to broadcast mass appeal sporting events like [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]]. This new direction increased ratings and revenues.\n\nIn addition, the corporation launched a number of new television channels through its new [[Channel Four Television Corporation#4Ventures|4Ventures]] offshoot, including [[Film4]], [[At the Races]], [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and [[More4]].\n\nPartially in reaction to its new \"populist\" direction, the [[Communications Act 2003]] directed the channel to demonstrate innovation, experimentation and creativity, appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nOn 31 December 2004, Channel 4 launched a new look and new idents in which the logo is disguised as different objects and the 4 can be seen in an angle.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] founder [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], 2005 saw a change of direction for Channel 4's digital channels. Channel 4 made E4 [[free-to-air]] on [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital terrestrial television]], and launched a new free-to-air digital channel called More4. By October, Channel 4 had joined the Freeview consortium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225|title=DTG News: ITV and Channel 4 confirm Freeview stakes|accessdate=3 April 2007}}</ref> By July 2006, Film4 had also become a free-to-air and restarted broadcasting on digital terrestrial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |title=CHANNEL4SALES : NEWS |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708233806/http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |archivedate=8 July 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nVenturing into radio broadcasting, 2005 saw Channel 4 purchase 51% of shares in the now defunct [[Oneword]] radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares. New programmes such as the weekly, half-hour ''The Morning Report'' news programme were among some of the new content Channel 4 provided for the station, with the name [[#4radio|4Radio]] being used. As of early 2009, however, Channel 4's future involvement in radio remained uncertain.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the station celebrated its 25th birthday. It showed the first episode of ''Countdown'', an anniversary ''Countdown'' special, as well as [[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year#The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz|a special edition of ''The Big Fat Quiz'']] and using the original multicoloured 1982\u20131996 blocks logo on presentation and idents using the Fourscore jingle throughout the day.\n\nIn November 2009, Channel 4 launched a week of [[3D television]], broadcasting selected programmes each night using [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[ColorCode 3D]] technology. The accompanying 3D glasses were distributed through [[Sainsbury's]] supermarkets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/3d-week|title=3D Week \u2013 Channel 4<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Channel 4 revamped its presentation for a fifth time; the new branding downplayed the \"4\" logo from most on-air usage, in favour of using the shapes from the logo in various forms. Four new idents were filmed by [[Jonathan Glazer]], which featured the shapes in various real-world scenes depicting the \"discovery\" and \"origins\" of the shapes. The full logo was still occasionally used, but primarily for off-air marketing. Channel 4 also commissioned two new corporate typefaces, \"Chadwick\", and \"Horseferry\" (a variation of Chadwick with the aforementioned shapes incorporated into its letter forms), for use across promotional material and on-air.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/|first=Eliza|last=Williams|date=30 September 2015|title=Channel 4 rebrands, with help from Jonathan Glazer and Neville Brody|publisher=[[Creative Review]]|access-date=4 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424113200/https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/|archive-date=24 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/channel-4-ditches-signature-4-logo-in-brave-and-bizarre-rebrand-a6674156.html|title=Channel 4 ditches signature '4' logo in 'brave and bizarre' rebrand|accessdate=14 February 2017 | work=The Independent | first=Adam | last=Sherwin | date=1 October 2015}}</ref> On 31 October 2017, Channel 4 introduced a new series of idents continuing the theme, this time depicting the logo shapes as having formed an [[anthropomorphic]] \"giant\" character.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/channel-4-logo-becomes-c4-giant-in-quirky-new-idents/|title=Channel 4 logo becomes \"C4 giant\" in quirky new idents|date=31 October 2017|work=Creative Review|access-date=7 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nChannel 4 has raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations after digital switch-over.

In practice, however, these other activities are loss-making, and are subsidised by the main network. According to Channel 4's last published accounts, for 2005, the extent of this cross-subsidy was some \u00a330 million.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf 11419_11419_C4<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615192437/http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf |date=15 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe change in funding came about under the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself. Originally this arrangement left a \"safety net\" guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low, funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies. Such a subsidy was never required, however, and these premiums were phased out by the government in 1998. After the link with ITV was cut, the cross-promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel 4 also ended.\n\nIn 2007 due to severe funding difficulties, the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of \u00a314 million over a six-year period. The money would have come from the television licence fee and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jowell-challenges-channel-4-to-justify-16314m-of-public-funding-454035.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Jowell challenges Channel 4 to justify \u00a314m of public funding | first=Ian | last=Burrell | date=21 June 2007 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> The plan was scrapped by The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Andy Burnham]], ahead of \"broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7750501.stm | work=BBC News | title=Channel 4 switchover cash shelved | date=26 November 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\nThe broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] released its review in January 2009 in which it suggested that Channel 4 would preferably be funded by \"partnerships, joint ventures or mergers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/psb2_phase2/statement/|title=Ofcom's second Public Service Broadcasting Review - Phase Two: preparing for the digital future|website=Ofcom}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nChannel 4 is a \"publisher-broadcaster\", meaning that it commissions or \"buys\" all of its programming from companies independent of itself, and was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale; such commissioning is a stipulation which is included in its licence to broadcast.<ref name=\"schools\"/> This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an ITV licence to see their programmes air, though since Channel 4, external commissioning has become regular practice on the numerous stations that have launched since, as well as on the [[BBC]] and in ITV (where a quota of 25% minimum of total output has been imposed since the 1990 Broadcasting Act came into force).

Other, less specific strands, were (and still are) run regularly, such as ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', a strand of programming aimed at teenagers, on weekend mornings (and weekdays during school/college holidays); ''Friday Night Comedy'', a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions, ''4Music'' (now a separate channel) and ''[[4Later]]'', an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted in the early hours of the morning.\n\nIn its earlier years, ''[[Red triangle (Channel 4)|Red Triangle]]'' was the name given to the airing of certain risqu\u00e9 art-house films due to the use of a red triangle [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the upper right of the screen, dubbed as being pornographic by many of Channel 4's critics, while general broadcasting of films on the station for many years came under the banner of ''Film on Four'' prior to the launch of the ''FilmFour'' brand and station in the late 1990s.\n\n=== Most watched programmes ===\nThe following is a list of the 10 most watched shows on Channel 4 since launch, based on Live +7 data supplied by [[BARB]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30 |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes |publisher=Barb.co.uk |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> and archival data published by Channel 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/media/documents/corporate/foi-docs/4_at_25.pdf | title=Top 50 Programmes on Channel 4 1982 \u2013 2007 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Ranelagh's first major commission caused a furore, a three-part documentary series called ''[[Jesus: The Evidence]]''.  The programmes, transmitted during the Easter period of 1984, seemed to advocate the idea that the Gospels were unreliable, Jesus may have indulged in witchcraft, and that he may not have even existed.  The series triggered a public outcry, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the UK's broadcasting and religious institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Film ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nNumerous genres of film-making \u2013 such as comedy, drama, documentary, adventure/action, romance and horror/thriller \u2013 are represented in the channel's schedule. From the launch of Channel 4 until 1998, film presentations on C4 would often be broadcast under the \"Film on Four\" banner.{{cn|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn March 2005, Channel 4 screened the uncut [[Lars von Trier]] film ''[[The Idiots]]'', which includes unsimulated sexual intercourse, making it the first UK terrestrial channel to do so. The channel had previously screened other films with similar material but censored and with warnings.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nSince 1 November 1998, Channel 4 has had a digital subsidiary channel dedicated to the screening of films. This channel launched as a paid subscription channel under the name \"FilmFour\", and was relaunched in July 2006 as a free-to-air channel under the current name of \"[[Film4]]\". The Film4 channel carries a wide range of film productions, including acquired and Film4-produced projects. Channel 4's general entertainment channels [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and [[More4]] also screen feature films at certain points in the schedule as part of their content mix.\n\n=== Wank Week ===\n\n{{main article|Wank Week}}\n\nA season of television programmes about [[masturbation]], called ''Wank Week'', was to be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4 in March 2007.  The first show was about a [[Masturbate-a-thon]], a public mass masturbation event, organised to raise money for the [[sexual health]] charity [[Marie Stopes International]].  Another film would have focused on compulsive male masturbators and a third was to feature the [[sex education|sex educator]] Dr [[Betty Dodson]].\n\nThe series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4 |title=Channel 4 postpones 'wank week' programming |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n=== Global warming ===\n\nOn 8 March 2007 Channel 4 screened the highly controversial documentary ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]''.

These four sites include features, profiles and interviews in text, audio and video formats, divided into five zones: TV, Film, Radio, New Media and Extras, which covers other arts such as theatre, music and design. 4Talent also collates networking, showcasing and professional development opportunities, and runs workshops, masterclasses, seminars and showcasing events across the UK.\n\n==== ''4Talent Magazine'' ====\n\n''4Talent magazine'' is the creative industries magazine from 4Talent, which launched in 2005 as TEN4 magazine under the editorship of Dan Jones. ''4Talent Magazine'' is currently edited by Nick Carson. Other staff include deputy editor Catherine Bray and production editor Helen Byrne. The magazine covers rising and established figures of interest in the creative industries, a remit including film, radio, TV, comedy, music, new media and design.\n\nSubjects are usually UK-based, with contributing editors based in Northern Ireland, Scotland, London and Birmingham, but the publication has been known to source international content from Australia, America, continental Europe and the Middle East. The magazine is frequently organised around a theme for the issue, for instance giving half of November 2007's pages over to profiling winners of the annual 4Talent Awards.\n\nAn unusual feature of the magazine's credits is the equal prominence given to the names of writers, photographers, designers and illustrators, contradicting standard industry practice of more prominent writer bylines. It is also recognisable for its 'wraparound' covers, which use the front and back as a continuous canvas \u2013 often produced by guest artists.\n\nAlthough ''4Talent Magazine'' is technically a newsstand title, a significant proportion of its readers are subscribers. It started life as a quarterly 100-page title, but has since doubled in size and is now published bi-annually.\n\n==Presentation==\n\nSince its launch in 1982, Channel 4 has used the same logo which consists of a stylised numeral \"4\" made up of nine differently-shaped blocks. The logo was designed by [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]] and his brother Robinson and was the first channel in the UK to depict an ident made using advanced computer generation (the first electronically-generated ident was on [[BBC Two]] in 1979, but this was two-dimensional). It was designed in conjunction with Bo Gehring Aviation of Los Angeles and originally depicted the \"4\" in red, yellow, green, blue and purple. The music accompanying the ident was called \"Fourscore\" and was composed by [[Lord David Dundas]], later released as a single alongside with a B-side, \"Fourscore Two\", although neither appeared in the UK charts. In November 1992, \"Fourscore\" was replaced by new music.\n\nIn 1996, Channel 4 commissioned Tomato Films to revamp the \"4\", which resulted in the \"Circles\" idents showing four white circles forming up transparently over various scenes, with the \"4\" logo depicted in white in one of the circles.\n\nIn 1999, Spin redesigned the logo to feature in a single square which sat on the right-hand side of the screen, whilst various stripes would move along from left to right, often lighting the squared \"4\" up. Like the \"Circles\" idents, the stripes would be interspersed with various scenes potentially related to the upcoming programme.\n\nThe logo was made three-dimensional again in 2004 when it was depicted in filmed scenes that show the blocks forming the \"4\" logo for less than a second before the action moves away again.\n\nIn 2015, the logo was disassembled completely to allow the blocks to appear as parts of a nature scene, sometimes featuring a strange dancing creature and sometimes being excavated for scientific study, one being studied under a microscope and showing a [[tardigrade]]. The second wave of these idents, launched in 2017, depict a giant creature made of the \"4\" blocks (made to look almost like a person) interacting with everyday life, sometimes shouting the \"Fourscore\" theme as a foghorn.\n\n==Regions/International ==\nChannel 4 has, since its inception, broadcast identical programmes and [[continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] throughout the United Kingdom (excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters). At launch this made it unique, as both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had long established traditions of providing [[regional variations]] in their programming in different areas of the country. Since the launch of subsequent British television channels, Channel 4 has become typical in its lack of regional programming variations.\n\nA few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity:\n\nSome of Channel 4's schools' programming (1980s/early '90s) were regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions.<ref name=\"itvschools\"/>\n\nPart of Channel 4's remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London. Channel 4 has a dedicated director of nations and regions, [[Stuart Cosgrove]], who is based in a regional office in Glasgow. As his job title suggests, it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom (including Wales) outside London.\n\nAdvertising on Channel 4 does contain regular variation: prior to 1993, when ITV was responsible for selling Channel 4's advertising, each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks, covering the same transmitter area as themselves, and these breaks were often unique to that area. After Channel 4 became responsible for its own advertising, it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six regions: London, South,  Midlands, North, Northern Ireland and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map|title=Channel 4's 'Macro Regions' for advertising, including a map |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220084700/http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAt present, Wales does not have its own advertising region, instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area, or the neighbouring region where terrestrial transmissions spill over into Wales. The Republic of Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland (referred to by Channel 4 as the 'Ulster Macro') with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here.<ref name=\"foursales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |title=Channel 4's Dublin Sales Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527224137/http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}</ref> [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] has an advertising variant for Ireland, although Northern Ireland receives the UK version of E4.<ref name=\"foursales\"/> The six regions are also carried on satellite, cable and Digital Terrestrial.\n\n[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[ITV Breakfast]] use a similar model to Channel 4 for providing their own advertising regions, despite also having a single national output of programming.\n\nDespite the Republic of Ireland not being in the UK, Channel 4 has a dedicated variant broadcast on Sky Ireland which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland. For example, the series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] is not available on Channel 4 on Sky in Ireland. In recent years a Republic of Ireland advertising opt-out has been added to this version.\n\n===Future possibility of regional news===\nWith [[ITV plc]] pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions, the idea of Channel 4 taking on a regional news commitment has been considered, with the corporation in talks with [[Ofcom]] and ITV over the matter.<ref name=\"c4moveregional\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/03/channel4.ofcom | title=Channel 4 ponders move into regional news as ITV retreats | work=The Guardian | author=Leigh Holmwood | date=7 March 2008 | accessdate=30 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Channel 4 believe that a scaling-back of such operations on ITV's part would be detrimental to Channel 4's national news operation, which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor [[ITN]].

Tribe Arini together with the Amazonian parrots and a few miscellaneous genera make up subfamily [[Arinae]] of Neotropical parrots in family [[Psittacidae]] of [[true parrot]]s.\n\nThe specific name ''Psittacus carolinensis'' was assigned by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae]] published in 1758. The species was given its own genus ''Conuropsis'' by Italian zoologist and ornithologist [[Tommaso Salvadori]] in 1891 in his ''Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum'', volume 20. The name is derived from the Greek-ified ''conure'' (\"parrot of the genus ''[[Conurus]]''\" an obsolete name of genus ''Aratinga'') + ''-opsis'' (\"likeness of\") and Latinized ''Carolina'' (from [[Carolana]], an English colonial province{{#tag:ref|a reference to the 17th-century English province of [[Carolana]], called Florida by the Spaniards and La Louisiane by the French, a grant from King Charles I which included the territory extending from the Atlantic Ocean to New Mexico, between the 30th and 36th parallels of latitude, which encompasses on the Atlantic seaboard the modern states of North and South Carolina|group=Note}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Coxe |first=Daniel |date=1722 |title=A description of the English province of Carolana |location=London}}</ref>) + ''-ensis'' (of or \"from a place\"), therefore a bird \"like a conure from Carolina\".\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies.

The majority of the plumage was green with lighter green underparts, a bright yellow head and orange forehead and face extending to behind the eyes and upper cheeks (lores). The shoulders were yellow, continuing down the outer edge of the wings. The primary feathers were mostly green, but with yellow edges on the outer primaries. Thighs were green towards the top and yellow towards the feet. Male and female adults were identical in plumage, however males were slightly larger than females ([[sexually dimorphic]]). The legs and feet were light brown. They share the [[zygodactyl]] feet of the parrot family. The skin around the eyes was white and the beak was pale flesh colored.

The face and entire body was green, with paler underparts. They lacked yellow or orange plumage on the face, wings, and thighs. Hatchlings were covered in mouse-gray down, until about 39\u201340 days when green wings and tails appear. Fledglings had full adult plumage at around 1 year of age. (\"Nature Serve, Conuropsis carolinensis\", 2005; Fuller, 2001; Mauler, 2001; Rising, 2004; Snyder and Russell, 2002)\n\nThese birds were fairly long lived, at least in captivity - a pair was kept at the [[Cincinnati Zoo]] for over 35 years.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of a live pet specimen, 1906]] \nThe Carolina parakeet had the northern-most range of any known parrot. It was found from southern New England and New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico. It has also had a wide distribution west of the Mississippi River, as far west as eastern Colorado. Its range was described by early explorers thus: the 43rd parallel as the northern limit, the 26th as the most southern, the 73rd and 106th meridians as the eastern and western boundaries respectively, the range included all or portions of at least 28 states.{{#tag:ref|Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, N.

Virginia, Wisconsin|group=Note}} Its habitats were old-growth wetland forests along rivers and in swamps especially in the Mississippi-Missouri drainage basin with large hollow trees including [[Taxodium|cypress]] and [[Platanus occidentalis|sycamore]] to use as roosting and nesting sites.\n\nOnly very rough estimates of the birds' former prevalence can be made: with an estimated range of 20,000 to 2.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, and population density of 0.5 to 2.0 parrots per km<sup>2</sup>, population estimates range from tens of thousands to a few million birds (though the densest populations occurred in Florida covering 170,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, so there may have been hundreds of thousands of the birds in that state alone).\n\nThe species may have appeared as a very rare [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in places as far north as [[Southern Ontario]].

[[John J. Audubon]] commented as early as 1832 on the decline of the birds. The bird was rarely reported outside Florida after 1860. The last reported sighting east of the Mississippi River (except Florida) was in 1878 in Kentucky. By the turn of the century it was restricted to the swamps of central Florida. The last known wild specimen was killed in [[Okeechobee County, Florida]], in 1904, and the last captive bird died at the Cincinnati Zoo on February 21, 1918.

Hunting played a significant role, both for decorative use of their colorful feathers, for example adornment of women's hats, and for reduction of crop predation.<ref name=IUCN/> This was partially offset by recognition of their value in controlling invasive cockleburs. Minor roles were played by capture for the pet trade and, it was hypothesized{{by whom|date=September 2017}}, by the introduction for crop pollination of [[European honeybee]]s that competed for nest sites.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA factor that exacerbated their decline to extinction was the flocking behavior that led them to return to the vicinity of dead and dying birds (e.g., birds downed by hunting), enabling wholesale slaughter.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe final extinction of the species in the early years of the 20th century is somewhat of a mystery, as it happened so rapidly. Vigorous flocks with many juveniles and reproducing pairs were noted as late as 1896, and the birds were long-lived in captivity, but they had virtually disappeared by 1904. Sufficient nest sites remained intact, so deforestation was not the final cause. American ornithologist Noel F. Snyder<ref name=Snyder/> speculates that the most likely cause seems to be that the birds succumbed to poultry disease, although no recent or historical records exist of New World parrot populations being afflicted by domestic poultry diseases. The modern poultry scourge [[Newcastle disease]] was not detected until 1926 in Indonesia, and only a subacute form of it was reported in the United States in 1938.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Thick-billed parrot]], the only living parrot that had a native range in the contiguous United States, but now restricted to Mexico <!-- Puerto Rican amazon in Puerto Rico + blue-crowned lorikeet in American Samoa -->\n* [[Monk parakeet]], a prevalent feral parrot in the United States often incorrectly presumed to be native\n* [[Feral parrot]]s, other non-native parrots in the United States\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cokinos, Christopher (2009) ''Hope Is the Thing with Feathers: A Personal Chronicle of Vanished Birds'' (Chapter 1: Carolina Parakeet), Tarcher {{ISBN|978-1585427222}}\n* Snyder, Noel (2004) ''The Carolina Parakeet: Glimpses of a Vanished Bird'', Princeton University Press {{ISBN|978-0691117959}}\n* Julian P.

During [[World War II]], a US submarine, the [[USS Puffer (SS-268)]], came under several hours of [[depth charge]] attack by a Japanese surface vessel until the ship became convinced the submarine had somehow escaped. Psychological studies later showed that crewmen transferred to the submarine after the event were never accepted as part of the [[team]]. Later, US naval policy was changed so that after events of such psychological trauma, the crew would be dispersed to new assignments.\n\nRehabilitation of survivors becomes extremely difficult when entire nation has experienced such severe traumas as war, genocide, torture, massacre, etc. Treatment is hardly effective when everybody is traumatized. Trauma remains chronic and would reproduce itself as long as social causes are not addressed and perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity. The whole society may suffer from an everlasting culture of pain. (1)\n\nDuring the [[Algerian War]], [[Frantz Omar Fanon]] found his practice of treatment of native Algerians ineffective due to the continuation of the horror of a colonial war. He emphasized about the social origin of traumas, joined the liberation movement and urged oppressed people to purge themselves of their degrading traumas through their collective liberation struggle. He made the following remarks in his letter of resignation, as the Head of the Psychiatry Department at the Blida-Joinville Hospital in Algeria:<blockquote>\"If psychiatry is the medical technique that aims to enable man no longer to be a stranger to his environment, I owe it to myself to affirm that the Arab, permanently an alien in his own country, lives in a state of absolute depersonalization.\" (2) Inculcation of horror and anxiety, through widespread torture, massacre, genocide and similar coercive measures has happened frequently in human history. There are plenty of examples in our modern history. Tyrants have always used their technique of \"psychological artillery\" in an attempt to cause havoc and confusion in the minds of people and hypnotize them with intimidation and cynicism. The result is a collective trauma that will [[Transgenerational trauma|pass through generations]]. There is no magic formula of rehabilitation.

The term is often used by [[Christian]]s to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used (by analogy) to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], the church is often arranged in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the longest part of a cross is represented by the [[aisle]] and the junction of the cross is located at the [[altar]] area.\n\nTowers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring visitors. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and conversely many original church buildings have been put to other uses.\n\nThe earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] ([[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd|\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriak\u00f3s o\u00edkos''\" ({{lang|grc|K\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriak\u0113''\" ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriak\u0113 proseukh\u0113''\" ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|\"Cyrican\" was an Old English word for churches and church property]]\nIn standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''\u00e9glise'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />\n\nIn the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.

Instead, they gathered in homes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:5 Acts 17:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A20&version=NIV 20:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&version=NIV 1 Corinthians 16:19]) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or [[synagogue]]s ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A46&version=NIV Acts 2:46], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+19%3A8&version=NIV 19:8]).

In addition to being a place of worship, the cathedral or the parish church was used by the community in other ways. It could serve as a meeting place for [[guilds]] or a hall for [[banquet]]s. [[Mystery plays]] were sometimes performed in cathedrals, and cathedrals might also be used for [[fair]]s. The church could be used as a place to thresh and store grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>\n\n==== Romanesque architecture ====\nBetween 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the name of the romanesque era refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], it was actually a West- and Central European trend. Romanesque buildings appear rather bulky and compact. Typical features are [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on the pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] was more popular. The rooms became wider and the motivs of [[sculpture]]s became more epic.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic architecture ====\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[\u00cele-de-France]] and spread through all of Europe. The gothic buildings were less compact than they had been in the romanesque era and often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegoric]] features. For the first time, [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es were used, with the result that massive walls were not longer needed to stabilise the building. Due to that advantage, the area of the windows became bigger, which resulted in a brighter and more friendly atmosphere inside the church. The [[nave]] became higher and so did the pillars and the church steeple. The amibition to test out the limits of the architectural possibilities resulted in the collapse of several towers. In [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], but also in [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] has the same height.\n\nCathedrals were built in a very lavish way, as in the romanesque era. Examples for that are the [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and the [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, but also the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d\u2019Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and the [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[Lavenham]], [[England]].\n\nMany gothic churches contain features from the romanesque era. Some of the most well-known gothic churches stayed unfinished for hundreds of years, after the gothic style was not popular anymore. About half of the [[Cologne Cathedral]] was for example build in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=renaissance+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=renaissance%20architecture&f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].\n\n=== Baroque architecture ===\nThe [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence.The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baroque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=baroque%20architecture&f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=J\u00f6rg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main article|Church architecture}}\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]\nA common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J.

These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the \"west\" end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].\n\nAnother common feature of many Christian churches is the [[Orientation of churches|eastwards orientation]] of the front [[altar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/sacred_places_the_significance_of_the_church_building/|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture {{!}} Articles {{!}} Sacred Places: The Significance of the Church Building|website=www.sacredarchitecture.org|access-date=2017-08-16}}</ref> \nOften, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise.

Although not in its original form, it is more elaborate than most of the [[Dartmoor crosses|crosses on Dartmoor]], being raised upon a constructed base, and it is known that a [[kistvaen]] is underneath.\n\nA well-known legend attached to the site, first recorded in 1630 by [[Tristram Risdon]], concerns a wealthy hunter, Childe, who became lost in a snow storm and supposedly died there despite disembowelling his horse and climbing into its body for protection. The legend relates that Childe left a note of some sort saying that whoever found and buried his body would inherit his lands at [[Plymstock]]. After a race between the monks of [[Tavistock Abbey]] and the men of Plymstock, the Abbey won.\n\nThe tomb was virtually destroyed in 1812 by a man who stole most of the stones to build a house nearby, but it was partly reconstructed in 1890.\n\n==Description==\nChilde's Tomb is a reconstructed granite cross on the south-east edge of [[Foxtor Mires]], about 500 metres north of [[Fox Tor]] on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], England at {{gbmapping|SX625704}}. According to William Burt, in his notes to ''Dartmoor, a Descriptive Poem'' by N. T. Carrington (1826), the original tomb consisted of a pedestal of three steps, the lowest of which was built of four stones each six feet long and twelve inches square. The two upper steps were made of eight shorter but similarly shaped stones, and on top was an octagonal block about three feet high with a cross fixed upon it.<ref>Reported by Crossing (1902) p. 89</ref>\n\nThe tomb lies on the line of several cairns that marked the east-west route of the ancient Monks' Path between [[Buckfast Abbey]] and [[Tavistock Abbey]] and it was no doubt erected here as part of that route: it would have been particularly useful in this part of the moor with few landmarks where a traveller straying from the path could easily end up in Foxtor Mires.<ref name=B218/> [[Tristram Risdon]], writing in about 1630, said that Childe's Tomb was one of three remarkable things in the [[Forest of Dartmoor]] (the others being [[Crockern Tor]] and [[Wistman's Wood]]).<ref>Risdon (1811) pp. 222\u20133</ref> Risdon also stated that the original tomb bore an inscription: \"They fyrste that fyndes and bringes mee to my grave, The priorie of Plimstoke they shall have\",<ref name=R198/> but no sign of this has ever been found.\n\nToday the cross, which is a replacement, is about {{convert|3|ft|4|in|m}} tall and {{convert|1|ft|8|in|m}} across at the crosspiece, and it has its base in a socket stone which rests on a pedestal of granite blocks that raises the total height of the cross to {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The original, now broken, socket stone for the cross lies nearby.

The moorman also said that they had lettering on their undersides.<ref>Crossing (1902) p. 93</ref> This encouraged Crossing to arrange to lift the clapper bridge, but no inscription was found. However, he did locate nine out of the twelve stones that had made up the pedestal, as well as the broken socket stone for the cross.<ref name=S42/>\n\n==Reconstruction==\nCrossing rediscovered the original site of the tomb in 1882 and said that all that remained was a small mound and some half buried stones. He cleared out the kistvaen, reporting that it was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} long by {{convert|2|ft|8|in|cm}} wide and that unlike most kistvaens found on the moor, the stones lining it had apparently been shaped by man, which led him to suggest that it was less old than most.<ref>Crossing (1902) p. 91</ref> Having located most of the stones of the original tomb, Crossing thought that it could be rebuilt in its original form with little effort, but it was not to be.<ref>Crossing (1902) pp. 93\u20134</ref>\n\nJ. Brooking Rowe, writing in 1895, states that the tomb was re-erected in 1890 under the direction of Mr. E. Fearnley Tanner, who said that he was dissatisfied with the result because several stones were missing and it was difficult to recreate the original character of the monument.<ref>Rowe (1985) pp. 188\u20139</ref> Tanner was the honourable secretary of the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]],<ref name=S44>Stanbrook (1994) p. 44</ref> and this reconstruction was one of the first acts of that organisation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The replacement base and cross were made in Holne in 1885.<ref name=S44/>\n\n==Childe the Hunter==\n[[File:Childe's tomb 1.jpg|thumb|right|View of the setting of Childe's Tomb]]\nAccording to legend, the cross was erected over the [[kistvaen]] ('chest-stone' i.e. burial chamber) of Childe the Hunter, who was Ordulf, son of [[Ordgar]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] Earl of [[Devon]] in the 11th century. The name ''[[Childe]]'' is probably derived from the [[Old English]] word ''cild'' which was used as a title of honour.<ref name=F277/>\n\nLegend has it that Childe was in a party hunting on the moor when they were caught in some changeable weather. Childe became separated from the main party and was lost. In order to save himself from dying of exposure, he killed his horse, disembowelled it and crept inside the warm carcass for shelter. He nevertheless froze to death, but before he died, he wrote a note to the effect that whoever should find him and bury him in their church should inherit his Plymstock estate.\n\nHis body was found by the monks of [[Tavistock Abbey]], who started to carry it back. However, they heard of a plot to ambush them by the people of Plymstock, at a bridge over the [[River Tavy]]. They took a detour and built a new bridge over the river, just outside Tavistock. They were successful in burying the body in the grounds of the Abbey and inherited the Plymstock estate.\n\nThe first account of this story is to be found in [[Tristram Risdon|Risdon]]'s ''Survey of Devon'' which was completed in around 1632:\n\n{{quote|It is left us by tradition that one Childe of Plimstoke, a man of fair possessions, having no issue, ordained, by his will, that wheresoever he should happen to be buried, to that church his lands should belong. It so fortuned, that he riding to hunt in the forest of Dartmore, being in pursuit of his game, casually lost his company, and his way likewise. The season then being so cold, and he so benumed therewith, as he was enforced to kill his horse, and embowelled him, to creep into his belly to get heat; which not able to preserve him, was there frozen to death; and so found, was carried by Tavistoke men to be buried in the church of that abbey; which was so secretly done but the inhabitants of Plymstoke had knowledge thereof; which to prevent, they resorted to defend the carriage of the corpse over the bridge, where, they conceived, necessity compelled them to pass. But they were deceived by guile; for the Tavistoke men forthwith built a slight bridge, and passed over at another place without resistance, buried the body, and enjoyed the lands; in memory whereof the bridge beareth the name of Guilebridge to this day.<ref name=R198>Risdon (1811) pp. 198\u20139</ref>}}\n\nFinberg pointed out, however, that a document of 1651 refers to Tavistock's guildhall as ''Guilehall'', so ''Guilebridge'' is more likely to be ''guild bridge'', probably because it was built or maintained by one of the town guilds.<ref name=F277>Finberg (1946) p. 277</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\n[[Devon]] folk singer [[Seth Lakeman]] sang about Childe the Hunter on his 2006 album ''[[Freedom Fields]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Crossing\n|first=William\n|authorlink=William Crossing\n|title=The Ancient Stone Crosses of Dartmoor and its Borderland\n|year=1902\n|publisher=James G.

For example, the [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' (\"table\") are cognates because they both come from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar letters in the word. Some words sound similar, but don't come from the same root; these are called false cognates.\n\nIn [[etymology]], the ''cognate'' category excludes [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and [[loanword]]s. The word ''cognate'' derives from the Latin noun ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'', which means \"blood relative\".<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate \"cognate\"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: \"Latin ''cogn\u0101tus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gn\u0101tus'', born, past participle of ''n\u0101sc\u012b'', to be born.\" Other definitions of the English word include \"[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor\" and \"[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function\".</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nCognates do not need to have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' or [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:sterben|sterben]]'' (\"to die\") all derive from the same [[Proto-Germanic]] root, ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterban\u0105|*sterban\u0105]]'' (\"die\"). ''Discus'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2'' (from the verb ''\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd'' \"to throw\"). A later and separate English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[medieval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').\n\nCognates also do not need to have similar forms: English ''[[wikt:father|father]]'', [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:p\u00e8re#French|p\u00e8re]]'', and Armenian [[wikt:\u0570\u0561\u0575\u0580|\u0570\u0561\u0575\u0580]] (''hayr'') all descend directly from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ph\u2082t\u1e17r''.\n\n==Across languages==\nExamples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''nag'' ([[Afrikaans]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''n\u00e1tt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''n\u00f3tt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), \u043d\u043e\u045c, ''no\u0107'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), \u043d\u043e\u0449, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''\u043d\u0456\u0447'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''\u043d\u043e\u0447'', ''noch''/''no\u010d'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''no\u010d'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''no\u0107'' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]]), \u03bd\u03cd\u03be, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''\u03bd\u03cd\u03c7\u03c4\u03b1''/''nychta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nox/nocte'' ([[Latin]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''nat\u00eb'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''nu\u00e8ch/nu\u00e8it'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]), ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]) and ''Naach'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), all meaning \"night\" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/n\u00f3k\u02b7ts|*n\u00f3k\u02b7ts]]}} \"night\".\n\nAnother Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''tora'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''astre''/''\u00e9toile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (ast\u0113r)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9''/''\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''astro/stella'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''aster'' ([[Latin]]) ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''astgh'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''Stern'' ([[German language|German]]), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''Scht\u00e4hn'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and Danish), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stj\u00e4rna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stj\u00f8rna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''set\u0101re'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''estela'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) ''estrella'' and ''astro'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''estrella'' [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], ''estrela'' and ''astro'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) and ''est\u00eare'' or ''st\u00eark'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2082st\u1e17r|*h\u2082st\u1e17r]]}} \"star\".\n\nThe [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645}} ''sal\u0101m'', the [[Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd}} ''shalom'', the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] ''shlama'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' (\"peace\") are also cognates, derived from the [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/\u0161al\u0101m-|*\u0161al\u0101m-]] \"peace\".\n\nCognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence.

For instance, while the Hebrew word {{Hebrew|\u05d7\u05d5\u05e6\u05e4\u05d4}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means \"impudence,\" its [[Classical Arabic]] cognate {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0635\u0627\u0641\u0629}} ''\u1e25a\u1e63\u0101fah'' means \"sound judgment.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J.

For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (<PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-]]'', \"to perceive, watch out for\") are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (<PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-]]'', \"to cut\"). In some cases, including this one, one cognate (\"skirt\") has an ultimate source in another language related to English,<ref>{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= skirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=skirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=early 14c., \"lower part of a woman's dress,\" from Old Norse ''skyrta'' \"shirt, a kind of kirtle\" }}</ref>  but the other one (\"shirt\") is native.<ref>{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= shirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=Old English ''scyrte'' \"skirt, tunic,\" from Proto-Germanic *''skurtjon'' \"a short garment\"  }}</ref>  That happened with many loanwords, such as ''skirt'' in this example, which was borrowed from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] during the [[Danelaw]].\n\nSometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' (\"head\"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a \"sh\" sound in French. Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native), ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch), and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.\n\nA word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called [[reborrowing]]. For example, the Greek word ''\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1'' (''kinima'', \"movement\") became French ''cin\u00e9ma'' (compare American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac'' (''sinema'', \"the art of film\", \"movie theater\"). In Greek, ''\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1'' (''kinima'', \"movement\") and ''\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac'' (''sinema'', \"filmmaking, cinema\") are now doublets.<ref>In fact, ''\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root, ''\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2'' (''kinimato\u03b3r\u00e1fos''), with the same two meanings as ''cin\u00e9ma''/''\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1'' (''tainia'').)</ref>\n\nA less obvious English-language doublet pair is ''[[wikt:grammar|grammar]]'' and ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]''.\n\n==False cognates==\n[[False cognates]] are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb ''hab\u0113re'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]). German ''haben'', like English ''have'', comes from PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kh\u2082py\u00e9-|*kh\u2082py\u00e9-]]'' 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin ''hab\u0113re'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*g\u02b0ab\u02b0'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.<ref>''[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]''</ref>\n\nLikewise, English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: ''much'' from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz]]'' < PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*me\u01f5-]]'' and ''mucho'' from Latin ''multum'' < PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ringe|first1=Don|title=A quick introduction to language change|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|website=Univ. of Pennsylvania: Linguistics 001 (Fall 2011)|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620051440/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|location=\u00b6 29|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language|Linguistics}}\n\n*[[Cognate object]]\n*[[Figura etymologica]]\n*[[Historical linguistics]]\n*[[Indo-European vocabulary]]\n*[[Interlingual homograph]]\n* [[wikt:Appendix:List of German cognates with English |List of German cognates with English]] (in Wiktionary)\n*[[Lists of words having different meanings in American and British English]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rub\u00e9n Mor\u00e1n (2011), 'Cognate Linguistics', Kindle Edition, Amazon.\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|cognate}}\n*[http://www.cognates.org/ Cognates.org]\n*[http://www.spanishcognates.org/ SpanishCognates.org]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cognate (Etymology)}}\n[[Category:Historical linguistics]]\n[[Category:Language comparison]]", "sha1": "guc94gsutjocxfg63qm82cctfi10v5s"}}, {"title": "Chromatography", "ns": "0", "id": "6329", "revision": {"id": "864185283", "parentid": "864182909", "timestamp": "2018-10-15T17:08:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "Classicwiki", "id": "18847693"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2A02:120B:C3E7:93C0:BCE5:7AFF:3A74:ED93|2A02:120B:C3E7:93C0:BCE5:7AFF:3A74:ED93]] ([[User talk:2A02:120B:C3E7:93C0:BCE5:7AFF:3A74:ED93|talk]]) to last revision by JCW-CleanerBot.

Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.\n\n==Chromatography terms==\n*The ''analyte'' is the substance to be separated during chromatography. It is also normally what is needed from the mixture.\n*''Analytical chromatography'' is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a [[Sample (material)|sample]].\n*A ''bonded phase'' is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing.\n*A ''chromatogram'' is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture.\n:[[File:Rt 5 9.png|300px|Chromatogram with unresolved peaks]] [[File:Rt 5 12.png|300px|Chromatogram with two resolved peaks]]\n:Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]], [[Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.\n*A ''chromatograph'' is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation, e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.\n*''Chromatography'' is a physical method of separation that distributes components to separate between two phases, one stationary (stationary phase), the other (the mobile phase) moving in a definite direction.\n*The ''eluate'' is the mobile phase leaving the column. This is also called effluent. \n*The ''eluent'' is the solvent that carries the analyte.\n*The ''eluite'' is the analyte, the eluted solute. \n*An ''[[eluotropic series]]'' is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.\n*An ''immobilized phase'' is a stationary phase that is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.\n*The ''mobile phase'' is the phase that moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.\n*''Preparative chromatography'' is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.\n*The ''retention time'' is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: [[Kovats retention index|Kovats' retention index]]\n*The ''sample'' is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.\n*The ''solute'' refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.\n*The ''solvent'' refers to any substance capable of solubilizing another substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in liquid chromatography.\n*The ''stationary phase'' is the substance fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the [[silica]] layer in [[Chromatography#Thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]\n* The ''detector'' refers to the instrument used for qualitative and quantitative detection of analytes after separation.\n  \nChromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If the matrix support, or stationary phase, is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non-polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.\n\n==Techniques by chromatographic bed shape==\n\n===Column chromatography===\n{{details|Column chromatography}}\nColumn chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365040819|title=Nomenclature for chromatography (IUPAC Recommendations 1993)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=65|issue=4|pages=819\u2013872|year=1993|last1=Ettre|first1=L.

This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.\n\nIn [[expanded bed adsorption]], a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.\n\n[[Phosphocellulose]] chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many DNA-binding proteins for phosphocellulose.  The stronger a protein's interaction with DNA, the higher the salt concentration needed to elute that protein.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Anfinsen, Christian B. |editor2=Edsall, John Tileston |editor3=Richards, Frederic Middlebrook |title=Advances in Protein Chemistry|isbn=978-0-12-034230-3 |year=1976|pages=6\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n===Planar chromatography===\n''Planar chromatography'' is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ([[paper chromatography]]) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ([[thin layer chromatography]]). Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific [[Retention factor]] (R<sub>f</sub>) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.\n\n====Paper chromatography====\n{{details|Paper chromatography}}\nPaper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]''. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of [[solvent]] and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of [[cellulose]], a [[Chemical polarity|polar substance]], and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.\n\n====Thin layer chromatography (TLC) ====\n{{details|Thin layer chromatography}}\nThin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals on the basis of their size and is similar to [[paper chromatography]]. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of [[adsorbent]] like [[silica gel]], [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat, inert [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/437068122|title=Handbook of Thin-Layer Chromatography|last=Bernard.|first=Fried,|date=2003|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|isbn=978-0824748661|oclc=437068122}}</ref> Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, [[HPTLC|high-performance TLC]] can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).\n\n==Displacement chromatography==\nThe basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:\nA molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) competes effectively for binding sites, and thus displaces all molecules with lesser affinities.<ref>[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography 101] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113736/http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html |date=15 September 2008 }}. Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737</ref>\nThere are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than \u201cpeaks\u201d. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.\n\n==Techniques by physical state of mobile phase==\n===Gas chromatography===<!-- This section is linked from [[Biodiesel]] -->\n{{details|Gas chromatography}}\nGas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column, which is typically \"packed\" or \"capillary\".  Packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography, being cheaper and easier to use and often giving adequate performance.   Capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used, especially for complex mixtures.  Both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials. Stainless steel and glass are the usual materials for packed columns and quartz or fused silica for capillary columns.\n\nGas chromatography is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 \u2013 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]]; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in [[biochemistry]], it is well suited for use in the [[petrochemical]], [[environmental monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], and [[Chemical industry|industrial chemical]] fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.\n\n===Liquid chromatography===\n[[File:Preparative HPLC.svg|thumb|400px|Preparative HPLC apparatus]]\nLiquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. It can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).\n\nIn HPLC the sample is forced by a liquid at high pressure (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a [[Monolithic HPLC column|porous monolithic layer]], or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 ([[octadecylsilyl]]) as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).\n\nSpecific techniques under this broad heading are listed below.\n\n==Affinity chromatography==\n{{details|Affinity chromatography}}\nAffinity chromatography<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilchek|first1=M.|last2=Chaiken|first2=I. |year=2000 |chapter=Chapter 1 An Overview of Affinity Chromatography |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-60327-261-2_1 |editor1-last=Bailon|editor1-first= P.|editor2-last=Ehrlich|editor2-first=G.K.|editor3-last=Fung|editor3-first=W.J.|editor4-last=Berthold|editor4-first=W. |title=Affinity Chromatography | url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781603272612 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |language=en |volume=147 |publisher=Humana Press |pages=1\u20136 |doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-261-2_1|isbn=978-1-60327-261-2}}</ref> is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of [[protein]]s bound to tags. These [[fusion protein]]s are labeled with compounds such as [[His-tag]]s, [[biotin]] or [[antigen]]s, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.\n\nAffinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.).  Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.\n\nHowever, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatography properties.  Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singh|first1=Naveen K. |last2=DSouza|first2=Roy N. |last3=Bibi|first3=Noor S. |last4= Fern\u00e1ndez-Lahore|first4=Marcelo |year=2015 |chapter=Chapter 16 Direct Capture of His6-Tagged Proteins Using Megaporous Cryogels Developed for Metal-Ion Affinity Chromatography |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-2447-9_16 |editor1-last=Reichelt|editor1-first=S. |title=Affinity Chromatography |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493924462 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |language=en |volume=1286 |pages=201\u2013212 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2447-9_16 |pmid=25749956 |isbn=978-1-4939-2447-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Gaberc-Porekar |first1= Vladka K.|last2= Menart |first2= Viktor|date=2001|title= Perspectives of immobilized-metal affinity chromatography|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165022X0100207X |journal=J Biochem Biophys Methods |volume=49 |issue= 1\u20133 |pages= 335\u2013360|doi= 10.1016/S0165-022X(01)00207-X}}</ref> is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (i.e. Dionex IMAC).  Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinity.\n\n===Supercritical fluid chromatography===\n{{details|Supercritical fluid chromatography}}\nSupercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.\n\n==Techniques by separation mechanism==\n\n===Ion exchange chromatography===\n{{details|Ion exchange chromatography}}\nIon exchange chromatography (usually referred to as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including [[anion]]s, [[cation]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an [[ion exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There are two types of ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander J|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-47131-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].\n\n===Size-exclusion chromatography===\n{{details|Size-exclusion chromatography}}\nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as ''gel permeation chromatography'' (GPC) or ''gel filtration chromatography'' and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).\nSmaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, \"polishing\" step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions.\n\n===Expanded bed adsorption chromatographic separation===\n{{details|Expanded bed adsorption}}\nAn expanded bed chromatographic adsorption (EBA) column for a biochemical separation process comprises a pressure equalization liquid distributor having a self-cleaning function below a porous blocking sieve plate at the bottom of the expanded bed, an upper part nozzle assembly having a backflush cleaning function at the top of the expanded bed, a better distribution of the feedstock liquor added into the expanded bed ensuring that the fluid passed through the expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed chromatographic separation column has advantages of increasing the separation efficiency of the expanded bed.\n\nExpanded-bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography is a convenient and effective technique for the capture of proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends on the characteristics of the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.\n\n==Special techniques==\n\n===Reversed-phase chromatography===\n{{main|Reversed-phase chromatography}}\nReversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first. Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate.\n\n===Hydrophobic interaction chromatography===\n\nHydrophobic interactions between proteins and the chromatographic matrix can be exploited to purify proteins. In hydrophobic interaction chromatography the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups. These groups can range from methyl, ethyl, propyl, octyl, or phenyl groups.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ninfa AJ, Ballou DP, Benore M | title = Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2010 }}</ref> At high salt concentrations, non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins \"interact\" with the hydrophobic groups; that is, both types of groups are excluded by the polar solvent (hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength). Thus, the sample is applied to the column in a buffer which is highly polar. The eluant is typically an aqueous buffer with decreasing salt concentrations, increasing concentrations of detergent (which disrupts hydrophobic interactions), or changes in pH.\n\nIn general, Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is advantageous if the sample is sensitive to pH change or harsh solvents typically used in other types of chromatography but not high salt concentrations. Commonly, it is the amount of salt in the buffer which is varied. In 2012, M\u00fcller and Franzreb described the effects of temperature on HIC using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with four different types of hydrophobic resin. The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 degrees to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2012.08.052| pmid = 22954746| title = Suitability of commercial hydrophobic interaction sorbents for temperature-controlled protein liquid chromatography under low salt conditions| journal = Journal of Chromatography A| volume = 1260| pages = 88\u201396| year = 2012| last1 = M\u00fcller| first1 = Tobias K.H| last2 = Franzreb| first2 = Matthias}}</ref> Using temperature to effect change allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money.\n\nIf high salt concentrations along with temperature fluctuations want to be avoided you can use a more hydrophobic to compete with your sample to elute it. [source] This so-called salt independent method of HIC showed a direct isolation of Human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from serum with satisfactory yield and used Beta-cyclodextrin as a competitor to displace IgG from the matrix.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2014.10.009| pmid = 25441076| title = Salt-independent hydrophobic displacement chromatography for antibody purification using cyclodextrin as supermolecular displacer| journal = Journal of Chromatography A| volume = 1369| pages = 98\u2013104| year = 2014| last1 = Ren| first1 = Jun| last2 = Yao| first2 = Peng| last3 = Chen| first3 = Jingjing| last4 = Jia| first4 = Lingyun}}</ref> This largely opens up the possibility of using HIC with samples which are salt sensitive as we know high salt concentrations precipitate proteins.\n[[File:GCxGC-TOFMS Analytical Dept Chemical Faculty GUT Gdansk.jpg | thumb | Two-dimensional chromatograph GCxGC-TOFMS at [[Faculty of Chemistry, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology|Chemical Faculty]] of [[Gda\u0144sk University of Technology|GUT]] [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]], 2016]]\n\n===Two-dimensional chromatography===\nIn some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical ([[chemical classification]]) properties.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds by [[two-dimensional chromatography]] that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography.\n\nThe sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate, developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90\u00b0 and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.\n\n===Simulated moving-bed chromatography===\n{{details|Simulated moving bed}}\nThe simulated moving bed (SMB) technique is a variant of high performance liquid chromatography; it is used to separate particles and/or chemical compounds that would be difficult or impossible to resolve otherwise. This increased separation is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely.\nIn the moving bed technique of preparative chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the sample inlet and the analyte exit positions are moved continuously, giving the impression of a moving bed.\nTrue moving bed chromatography (TMBC) is only a theoretical concept. Its simulation, SMBC is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement, which provides for sample and solvent feed, and also analyte and waste takeoff at appropriate locations of any column, whereby it allows switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction, the solvent entry in the opposite direction, whilst changing the analyte and waste takeoff positions appropriately as well.\n\n===Pyrolysis gas chromatography===\n[[Pyrolysis\u2013gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry]] is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry.\n\nPyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.\n\nBesides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.\n\n===Fast protein liquid chromatography===\n{{details|Fast protein liquid chromatography}}\nFast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), is a form of liquid chromatography that is often used to analyze or purify mixtures of proteins. As in other forms of chromatography, separation is possible because the different components of a mixture have different affinities for two materials, a moving fluid (the \"mobile phase\") and a porous solid (the stationary phase). In FPLC the mobile phase is an aqueous solution, or \"buffer\". The buffer flow rate is controlled by a positive-displacement pump and is normally kept constant, while the composition of the buffer can be varied by drawing fluids in different proportions from two or more external reservoirs. The stationary phase is a resin composed of beads, usually of cross-linked agarose, packed into a cylindrical glass or plastic column. FPLC resins are available in a wide range of bead sizes and surface ligands depending on the application.\n\n===Countercurrent chromatography===\n{{details|Countercurrent chromatography}}\n[[File:HPCCC system.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a HPCCC system]]\n\nCountercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. \nThe operating principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field to act on the column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.\n\n===Periodic counter-current chromatography===\n{{details|Periodic counter-current chromatography}}\n\nIn contrast to Countercurrent chromatography (see above), periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) uses a solid stationary phase and only a liquid mobile phase. It thus is much more similar to conventional [[affinity chromatography]] than to countercurrent chromatography. PCC uses multiple columns, which during the loading phase are connected in line. This mode allows for overloading the first column in this series without losing product, which already breaks through the column before the resin is fully saturated. The breakthrough product is captured on the subsequent column(s). In a next step the columns are disconnected from one another. The first column is washed and eluted, while the other column(s) are still being loaded. Once the (initially) first column is re-equilibrated, it is re-introduced to the loading stream, but as last column. The process then continues in a cyclic fashion.\n\n===Chiral chromatography===\nChiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. [[Chiral column chromatography|Chiral chromatography HPLC columns]] (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.\n\n===Aqueous normal-phase chromatography===\nAqueous normal-phase (ANP) chromatography is characterized by the elution behavior of classical normal phase mode (i.e. where the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase) in which water is one of the mobile phase solvent system components. It is distinguished from hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in that the retention mechanism is due largely to adsorption rather than partitioning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kulsing|first1=C|last2=Nolvachai|first2=Y|last3=Marriott|first3=PJ|last4=Boysen|first4=RI|last5=Matyska|first5=MT|last6=Pesek|first6=JJ|last7=Hearn|first7=MT|title=Insights into the origin of the separation selectivity with silica hydride adsorbents|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=19 February 2015|volume=119|issue=7|pages=3063\u20139|doi=10.1021/jp5103753|pmid=25656442}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin}}\n\n* {{Portal-inline|Chromatography}}\n*[[Affinity chromatography]]\n*[[Aqueous normal-phase chromatography]]\n*[[Binding selectivity]]\n*[[Chromatofocusing]]\n*[[Chromatography in blood processing]]\n*[[Chromatography software]]\n*[[Multicolumn countercurrent solvent gradient purification]] (MCSGP)\n*[[Purnell equation]]\n*[[Van Deemter equation]]\n*[[Weak affinity chromatography]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chromatography}}\n{{Wikibooks|School Science/Paper chromatography of amino acids}}\n*[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6504x0819.pdf IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography]\n*[http://www.vias.org/simulations/simusoft_peakoverlap.html Overlapping Peaks Program \u2013 Learning by Simulations]\n*[http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/chemvideo/index.htm Chromatography Videos \u2013 MIT OCW \u2013 Digital Lab Techniques Manual]\n*[http://www.mtc-usa.com/calculators_chrom.asp Chromatography Equations Calculators \u2013 MicroSolv Technology Corporation]\n\n{{chromatography| }}\n{{Separation processes}}\n{{Analytical chemistry}}\n{{pathology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical pathology]]\n[[Category:Chromatography| ]]\n[[Category:Biological techniques and tools]]\n[[Category:Russian inventions]]", "sha1": "cctugvv32rjlbpjszqd9xicyfy0fjyx"}}, {"title": "Clement Martyn Doke", "ns": "0", "id": "6330", "revision": {"id": "863377800", "parentid": "724638615", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T11:55:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cydebot", "id": "1215485"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot - Speedily moving category South African linguists to [[:Category:Linguists from South Africa]] per [[WP:CFDS|CFDS]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Use South African English|date=May 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Clement Martyn Doke\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1893|5|16|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Bristol]]\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|1980|2|24|1893|5|16|df=yes}}\n| death_place = \n}}\n'''Clement Martyn Doke''' (16 May 1893 in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]] \u2013 24 February 1980 in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]]) was a South African [[linguist]] working mainly on African languages. Realizing that the grammatical structures of [[Bantu languages]] are quite different from those of European languages, he was one of the first African linguists of his time to abandon the Euro-centric approach to language description for a more locally grounded one. A most prolific writer, he published a string of [[grammar]]s, several dictionaries, [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] work, and a history of Bantu linguistics.\n\n==Missionary in Lambaland==\nThe Doke family had been engaged in missionary activity for the [[Baptist Church]] for some generations. His father Reverend [[Joseph J. Doke]] left England and travelled to South Africa in 1882, where he met and married Agnes Biggs. They returned to England, where Clement was born as the third of four children. The family moved to New Zealand and eventually returned to South Africa in 1903, where they later on settled in [[Johannesburg]].\n\nAt the age of 18, Clement received a bachelor's degree from [[Transvaal University College]] in [[Pretoria]] (now the [[University of Pretoria]]). He decided to devote his life to missionary activity. In 1913, he accompanied his father on a tour of north-western [[Rhodesia]], to an area called Lambaland, now known as [[Ilamba]]. It is situated at the watershed of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Zambesi]] rivers, part of the district lay in Northern Rhodesia and part in the Belgian Congo State. The [[Cape-Cairo Railway]] threaded through its eastern portion; otherwise, travelling mostly had to be done on foot.\n\nThe Reverend William Arthur Phillips of the Nyasa Industrial Mission in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] had established a Baptist mission there in 1905, serving an area of {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}} and 50,000 souls. The Dokes were supposed to investigate, whether the mission in Lambaland could be taken over by the Baptist Union of South Africa. It was on this trip that Doke's father contracted enteric fever and died soon afterwards ([[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] attended the memorial service and addressed the congregation). Clement assumed his father's role.\n\nThe South African Baptists decided to take over Kafulafuta Mission, while its founder Reverend Phillips remained as superintendent. Clement Doke returned to Kafulafuta as missionary in 1914, followed by his sister Olive two years later.\n\n==The Lamba language==\nAt first, Clement Doke was frustrated by his inability to communicate with the [[Lamba language|Lamba]]. The only written material available at the time was a translation of Jonah and a collection of 47 hymns. Soon he mastered the language and published his first book ''Ifintu Fyakwe Lesa'' (The Things of God, a Primer of Scripture Knowledge) in 1917. He enrolled in Johannesburg as the extension of Transvaal University College for an MA degree. His thesis was published as ''The Grammar of the [[Lamba language]]''. The book is couched in traditional grammatical terms as Doke had not yet established his innovative method of analysis and description for the Bantu languages. His later ''Textbook of Lamba Grammar'' is far superior in this respect. \n\nClement Doke was also interested in [[ethnology]]. In 1931 he compiled ''The Lambas of Northern Rhodesia'', which remains one of the outstanding ethnographic descriptions of the peoples of Central Africa. For Doke, literacy was part of the evangelisation since people had to be able to read to appreciate the message of the Bible, but it was only after his retirement that he completed the translation of the Bible into Lamba. It was published under the title of ''Amasiwi AwaLesa'' (The Words of God) in 1959.\n\n==University of the Witwatersrand==\nIn 1919 Doke married Hilda Lehmann, who accompanied him back to Lambaland. They both contracted malaria during their work and she was forbidden to return to Lambaland. Clement Doke also realised that his field work couldn't continue much longer and left in 1921. He was recruited by the newly founded [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. In order to secure a qualification as a lecturer, the family moved to England, where he registered at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]]. His major languages were [[Lamba language|Lamba]] and [[Tshiluba language|Luba]], but as no suitable examiner was available, he eventually had to change his language to [[isiZulu|Zulu]].\n\nDoke took up his appointment in the new Department of Bantu Studies at the University of Witwatersrand in 1923. In 1925 he received his D. Litt. for his doctoral thesis ''The Phonetics of the Zulu Language'' and was promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1931 he was appointed to the Chair of Bantu Studies and thus headed the Department of Bantu Studies. The Department acted as a catalyst for the admission of Africans to the University: as early as 1925 a limited number were admitted to the vacation course in African Studies. Doke supported the appointment of [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] as member of the staff, as he believed a native speaker was essential for acquiring a language. This provoked a storm of criticism and controversy from the public. They both collaborated on the ''Zulu-English Dictionary'', first published in 1948. It is still one of the best examples of lexicography for any of the Bantu languages. \n\nAt the request of the government of Southern Rhodesia, Doke investigated the range of dialect diversity among the languages of the country and made recommendations for ''Unified [[Shona language|Shona]]''. This formed the basis for Standard Shona. He devised a unified [[orthography]] based on the [[Zezuru]], [[Ikalanga language|Karanga]] and [[Manyika]] dialects. However, Doke's orthography was never fully accepted and the South African government introduced an alternative, leaving Shona with two competing orthographies between 1935 and 1955.\n\nDuring his tenure Doke developed and promoted a method of [[Descriptive linguistics|linguistic analysis and description]] of the Bantu languages that was based upon the structure of these languages. The \"Dokean model\" continues to be one of the dominant models of linguistic description in Southern and Central Africa. His classification of the Bantu languages was for many years the dominant view of the interrelations among the African languages. He was also an early describer of Khoisan and Bantu click consonants, devising phonetic symbols for a number of them. \n\nDoke served the University of the Witwatersrand until his retirement in 1953. He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of letters by [[Rhodes University]] and the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1972.\n\nThe former missionary always remained devoted to the Baptist Church. He was elected President of the South African Baptist Union in 1949 and spent a year visiting churches and mission stations. He used his presidential address in condemning the recently established apartheid policy: ''I solemnly warn the Government that the spirit behind their [[apartheid]] legislation, and the way in which they are introducing discriminatory measures of all types today, will bring disaster upon this fair land of ours.''\n\n==Selected publications==\n*''Ifintu Fyakwe Lesa'' (The Things of God, a Primer of Scripture Knowledge in Lamba), 1917.\n*''The Lambas of Northern Rhodesia: A Study of their Customs and Beliefs''.

He studied at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and at the [[University of Greifswald]]. In 1905 he became professor at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] in [[Berlin]]. On 5 May 1933 he became a member of the [[Nazi Party]].\n\n==Works==\nHis most notable work was developing comparative [[grammar]] studies of the [[Bantu languages]], building on the pioneering work of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek|Wilhelm Bleek]]. In his work, Meinhof looked at the common [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] to determine similarities and differences.\n\nIn his work, Meinhof looked at [[noun class]]es with all Bantu languages having at least 10 classes and with 22 classes of nouns existing throughout the Bantu languages, though his definition of noun class differs slightly from the accepted one, considering the plural form of a word as belonging to a different class from the singular form (thus leading, for example, to consider a language like French as having four classes instead of two). While no language has all 22 (later: 23) classes active, [[Venda language|Venda]] has 20, [[Lozi language|Lozi]] has 18, and [[Ganda language#Noun classes|Ganda]] has 16 or 17 (depending on whether the locative class 23 ''e-'' is included). All Bantu languages have a noun class specifically for humans (sometimes including other animate beings).\n\nMeinhof also examined other African languages, including groups classified at the time as [[Kordofanian languages|Kordofanian]], [[Khoisan languages|Bushman]], [[Khoikhoi]], and [[Hamitic languages|Hamitic]].\n\nMeinhof developed a comprehensive classification scheme for African languages. His classification was the standard one for many years (Greenberg 1955:3). It was replaced by those of [[Joseph Greenberg]] in 1955 and in 1963.\n\nIn 1902, Meinhof made recordings of East African music. These are among the first recordings made of traditional [[African music]].\n\n==Controversial views==\nIn 1912, Carl Meinhof published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (The Languages of the Hamites). He used the term [[Hamitic]]. Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this in spite of earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston demonstrating that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact [[Nilotic languages]] with numerous similarities in vocabulary with other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n==Family==\nCarl Meinhof was the great-uncle (the brother of the grandfather) of [[Ulrike Meinhof]], a founding member of the German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), a [[left-wing]] militant group, which operated in [[West Germany]] in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Greenberg, Joseph H. 1955.

Leaves are [[exstipulate]] alternate simple [[Leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or palmately compound. The flowers are [[unisexual]], with male and female flowers on different plants (dioecious) or on the same plant (monoecious).

watermelons (''[[Citrullus lanatus]]''), sponge gourds (''[[Luffa aegyptiaca]]''), snake melons (''faqqous'', ''Cucumis melo'' flexuosus group), ''adzhur'' melons (''C. melo'' adzhur group), and bottle gourds (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]''). Cucurbits are represented in 23 of the 134 mosaics containing images of crop plants, a surprisingly high frequency of 17%. Several of the cucurbit images have not been found elsewhere, suggesting a diverse and highly developed local horticulture of cucurbits in Israel during the Byzantine era. Representations of mature sponge gourds are found in widespread localities, suggestive of the high value accorded to cleanliness and hygiene.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Avital|first=Anat|last2=Paris|first2=Harry S.|date=2014-08-01|title=Cucurbits depicted in Byzantine mosaics from Israel, 350\u2013600 ce|url=https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/114/2/203/2769032|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=114|issue=2|pages=203\u2013222|doi=10.1093/aob/mcu106|pmid=24948671|pmc=4111391|issn=0305-7364}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and pronunciation==\nThe name ''Cucurbitaceae'' comes to [[international scientific vocabulary]] from [[New Latin]], from ''[[Cucurbita]]'', the [[type genus]], + ''[[wikt:-aceae#Suffix|-aceae]]'',<ref name=\"MWU\">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref> a standardized [[suffix]] for plant family names in modern taxonomy.

The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free. A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer or a [[bicycle handlebar]]) that is too small to contain a normal-sized keyboard.\n\nA chorded keyboard minus the board, typically designed to be used while held in the hand, is called a [[keyer]]. [[Douglas Engelbart]] introduced the chorded keyset as a computer interface in 1968 at what is often called \"[[The Mother of All Demos]]\".\n\n==Principles of operation==\n[[Image:Septambic key numbering.jpg|thumb|An ergonomic chorded keyboard without the board is known as a [[keyer]].]]\nEach key is mapped to a number and then can be mapped to a corresponding letter or command. By pressing two or more keys together the user can generate many combinations. In Engelbart's original mapping, he used five keys: 1,2,4,8,16. The keys were mapped as follows: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, and so on. If the user pressed keys 1 + 2 = 3 simultaneously, and then released the keys, the letter \"c\" appeared. Unlike pressing a chord on a piano, the chord is recognized only after all the keys or mouse buttons are released. Since Engelbart introduced the keyset, several different designs have been developed based on similar concepts.\n\nAs a crude example, each finger might control one key which corresponds to one [[bit]] in a [[byte]], so that using seven keys and seven fingers, one could enter any [[character (computing)|character]] in the [[ASCII]] set\u2014if the user could remember the binary codes. Due to the small number of keys required, chording is easily adapted from a desktop to mobile environment.\n\nPractical devices generally use simpler chords for common characters (''e.g.,'' [[Baudot code|Baudot]]), or may have ways to make it easier to remember the chords (''e.g.,'' [[Microwriter]]<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009 | first1 = C | last1 = Rainey | first2 = P | last2 = Rainey | first3 = M | last3 = Rainey |url = http://sites.google.com/site/cykeybellaire/cykey-codecard |title= Bellaire Electronics, Cykey, Microwriter, Agenda |publisher= Google |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>), but the same principles apply. These portable devices first became popular with the [[wearable computer]] movement in the 1980s.\n\n[[Thad Starner]] from Georgia Institute of Technology and others published numerous studies<ref>{{cite web | url = http://edgarmatias.com/papers/ic93/ | title= Half-QWERTY: A One-handed Keyboard Facilitating Skill Transfer From QWERTY |publisher=Edgar Matias |date=1991-03-21 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISWC.2004.19 |title=Expert Chording Text Entry on the Twiddler One-Handed Keyboard | publisher = Computer | date= 2004-10-31 | accessdate= 2011-10-24 | doi=10.1109/ISWC.2004.19 | journal=Eighth International Symposium on Wearable Computers|hdl=1853/58 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISWC.2005.49 |title=The Impacts of Limited Visual Feedback on Mobile Text Entry for the Twiddler and Mini-QWERTY Keyboards |publisher=Computer | date =2005-10-18 |accessdate= 2011-10-24 |doi=10.1109/ISWC.2005.49 |journal=Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC'05)}}</ref> showing that two handed chorded text entry was faster and yielded fewer errors than on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard. Currently [[stenotype machine]]s hold the record for fastest word entry.  Many stenotype users can reach 300 words per minute. However, stenographers typically train for three years before reaching professional levels of speed and accuracy.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known chord keyboard was part of the \"five-needle\" [[telegraph]] operator station, designed by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]] and [[William Fothergill Cooke|Cooke]] in 1836, in which any two of the five needles could point left or right to indicate letters on a grid. It was designed to be used by untrained operators (who would determine which keys to press by looking at the grid), and was not used where trained telegraph operators were available.\n\nThe first widespread use of a chord keyboard was in the [[stenotype]] machine used by court reporters, which was invented in 1868 and is still in use. The output of the stenotype was originally a phonetic code that had to be transcribed later (usually by the same operator who produced the original output), rather than arbitrary text\u2014automatic conversion software is now commonplace.\n\nIn 1874, the five-bit [[Baudot code|Baudot telegraph code]] and a matching 5-key chord keyboard was designed to be used with the operator forming the codes manually. The code is optimized for speed and low wear: chords were chosen so that the most common characters used the simplest chords. But telegraph operators were already using typewriters with QWERTY keyboards to \"copy\" received messages, and at the time it made more sense to build a typewriter that could generate the codes automatically, rather than making them learn to use a new input device.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nSome early [[keypunch]] machines used a keyboard with 12 labeled keys to punch the correct holes in paper cards. The numbers 0 through 9 were represented by one punch; 26 letters were represented by combinations of two punches, and symbols were represented by combinations of two or three punches.\n\n[[Image:Braille Writer.jpg|thumb|right|A [[braille]] keyboard]]\n[[Braille]] (a writing system for the blind) uses either 6 or 8 tactile 'points' from which all letters and numbers are formed. When [[Louis Braille]] invented it, it was produced with a needle holing successively all needed points in a cardboard sheet.  In 1892, [[Frank Haven Hall]], superintendent of the Illinois Institute for the Education of the Blind, created the Hall Braille Writer, which was like a typewriter with 6 keys, one for each dot in a braille cell.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://mycountryisamerica.com/ingenuity.aspx |accessdate= 25 February 2012 | work= America! The Greatest Country in the History of Mankind |title=Ingenuity}}</ref> The [[Perkins Brailler]], first manufactured in 1951, uses a 6-key chord keyboard (plus a spacebar) to produce braille output, and has been very successful as a mass market affordable product. Braille, like Baudot, uses a number symbol and a shift symbol, which may be repeated for shift lock, to fit numbers and upper case into the 63 codes that 6 bits offer.\n\nAfter World War II, with the arrival of electronics for reading chords and looking in tables of \"codes\", the postal [[sorting office]]s started to research chordic solutions to be able to employ people other than trained and expensive typists. In 1954, an important concept was discovered: chordic production is easier to master when the production is done at the release of the keys instead of when they are pressed.\n\nResearchers at [[IBM]] investigated chord keyboards for both typewriters and computer data entry as early as 1959, with the idea that it might be faster than touch-typing if some chords were used to enter whole words or parts of words. A 1975 design by [[IBM Fellow]] [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nat Rochester]] had 14 keys that were dimpled on the edges as well as the top, so one finger could press two adjacent keys for additional combinations.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Chord Keyboard |author=Nathaniel Rochester |date=December 1978 |work=IEEE Computer|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|number=4,042,777|country=US|title=One-handed keyboard and its control means}}</ref>  Their results were inconclusive, but research continued until at least 1978.\n\n[[Doug Engelbart]] began experimenting with keysets to use with the mouse in the mid 1960s.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/keyset.html | title = Firsts | contribution = Keyset | publisher = Doug Engelbart institute}}.</ref> In a famous 1968 [[The Mother of All Demos|demonstration]],<ref>{{cite web | url =http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html | first =Doug | last = Engelbart | title = Demo |publisher= Stanford |date=1968-12-09 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> Engelbart introduced a computer human interface that included the [[QWERTY]] keyboard, a three button [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], and a five key keyset. Engelbart used the keyset with his left hand and the mouse with his right to type text and enter commands. The mouse buttons marked selections and confirmed or aborted commands.\n\nUsers in Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center at [[SRI International|SRI]] became proficient with the mouse and keyset. In the 1970s the funding Engelbart's group received from the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) was cut and many key members of Engelbart's team went to work for [[Xerox PARC]] where they continued to experiment with the mouse and keyset. Keychord sets were used at Xerox PARC in the early 1980s, along with mice, [[GUI]]s, on the Xerox Star and Alto workstations. A one button version of the mouse was incorporated into the [[Apple Macintosh]] but [[Steve Jobs]] decided against incorporating the chorded keyset.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Philips]] Research labs at [[Redhill, Surrey]] did a brief study{{Citation needed| date =January 2008}} into small, cheap keyboards for entering text on a telephone. One solution used a grid of hexagonal keys with symbols inscribed into dimples in the keys that were either in the center of a key, across the boundary of two keys, or at the joining of three keys. Pressing down on one of the dimples would cause either one, two or three of the hexagonal buttons to be depressed at the same time, forming a chord that would be unique to that symbol. With this arrangement, a nine button keyboard with three rows of three hexagonal buttons could be fitted onto a telephone and could produce up to 33 different symbols. By choosing widely separated keys, one could employ one dimple as a 'shift' key to allow both letters and numbers to be produced. With eleven keys in a 3/4/4 arrangement, 43 symbols could be arranged allowing for lowercase text, numbers and a modest number of punctuation symbols to be represented along with a 'shift' function for accessing uppercase letters. While this had the advantage of being usable by untrained users via 'hunt and peck' typing and requiring one less key switch than a conventional 12 button keypad, it had the disadvantage that some symbols required three times as much force to depress them as others which made it hard to achieve any speed with the device. That solution is still alive and proposed by Fastap and Unitap among others, and a commercial phone has been produced and promoted in Canada during 2006.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n==Standards==\nHistorically, the [[Baudot code|baudot]] and [[braille]] keyboards were standardized to some extent, but they are unable to replicate the full character set of a modern keyboard. Braille comes closest, as it has been extended to eight bits.\n\nThe only proposed modern standard, [[GKOS]] (or Global Keyboard Open Standard)<ref>{{cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170114134215/http://gkos.com:80/gkos/demo/ |title=GKOS Demo |publisher= MB net | location = [[Finland|FI]] | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}</ref> can support most characters and functions found on a computer keyboard but has had little commercial development. There is, however, a GKOS keyboard application available for iPhone since May 8, 2010, for Android since October 3, 2010 and for MeeGo Harmattan since October 27, 2011.\n\n==Open-source designs==\n[[Image:Chording Keyboard.png|thumb|A 104-key USB keyboard adapted into a chording keyboard.

With a configuration file, any joystick or gamepad can be turned into a chorded keyboard. This design philosophy was decided on to lower the cost of building devices, and in turn lower the entry barrier to becoming familiar with chorded keyboards. Macro keys, and multiple modes are also easily implemented with a user space driver.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://joy2chord.sourceforge.net/ | title = Joy2chord |publisher= Source forge | accessdate= 2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial devices==\n\nOne minimal chordic keyboard example is Edgar Matias' Half-Qwerty keyboard described in patent {{patent|US|5288158}} circa 1992 that produces the letters of the missing half when the user simultaneously presses the space bar along with the mirror key. INTERCHI '93 published a study by Matias, MacKenzie and Buxton showing that people who have already learned to touch-type can quickly recover 50 to 70% of their two-handed typing speed.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://edgarmatias.com/papers/ic93/index.html | title=Half-QWERTY: A One-handed Keyboard Facilitating Skill Transfer From QWERTY |author1=Matias, Edgar |author2=MacKenzie, I.

It is implemented on two popular mobile phones, each provided with software disambiguation, which allows users to avoid using the space-bar.\n\n[[Keyer|\"Multiambic\" keyers]] for use with wearable computers were invented in Canada in the 1970s. Multiambic keyers are similar to chording keyboards but without the board, in that the keys are grouped in a cluster for being handheld, rather than for sitting on a flat surface.\n\nChording keyboards are also used as portable but two handed input devices for the [[visually impaired]] (either combined with a [[refreshable braille display]] or vocal synthesis). Such keyboards use a minimum of seven keys, where each key corresponds to an individual [[braille]] point, except one key which is used as a spacebar. In some applications, the spacebar is used to produce additional chords which enable the user to issue editing commands, such as moving the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]], or deleting words. Note that the number of points used in braille computing is not 6, but 8, as this allows the user, among other things, to distinguish between small and capital letters, as well as identify the position of the cursor. As a result, most newer chorded keyboards for braille input include at least nine keys.\n\nTouch screen chordic keyboards are available to [[smartphone]] users as an optional way of entering text. As the number of keys is low the button areas can be made bigger and easier to hit on the small screen. The most common letters do not necessarily require chording as is the case with the GKOS keyboard optimised layouts (Android app) where the twelve most frequent characters only require single keys.\n\n===Historical===\nThe WriteHander,<ref>{{Citation | url = http://widebill.com/InputSources.html#anchor669460 | publisher = Wide Bill | title = Input sources}}.</ref> a 12-key chord keyboard from NewO Company, appeared in 1978 issues of ROM Magazine, an early microcomputer applications magazine.\n\nAnother early commercial model was the six-button [[Microwriter]], designed by [[Cy Endfield]] and Chris Rainey, and first sold in 1980. Microwriting is the system of chord keying and is based on a set of mnemonics. It was designed only for right-handed use.\n\nThe [[BAT keyboard|BAT]] is a 7-key hand-sized device from Infogrip, and has been sold since 1985. It provides one key for each finger and three for the thumb.  It is proposed for the hand which does not hold the mouse, in an exact continuation of Engelbart's vision.\n\n===Modern===\nModern examples of chorded keyboards include [[TipTapSpeech]] (using Engelbart's original mapping<ref>{{Citation | last = Landau | first = Valerie | publisher = Word press | title = Engelbart using his 1969 keyset with TipTap.mobi's prototype for interfacing it with an iPad | url = http://valerielandau.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/engelbart-typing-on-the-ipad-with-the-chorded-keyset/ | date = 2010-08-10}}.</ref>), the GKOS keyboard, the [[FrogPad]], the In10did method, the EkaPad, TextFaster<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.textfaster.com/ | title = TextFaster iPhone | accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> and HotTyper.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://sites.google.com/site/hottyper1/ |title=HotTyper |publisher= Google sites | accessdate= 2011-10-24}}</ref> Some of them are intended for tiny [[tablet computer]]s and wireless mobile terminals, many of them are additionally available as apps on Apple's [[iOS]] devices.

CyKey (pronounced sai-ki) is named after the Microwriter chord system's co-inventor [[Cy Endfield]], who died in 1995 but the name also reflects its intuitive nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n====SiWriter====\nThe SiWriter is an app for the iPad and iPhone which uses a close variant of the microwriter chording system developed by Cy Enfield. It is available via the Apple app store. More information can be found at <ref>{{cite web|url=http://siwriter.co.uk  |title=SiWriter.co.uk }}</ref>  The system is let down by the lack of haptic feedback - you can't tell if your fingers are in the right place without looking, but you get better with practice. The finger pad positions are adjustable to fit your hand size. It also works for left handed users and has a live speech output facility that could be helpful for people with speech impairments.\n\n====GKOS and ComboKey====\nThe '''GKOS'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gkos.com/ |title=GKOS keyboard |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> is a 6-key keyboard with a different signs and commands allocation of the 63 different chords in order to provide all PC keyboard functions and to make entering letters and numbers lighter by having to press fewer keys simultaneously. The ''6 physical keys'' are intended to be on the back of the device and to be operated with the six free fingers of two hands holding the device<ref>[http://gkos.com/gkos/gkos-how-to-type.php How to type on GKOS]</ref>. Another option is to have ''virtual GKOS keys'' positioned towards the sides of a touch sensitive screen. This GKOS for thumbs has additional keys to enable all combos by only one keypress per hand. GKOS iPhone, Android phone/tablet and MeeGo Harmattan applications use this principle.\n\nLater, GKOS has been further developed under name '''ComboKey'''<ref>[http://combokey.com ComboKey for Smartphones]</ref> to better suit the touch screens of smartphones. There is an Android keyboard application [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.combokey.plus ComboKey Plus] enabling e.g. one-hand typing.\n\n====EkaPad====\nThe EkaPad<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ekatetra.com/products/ekapad.html | title = Products | publisher = Eka tetra | contribution = EkaPad}}.</ref> is a 12-key chorded keyboard operated with the four fingers of one hand. It is supported on the thumb. With the 9 main keys, (operated by the index, middle, and ring fingers), 2 prefix keys and one delete key, the EkaPad can produce all the inputs of a standard qwerty keyboard with one, two, and a few three finger chords. For some characters one or two prefix chords are required.  9 main keys (3\u00d73 matrix) can produce a total of 511 chords. With each of the three fingers limited to its own row, 229 chords are possible with 3 fingers. EkaPad uses 66 of these accessible chords. One and two finger chords produce about 85% of American English; with an additional prefix chord about 97%. In addition, the EkaPad can store 100 text strings and 100 keyboard shortcuts.  Like many other chorded keyboards, it can be used with one hand.\n\nEkaPads are no longer manufactured at this writing.\n\n====FrogPad====\nThe [[FrogPad]] is a 20-key chorded keyboard about the size of a numeric keypad that can be used with one hand, and is optimized by character frequency. 85% of average keystrokes in English text can be typed without chording, and chords are limited to 2 fingers.\n\n====Decatxt====\nThe Decatxt keyboard uses the IN10DID 10 key chording method[29] (pronounced \"intended\"), and is currently on Amazon. It is a wireless one-handed chord keyboard that places two keys under each finger in order to utilize one hand for typing.  Typically only two fingers are needed for any operations. Each key is essentially a shift key so that with ten keys, there are ten single keystrokes and dozens of two and three key combinations. The alphabet is produced with a single press for ten letters or by shifting with either thumb for sixteen more. Changing modes, such as number lock, can make other input such as numbers, provided with a single keystroke. This avoids complex chords while providing enough keystrokes for efficient typing and allows for some unique implementations such as typing with gloves or on a steering wheel. A video game controller called the X-SKIN, using this system, was expected to be commercially available by 2010[citation needed] to help make Morphs popular on console systems and ease entry of common data such as a username and password, but the USB device was never made commercially available. The IN10DID chording system can be applied in  single hand configurations, two handed or with one key at a time if desired. Claimed advantages of the IN10DID method are the diversity of devices, limited motion and simple chords.\n\n====Twiddler====\nThe Twiddler<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twiddler.tekgear.com/ |title=Twiddler3 |publisher=TekGear|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}</ref> is a fully featured 16-key keyboard (plus mouse) designed to fit in the palm of one hand. It was originally introduced in the early 1990s by Handykey and is currently being produced by Tek Gear (Tek Gear acquired Handykey on April 30, 2008). It is popular among [[wearable computer]] researchers and hobbyists due to its ease of use, large community of users, and active support by the manufacturer.  Every single and multi-key chord on the Twiddler can be customized by the end user.  The Twiddler comes standard with an \"A, B, C, D\" chord set, with TabSpace and other chord sets available.  Chords are not limited to single keystrokes - multiple keystrokes can be sent with a single chord press. An example of this is an email address or address block can be typed by pressing just one chord.  The efficiency gained by using multi-character chords have novice Twiddler users typing at 47 WPM while experts can burst up to 130 WPM.<ref>{{cite web|last=Starner|first=Thad|title=Mobile Text Entry Research|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Thad.Starner/030_research.htm|publisher=Georgia Tech|accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref>\n====ASETNIOP====\nASETNIOP<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/asetniop-chorded-keyboard-concept/24477/|title= ASETNIOP concept designed to make touch typing on a touchscreen a mite easier | publisher = Gizmag}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.todaysiphone.com/2012/10/asetniop-invisible-keyboard-aims-to-get-you-touch-typing-on-the-ipad/|title=ASETNIOP invisible keyboard aims to get you touch-typing on the iPad|publisher=todaysiphone.com}}</ref> is a [[virtual keyboard]] based on chords that appeared in 2012.

The main constituents of the general molecular composition of the cell includes: proteins and lipids which are either free flowing or [[membrane]] bound, along with different internal [[cellular compartment|compartments]] known as [[organelle]]s. This environment of the cell is made up of [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] and [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] regions which allows for the exchange of the above-mentioned molecules and ions. The hydrophilic regions of the cell are mainly on the inside and outside of the cell, while the hydrophobic regions are within the [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] of the cell membrane. The cell membrane consists of lipids and proteins which accounts for its hydrophobicity as a result of being non-polar substances.<ref name=\":0\" /> Therefore, in order for these molecules to participate in reactions, within the cell, they need to be able to cross this membrane layer to get into the cell. They accomplish this process of gaining access to the cell via: [[osmotic pressure]], [[diffusion]], concentration gradients, and membrane channels. Inside of the cell are extensive internal sub-cellular membrane-bounded compartments called organelles.\n\n===Organelles ===\nCells contains specialized sub-cellular compartments including [[cell membrane]], [[cytoplasm]] and [[ribosome]]s. See [[organelle]].\n\n==Processes==\n===Growth and development ===\nThe growth process of the cell does not refer to the size of the cell, but instead the density of the number of cells present in the organism at a given time. [[Cell growth]] pertains to the increase in the number of cells present in an organism as it grows and develops; as the organism gets larger so too does the number of cells present. Cells are the foundation of all organisms, they are the fundamental unit of life. The growth and development of the cell are essential for the maintenance of the host, and survival of the organisms. For this process the cell goes through the steps of the [[cell cycle]] and development which involves cell growth, [[DNA replication]], [[cell division]], regeneration, specialization, and [[cell death]]. The cell cycle is divided into four distinct phases, G1, S, G2, and M. The G phases \u2013 which is the cell growth phase - makes up approximately 95% of the cycle.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Becker's World of the Cell|last = Hardin|first = Jeff|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-321-71602-6|location = |pages = }}</ref> The proliferation of cells is instigated by progenitors, the cells then differentiate to become specialized, where specialized cells of the same type aggregate to form tissues, then organs and ultimately systems.<ref name=\":0\" /> The G phases along with the S phase \u2013 DNA replication, damage and repair - are considered to be the interphase portion of the cycle. While the M phase ([[mitosis]] and [[cytokinesis]]) is the cell division portion of the cycle.<ref name=\":1\" /> The cell cycle is regulated by a series of signalling factors and complexes such as [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s and [[p53]], to name a few. When the cell has completed its growth process, and if it is found to be damaged or altered it undergoes cell death, either by [[apoptosis]] or [[necrosis]], to eliminate the threat it cause to the organism's survival.\n\n===Other cellular processes===\n*[[Active transport]] and [[Passive transport]] - Movement of [[molecules]] into and out of cells.\n*[[Autophagy]] - The process whereby cells \"eat\" their own internal components or [[Microorganism|microbial]] invaders.\n*[[Cell adhesion|Adhesion]] - Holding together cells and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n*Cell movement - [[Chemotaxis]], [[Muscle contraction|contraction]], [[cilia]] and [[Flagellum|flagella]].\n*[[Cell signaling]] - Regulation of cell behavior by signals from outside.\n*[[Cell division|Division]] - By which cells reproduce either by [[mitosis]] (to produce clones of the parent cell) or [[Meiosis]] (to produce [[haploid]] [[gametes]])\n*[[DNA repair]] - [[Cell death]] and cell [[senescence]].\n*[[Metabolism]] - [[Glycolysis]], [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[photosynthesis]], and [[chemosynthesis]].\n*[[Cell signaling|Signalling]] - The process by which the activities in the cell are regulated.\n*[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] and [[Splicing (genetics)|mRNA splicing]] - [[Gene]] expression.\n\n==Notable cell biologists==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n*[[Jean Baptiste Carnoy]]\n*[[Peter Agre]]\n*[[G\u00fcnter Blobel]]\n*[[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]]\n*[[Geoffrey M.

[[CBC News]], 1 July 2017.</ref> Treated as a marker of upper-class prestige in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th, Canadian dainty was marked by the use of some features of [[British English]] pronunciation, resulting in an accent similar to the [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] known in the United States.<ref name=dainty /> This accent faded in prominence following [[World War II]], when it became stigmatized as pretentious, and is now almost never heard in contemporary Canadian life outside of archival recordings used in film, television or radio documentaries.<ref name=dainty />\n\n== Spelling tendencies ==\nCanadian spelling of the English language combines British and American conventions.\n[[File:International English Spelling.png|thumb|alt=Canadian spelling in comparison with American and British spelling.|Canadian spelling in comparison with American and British spelling.]]\n* Words such as ''real'''ize''''' and ''paral'''yze''''' are usually spelled with ''-ize'' or ''-yze'' rather than ''-ise'' or ''-yse''. (The etymological convention that verbs derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] roots are spelled with -ize and those from [[Latin]] with -ise is preserved in that practice.<ref>Sir Ernest Gowers, ed., ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'', 2nd ed. (Oxford: OUP, 1965), 314.</ref>)\n* French-derived words that in American English end with ''-or'' and ''-er'', such as ''col'''or''''' or ''cent'''er''''', often retain British spellings (''col'''our''''' and ''cent'''re''''').\n* While the United States uses the Anglo-French spelling ''defen'''se''''' and ''offen'''se''''' (noun), most Canadians use the British spellings ''defen'''ce''''' and ''offen'''ce'''''. (Note that ''defen'''sive''''' and ''offen'''sive''''' are universal.)\n* Some nouns, as in British English, take ''-ice'' while matching verbs take ''-ise''&nbsp;\u2013 for example, ''pract'''ice''''' and ''licen'''ce''''' are nouns while ''pract'''ise''''' and ''licen'''se''''' are the respective corresponding verbs. (Note that ''adv'''ice''''' and ''adv'''ise''''' are universal across all forms of English in this respect.)\n* Canadian spelling sometimes retains the British practice of doubling consonants when adding suffixes to words even when the final syllable (before the suffix) is not stressed. Compare Canadian (and British) ''trave'''ll'''ed'', ''counse'''ll'''ing'', and ''marve'''ll'''ous'' (more often than not in Canadian while always doubled in British) to American ''trave'''l'''ed, counse'''l'''ing,'' and ''marve'''l'''ous''. In American English, such consonants are only doubled when stressed; thus, for instance, ''contro'''ll'''able'' and ''enthra'''ll'''ing'' are universal. (Note that both Canadian and British English use ''ballo'''t'''ed'' and ''profi'''t'''ing''.<ref name=\"CanadianOxford\">{{cite book\n| title     = The Canadian Oxford Dictionary\n| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n| year      = 2001\n| location  = Toronto, Ontario\n| author1   = Oxford Press\n| author2   = Katherine Barber\n| isbn      = 0-19-541731-3\n}}</ref>)\n* In other cases, Canadians and Americans differ from British spelling, such as in the case of nouns like ''curb'', ''tire'', and ''aluminum'',<ref>The Grammarist, \"Aluminium vs. aluminum\". Retrieved 2 June 2018. available at: http://grammarist.com/spelling/aluminium-aluminum/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620073205/http://grammarist.com/spelling/aluminium-aluminum/ |date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> which in British English are spelled ''kerb'', ''tyre'', and ''aluminium'' {{crossref|selfref=no|(See below for an explanation of the Canadian spelling of ''tire''.)}}\n\nCanadian spelling conventions can be partly explained by Canada's trade history. For instance, the British spelling of the word ''cheque'' probably relates to Canada's once-important ties to British financial institutions.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Canada's [[automobile]] industry, on the other hand, has been dominated by American firms from its inception, explaining why Canadians use the American spelling of ''tire'' (hence, \"[[Canadian Tire]]\") and American terminology for automobiles and their parts (for example, ''truck'' instead of ''lorry'', ''gasoline'' instead of ''petrol'', ''trunk'' instead of ''boot'').<ref name=\"CanadianOxford\" />\n\nCanada's political history has also had an influence on Canadian spelling. Canada's first [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], [[John A. Macdonald]], once advised the [[Governor General of Canada]] to issue an [[order-in-council]] directing that government papers be written in the British style.<ref>Richard Gwyn, ''John A.: The Man Who Made Us'', ([Place of publication not listed]: Random House Canada), 2007, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nA contemporary reference for formal Canadian spelling is the spelling used for [[Hansard]] transcripts of the [[Parliament of Canada]] {{crossref|selfref=no|(see ''The Canadian Style'' in [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below)}}.

Controversy around this issue was frequent. When the ''Gage Dictionary'' finally adopted standard Canadian spelling, the ''Star'' followed suit. Some publishers, e.g. ''[[Maclean's]]'', continue to prefer American spellings.\n\n== Dictionaries ==\n\nThe first Canadian dictionaries of Canadian English were edited by Walter Spencer Avis and published by [[Gage Educational Publishing Company|Gage]] Ltd. The ''Beginner's Dictionary'' (1962), the ''Intermediate Dictionary'' (1964) and, finally, the ''Senior Dictionary'' (1967) were milestones in Canadian English lexicography. In November 1967 [[A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles]] (DCHP) was published and completed the first edition of Gage Publishing's Dictionary of Canadian English Series. The DCHP documents the historical development of Canadian English words that can be classified as \"Canadianisms\". It therefore includes words such as mukluk, Canuck, and bluff, but does not list common core words such as desk, table or car. Many secondary schools in Canada use the graded dictionaries. The dictionaries have regularly been updated since: the ''Senior Dictionary'' was renamed ''Gage Canadian Dictionary''. Its fifth edition was printed beginning in 1997. Gage was acquired by Thomson Nelson around 2003. The latest editions were published in 2009 by [[HarperCollins]]. On 17 March 2017 a second edition of DCHP, the online [[Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles 2]] (DCHP-2) was published. DCHP-2 incorporates the c. 10,000 lexemes from DCHP-1 and adds c. 1300 novel meanings or 1002 lexemes to the documented lexicon of Canadian English.\n\nIn 1997, the ''ITP Nelson Dictionary of the Canadian English Language'' was another product, but has not been updated since.\n\nIn 1998, Oxford University Press produced a [[Canadians|Canadian]] English dictionary, after five years of lexicographical research, entitled ''The Oxford Canadian Dictionary''. A second edition, retitled ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', was published in 2004. Just as the older dictionaries it includes uniquely Canadian words and words borrowed from other languages, and surveyed spellings, such as whether ''colour'' or ''color'' was the more popular choice in common use. Paperback and concise versions (2005, 2006), with minor updates, are available.\n\n== Phonology and phonetics ==\nIn terms of the major sound systems ([[Phonology|phonologies]]) of English around the world, Canadian English aligns most closely to American English, both being grouped together under a common [[North American English]] sound system; the mainstream Canadian accent (\"Standard Canadian\") is often compared to the very similar and largely overlapping \"General American\" accent, an accent widely spoken throughout the United States and perceived there as being relatively lacking in any noticeable regional features.\n\nThe provinces east of Ontario show the largest dialect diversity. Northern Canada is, according to [[William Labov]], a dialect region in formation, and a homogeneous dialect has not yet formed.<ref>Labov, p. 214</ref> A very homogeneous dialect exists in Western and Central Canada, a situation that is similar to that of the Western United States. Labov identifies an inland region that concentrates all of the defining features of the dialect centred on the Prairies, with periphery areas with more variable patterns including the metropolitan areas of Vancouver and Toronto.<ref name=\"Labov\" /> This dialect forms a dialect continuum with the far [[Western American English|Western U.S. English]], however it is sharply differentiated from the [[Inland North]]ern U.S. English of the central and eastern Great Lakes region.\n\nCanadian English raises the diphthong onsets, /\u0259, \u028c/ before voiceless segments; diphthongs /ai/ and /au/.<ref name=\"Hickey\">{{Cite journal\n| last  = Hickey\n| first = Raymond\n| date  = 9 December 2013\n| title = A Dictionary of Varieties of English\n| url   = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118602607\n| doi   = 10.1002/9781118602607\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Standard Canadian English ===\n{{Main|Standard Canadian English}}\n[[Standard Canadian English]] is socially defined.

In addition to that, [[flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} before reduced vowels is ubiquitous, so the words ''ladder'' and ''latter'', for example, are mostly or entirely [[homophonous|pronounced the same]].\n* Perhaps the most recognizable feature of Canadian English is \"[[Canadian raising]]\".<ref name=\"Labov\" /> For the beginning points of the diphthongs ([[diphthongs|gliding vowels]]) {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} (as in the words ''height'' and ''mice'') and {{IPA|/a\u028a/}} (as in ''shout'' and ''house''), the tongue is often more \"[[raising (phonology)|raised]]\" in the mouth when these diphthongs come before [[voiceless consonant]]s, in comparison with other varieties of English. Before voiceless consonants, {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} becomes {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a~\u025c\u026a~\u0250\u026a]}}; thus, a [[minimal pair|split]] between ''rider'' as {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e4\u026a\u027e\u025a]}} and ''writer'' possibly as {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u028c\u026a\u027e\u025a]}} ({{Audio|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|<small>listen</small>|help=no}}). In General American, ''out'' is typically {{IPA-all|\u00e4\u028at || en-us-out.ogg}}, but, with slight Canadian raising, it may sound more like {{IPA-all|\u0250\u028at || en-ca-out.ogg}}, or, with the strong Canadian raising of the Prairies and Nova Scotia, more like {{IPA-all|\u028c\u028at}}.\n* Almost all Canadians have the [[cot\u2013caught merger]], which also occurs primarily in the Western U.S., but often elsewhere in the U.S., especially recently. Speakers do not distinguish the vowels {{IPAslink|\u0254}} (as in ''caught'') and {{IPAslink|\u0251}} (as in ''cot''), which merge.<ref name=\"Labov\" />\n* The above merger creates a hole in the short vowel sub-system<ref>Martinet, Andre 1955. Economie des changements phonetiques. Berne: Francke.</ref> and triggers a sound change known as the [[Canadian Shift]], which involves the front lax vowels {{IPA|/\u00e6, \u025b, \u026a/}} each lowering or retracting away from their original placements.<ref>Labov p. 219.</ref>\n\n=== Regional variation ===\nThe literature has for a long time conflated the notions of Standard Canadian English (StCE) and regional variation. While some regional dialects are close with the StCE, they are not identical with it. To the untrained ear, for instance, a BC middle class speaker from a rural setting may sound like a StCE speaker, while, given Chambers' definition, such person, because of the rural provenance, would not be included in the accepted definition (see the previous section). The ''Atlas of North American English,'' while being the best source for US regional variation, is not a good source for Canadian regional variation, as its analysis is based on only 33<ref>{{Cite book\n| title     = The Atlas of North American English\n| last      = Labov, Ash and Boberg\n| first     = \n| publisher = de Gruyter\n| year      = 2005\n| isbn      = \n| location  = Berlin\n| pages     = Chapter 20\n}}</ref> Canadian speakers. Boberg's (2005, 2008) studies offer the best data for the delimitation of dialect zones.

In [[Vancouver]], speakers exhibit more vowel retraction of {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} before nasals than people from [[Toronto]], and this retraction may become a regional marker of West Coast English.<ref>Erin Hall \"Regional variation in Canadian English vowel backing\"</ref> /aeg/ raising (found words such as bag, vague and bagel), a prominent feature in western American speakers, is also found in Vancouver speakers.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last    = Swan\n| first   = Julia\n| year    = 2016\n| title   = Canadian English in the Pacific Northwest: A phonetic comparison of Vancouver, BC and Seattle, WA\n| journal = Proceedings of the 2016 Annual Conference of the Canadian Linguistic Association\n}}</ref> [[Canadian raising]] (found in words such as \"about\" and \"writer\") is less prominent in BC than other parts of the country and is on the decline further, with many speakers not raising {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiceless consonants.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Younger speakers in the [[Greater Vancouver]] area do not even raise {{IPA|/a\u028a/}}, causing \"about\" to sound somewhat like \"a boat\".  The \"o\" in such words as ''holy, goal, load, know,'' etc. is pronounced as a back and rounded {{IPA|[o]}}, but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there is a strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influence.\n\n==== Ontario ====\n[[Canadian raising]] is quite strong throughout the province of [[Ontario]], except within the [[Ottawa Valley]]. The [[Canadian Shift]] is also a common [[vowel shift]] found in Ontario. The retraction of {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} was found to be more advanced for women in Ontario than for people from the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] or [[Atlantic Canada]] and men.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1   = Chambers\n| first1  = J.

Additionally, there is a tendency to round the mouth after pronouncing the vowel \"o\" which is distinct from the General American Accent. Also, the vowel of \"bag\" sounds closer to \"vague\" or \"egg\"; \"right\" sounds like \"rate\"; and the \"ah\" vowel in \"can't\" is drawn out, sounding like \"kee-ant\".\n\nThe subregion of [[Midwestern Ontario]] consists of the Counties of [[Huron County, Ontario|Huron]], [[Bruce County, Ontario|Bruce]], [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey]], and [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth]]. The \"Queen's Bush\" as the area was called, did not experience communication with Southwestern and Central dialects until the early 20th century. Thus, a strong accent similar to Central Ontarian is heard, yet many different phrasings exist. It is typical in the area to drop phonetic sounds to make shorter contractions, such as: Prolly (Probably), Goin' (Going), and \"Wuts goin' on tonight?  D'ya wanna do sumthin'?\"  It is particularly strong in the County of Bruce, so much that it is commonly referred to as being the Bruce Cownian (Bruce Countian) accent. Also 'er' sounds are often pronounced 'air', with \"were\" sounding more like \"wear\".\n\nResidents of the [[Golden Horseshoe]] (including the [[Greater Toronto Area]]) are known to [[intervocalic alveolar flapping|merge the second {{IPA|/t/}} with the {{IPA|/n/}}]] in ''Toronto'', pronouncing the name variously as {{IPA|[t\u02b0o\u02c8\u0279\u0252\u027e\u0303o]}}, {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0259\u02c8\u0279\u0252\u027e\u0303o]}} or even {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u02b0\u0279\u0252\u027e\u0303o]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u02b0\u0279\u0252\u027e\u0303\u0259]}}. This, however, is not unique to Toronto as Atlanta is often pronounced \"Atlanna\" by residents. In Toronto and the other areas within the [[Greater Toronto Area]], the ''th'' sound {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[d]}}. Sometimes {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} is elided altogether, resulting in \"Do you want this one er'iss one?\" The word ''southern'' is often pronounced with {{IPA|[a\u028a]}}. In the area north of the [[Regional Municipality of York]] and south of [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]], notably among those who were born in the surrounding communities, the cutting down of syllables and consonants often heard, e.g. \"probably\" is reduced to \"prolly\", or \"probly\" when used as a response. In Greater Toronto, the [[diphthong]] tends to be fronted (as a result the word ''about'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8b\u025b\u028at]}} or 'a-beh-oot').\n\nThe Greater Toronto Area is diverse linguistically with 44 percent of its people holding a mother tongue other than English.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/economy/demographics/census/cenhi06-8.pdf\n| title       = 2006 Census Highlights \u2013 Mother tongue and Language\n| access-date = 7 February 2017\n| publisher   = [[Ontario]] Ministry of Finance\n}}</ref> As a result Toronto has a distinct variation from other regions.<ref>Labov pp. 214\u2013215.</ref> In Toronto's ethnic communities there are many words that are distinct; many of which come from the city's large [[Caribbean]] community.

In [[Prescott and Russell United Counties, Ontario|Prescott and Russell]], parts of [[Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry United Counties|Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry]] and Eastern [[Ottawa]], French accents are often mixed with English ones due to the high Franco-Ontarian population there. In [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]], Western [[Ottawa]] and [[Leeds and Grenville United Counties, Ontario|Leeds-Grenville]] and the rest of [[Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry United Counties|Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry]], the accent spoken is nearly identical to that spoken in [[Central Ontario]] and the [[Quinte]] area. Phrases such as \"got it\" is often pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0261\u0254\u027e\u026a\u0294]}}. Okay is often pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0254\u026ake]}}, while \"hello\" is often pronounced as {{IPA|[helo]}}.\n\nA linguistic exclave has also formed in the [[Ottawa Valley]], heavily influenced by original [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Germany|German]] settlers, and existing along the Ontario-Quebec boundary, has its own distinct accent known as the [[Ottawa Valley twang]] or brogue).<ref>Henry, Alison. 1992. Infinitives in a For-To Dialect. Natural Language & Linguistic Theory 2, 279.</ref> Phonetically, the Ottawa Valley twang is characterized by the lack of [[Canadian raising]] as well as the [[cot\u2013caught merger]], two common elements of mainstream Canadian English. However, this accent is quite rare in the region today.<ref>Cheshire, Jenny. (ed.) 1991. ''English Around the World: Sociolinguistic Perspectives''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 134.</ref>\n\n==== Quebec ====\n{{Main|Quebec English}}\nEnglish is a minority language in Quebec (with French in the majority), but has many speakers in Montreal, the [[Eastern Townships]] and in the [[Gatineau]]-[[Ottawa]] region. Uniquely, many people in [[Montreal]] distinguish between words like ''marry'' versus ''merry'' and ''parish'' versus ''perish'',<ref name=\"Labov\" /> which are homophones to most other speakers of Canadian English. Quebec also has French influence. A person with English mother tongue and still speaking English as the first language is called an ''Anglophone'' versus a French speaker, or ''Francophone''. Quebec Anglophones generally pronounce French street names in Montreal as French words. ''Pie IX'' Boulevard is pronounced as in French, not as \"pie nine\", but as \"pee-neuff\". On the other hand, Anglophones do pronounce final d's as in ''Bernard'' and ''Bouchard''; the word ''Montreal'' is pronounced as an English word and ''Rue Lambert-Closse'' is known as ''Clossy Street''.\n\nIn the city of Montreal, especially in some of the western suburbs like C\u00f4te-St-Luc and Hampstead, there is a strong [[Jew]]ish influence in the English spoken in these areas. A large wave of Jewish immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]] before and after [[World War II]] is also evident today. Their English has a strong [[Yiddish]] influence; there are some similarities to English spoken in [[New York City|New York]]. Words used mainly in Quebec and especially in Montreal are:<ref>Boberg, p. 36.</ref> ''stage'' for \"apprenticeship\" or \"internship\", ''copybook'' for a notebook, ''d\u00e9panneur'' or ''dep'' for a convenience store, and ''guichet'' for an ABM/ATM. It is also common for Anglophones, particularly of Greek or Italian descent, to use translated French words instead of common English equivalents such as \"open\" and \"close\" for \"on\" and \"off\" or \"Open the lights, please\" for \"Turn on the lights, please\".\n\n==== Maritimes ====\n{{Main|Canadian Maritime English}}\n[[File:Atlantic Canada IPA chart.PNG|350px|right|thumb|Based on Labov et al.; averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from NS, NB, NL.]]\nMany in the Maritime provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]&nbsp;\u2013 have an accent that sounds more like [[Scottish English]] and, in some places, [[Irish English]] than General American. Outside of major communities, dialects can vary markedly from community to community, as well as from province to province, reflecting ethnic origin as well as a past in which there were few roads and many communities, with some villages very isolated. Into the 1980s, residents of villages in northern Nova Scotia could identify themselves by dialects and accents distinctive to their village. The dialects of Prince Edward Island are often considered the most distinct grouping.\n\nThe phonology of [[Maritimer English]] has some unique features:\n* Cot-caught merger in effect, but toward a central vowel {{IPA|\u00e4}}.\n* No [[Canadian Shift]] of the short [[front vowel]]s\n* Pre-consonantal {{IPA|/r/}} is sometimes (though rarely) deleted.\n* The flapping of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to alveolar tap {{IPA|[\u027e]}} between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, is less common in the Maritimes. Therefore, ''battery'' is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u00e6t\u0279i]}} instead of {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u00e6\u027e(\u0259)\u0279i]}}.\n* Especially among the older generation, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}} are not merged; that is, the beginning sound of why, white, and which is different from that of witch, with, wear.\n* Like most varieties of CanE, Maritimer English contains Canadian raising.\n\n==== Newfoundland ====\n{{Main|Newfoundland English}}\n\nThe [[dialect]] spoken in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], an autonomous dominion until 31 March 1949, is often considered the most distinctive Canadian English dialect. Some Newfoundland English differs in [[vowel]] [[pronunciation]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and preservation of [[Archaism|archaic]] adverbial-intensifiers. The dialect can vary markedly from community to community, as well as from region to region, reflecting ethnic origin as well as a past in which there were few roads and many communities, and [[Newfoundland outport|fishing villages]] in particular remained very isolated. A few speakers have a transitional pin\u2013pen merger.<ref name=\"Labov\" />\n\n==== Aboriginal north ====\n{{further|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Inuit languages}}\n[[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] people from [[Northern Canada]] speak a version of Canadian English influenced by the phonology of their first languages. European Canadians in these regions are relatively recent arrivals, and have not produced a dialect that is distinct from southern Canadian English.<ref>Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; and Boberg, Charles. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qa4-dFqi6iMC&pg=PA216 ''The Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology, and Sound Change'']. Walter de Gruyter, 2006, p. 216: \"In general, the English spoken in the Canadian North can be viewed as a dialect in formation ...

British and American terms also can coexist in Canadian English to various extents, sometimes with new nuances in meaning; a classic example is ''holiday'' (British) often used interchangeably with ''vacation'' (American), though, in Canadian speech, the latter can more narrowly mean a trip elsewhere and the former can mean general time off work. Canadian English morpho-syntactic features also affect their vocabulary; this includes their tendency to use the possessive \"have\" as opposed to \"have got\" or \"got,\" which differs from both British English and American English.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last         = Tagliamonte\n| first        = Sali\n| year         = 2006\n| title        = ''So cool, right?'': Canadian English Entering the 21st Century\n| url          = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/228670\n| journal      = The Canadian Journal of Linguistics / La revue canadienne de linguistique\n| volume       = 51\n| issue        = 2\n| pages        = 309\u2013331\n| doi          = 10.1353/cjl.2008.0018\n| issn         = 1710-1115\n| access-date  = 24 February 2018\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180224173256/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/228670\n| archive-date = 24 February 2018\n| dead-url     = no\n| df           =\n}}</ref> In addition, the vocabulary of Canadian English also features some words that are seldom (if ever) found elsewhere. A good resource for these and other words is the [[Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles]], which is currently being revised at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia. The Canadian public appears to take interest in unique \"Canadianisms\": words that are distinctively characteristic of Canadian English\u2014though perhaps not exclusive to Canada; there is some disagreement about the extent to which \"Canadianism\" means a term actually unique to Canada, with such an understanding possibly overstated by the popular media.<ref name=\"Dollinger 2008\" /><ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/4002053/Uniquely_Canadian_Eh_Review_of_Barber_Katherine._2007._Only_in_Canada_You_Say_A_Treasury_of_Canadian_Language._Oxford_University_Press Uniquely Canadian, Eh?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021064829/http://www.academia.edu/4002053/Uniquely_Canadian_Eh_Review_of_Barber_Katherine._2007._Only_in_Canada_You_Say_A_Treasury_of_Canadian_Language._Oxford_University_Press |date=2017-10-21 }}\" Review of Barber, Katherine by Stefan Dollinger. 2007. ''Only in Canada You Say: A Treasury of Canadian Language''. Oxford University Press.</ref>\nAs a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Canada shares many items of institutional terminology and professional designations with the countries of the former [[British Empire]]&nbsp;\u2013 for example, ''constable'', for a police officer of the lowest rank, and ''chartered accountant''.\n\n=== Education ===\nThe term ''college'', which refers to post-secondary education in general in the U.S., refers in Canada to either a post-secondary technical or vocational institution, or to one of the colleges that exist as [[federated school]]s within some Canadian universities. Most often, a ''college'' is a community college, not a university. It may also refer to a [[CEGEP]] in Quebec. In Canada, ''college student'' might denote someone obtaining a diploma in business management while ''university student'' is the term for someone earning a [[bachelor's degree]]. For that reason, ''going to college'' does not have the same meaning as ''going to university'', unless the speaker or context clarifies the specific level of post-secondary education that is meant.\n\nWithin the public school system the chief administrator of a school is generally \"the principal\", as in the United States, but the term is not used preceding his or her name, i.e. \"Principal Smith\". The assistant to the principal is not titled as \"assistant principal\", but rather as \"vice-principal\", although the former is not unknown. This usage is identical to that in [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nCanadian universities publish ''calendars'' or ''schedules'', not ''catalogs'' as in the U.S.. Canadian students ''write'' or ''take'' exams (in the U.S., students generally \"take\" exams while teachers \"write\" them); they rarely ''sit'' them (standard British usage). Those who supervise students during an exam are sometimes called ''invigilators'' as in [[England|Britain]], or sometimes ''proctors'' as in the U.S; usage may depend on the region or even the individual institution.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url   = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/proctor\n| title = proctor {{! }} Definition of proctor in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305142751/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/proctor|archive-date=5 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nSuccessive years of school are usually referred to as ''grade one'', ''grade two'', and so on. In Quebec, the speaker (if Francophone) will often say ''primary one'', ''primary two'' (a direct translation from the [[French language|French]]), and so on; while Anglophones will say ''grade one'', ''grade two''. (Compare American ''first grade, second grade'' (sporadically found in Canada), and English/Welsh ''Year 1, Year 2'', Scottish/Nth.Irish ''Primary 1, Primary 2'' or ''P1, P2'', and Sth.Irish ''First Class, Second Class'' and so on.).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''American Speech'' 80.1 (2005), p. 47.</ref> The year of school before grade 1 is usually called \"Kindergarten\", with the exception of [[Nova Scotia]], where it is called \"grade primary\".\n\nIn the U.S., the four years of high school are termed the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years (terms also used for college years); in Canada, the specific levels are used instead (i.e., \"grade nine\").<ref name=\"Speech\">''American Speech'' 80.1 (2005), p. 48.</ref> As for higher education, only the term ''freshman'' (often reduced to ''frosh'') has some currency in Canada.<ref name=\"Speech\" /> The American usages \"sophomore\", \"junior\" and \"senior\" are not used in Canadian university terminology, or in speech. The specific high-school grades and university years are therefore stated and individualized; for example, ''the grade 12s failed to graduate''; ''John is in his second year at McMaster''. The \"first year\", \"third year\" designation also applies to Canadian law school students, as opposed to the common American usage of \"1L\", \"2L\" and \"3L\".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nCanadian students use the term ''marks'' (more common in England) or ''grades'' (more common in the US) to refer to their results; usage is very mixed.<ref name=\"Speech\" />\n\n=== Units of measurement ===\nUnlike in the United States, use of [[SI|metric]] units within a majority of industries (but not all) is standard in Canada, as a result of the [[metrication in Canada|national adoption of the metric system]] during the mid-to-late 1970s; this has spawned some colloquial usages such as ''klick'' for kilometre (as also heard in the U.S. military). Nonetheless, Imperial units are still used in many situations. For example, [[English Canadians]] state their weight and height in pounds and feet/inches, respectively. This is also the case for many Quebec Francophones. Distances while playing golf are always marked and discussed in yards, though official scorecards may also show metres. Temperatures for cooking are often given in [[Fahrenheit]], while the weather is given in [[Celsius]]. Directions in the [[Prairie provinces]] are sometimes given using miles, because the country roads generally follow the mile-based grid of the [[Dominion Land Survey]]. Canadians measure property, both residential and commercial, in square feet exclusively. Fuel efficiency is less frequently discussed in miles per [[Imperial gallon|gallon]], more often the metric L/100&nbsp;km. The [[Letter (paper size)|Letter]] [[paper size]] of 8.5&nbsp;inches \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches is used instead of the international and metric [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] size of 210&nbsp;mm \u00d7 297&nbsp;mm.\n\n=== Transportation ===\n* Although Canadian lexicon features both ''railway'' and ''railroad'', ''railway'' is the usual term in naming (witness [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), though ''railroad'' can be heard fairly frequently in some regions; most [[rail terminology]] in Canada, however, follows American usage (for example, ''ties'' and ''cars'' rather than ''sleepers'' and ''carriages'').\n* A two-way ticket can be either a ''round-trip'' (American term) or a ''return'' (British term).\n* The terms ''highway'' (for example, [[Trans-Canada Highway]]), ''expressway'' (Central Canada, as in the [[Gardiner Expressway]]) and ''freeway'' ([[Sherwood Park Freeway]], [[Edmonton]]) are often used to describe various high speed roads with varying levels of access control. Generally, but not exclusively, ''highway'' refers to any provincially funded road regardless of its access control. Often such roads will be numbered. Similar to the US, the terms ''expressway'' and ''freeway'' are often used interchangeably to refer to [[controlled-access highways]], that is, divided highways with access only at grade-separated interchanges (for example, a [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-Series Highway]] in Ontario).\n\nHowever, ''expressway'' may also refer to a [[limited-access road]] that has control of access but has [[at-grade]] junctions, railway crossings (for example, the [[Harbour Expressway]] in [[Thunder Bay]].) Sometimes the term ''[[Parkway (disambiguation)|Parkway]]'' is also used (for example, the [[Hanlon Parkway]] in [[Guelph]]). In [[Saskatchewan]], the term 'grid road' is used to refer to minor highways or rural roads, usually gravel, referring to the 'grid' upon which they were originally designed. In [[Quebec]], freeways and expressways are called [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroutes]].\n\nIn [[Alberta]], the generic ''Trail'' is often used to describe a freeway, expressway or major urban street (for example, [[Deerfoot Trail]], [[Macleod Trail]] or [[Crowchild Trail]] in [[Calgary]], [[Yellowhead Trail]] in [[Edmonton]]). The British term ''[[motorway]]'' is not used. The American terms ''[[Toll road|turnpike]]'' and ''[[tollway]]'' for a toll road are not common. The term ''throughway'' or ''[[freeway|thruway]]'' was used for first tolled limited-access highways (for example, the Deas Island Throughway, now Highway 99, from [[Vancouver]], BC, to [[Blaine, Washington]], USA or the Saint John Throughway (Highway 1) in [[Saint John, NB]]), but this term is not common anymore. In everyday speech, when a particular roadway is not being specified, the term ''highway'' is generally or exclusively used.\n* A railway at-grade junction can be called a ''[[level crossing]],'' as well as the term ''[[grade crossing]]'', which is commonly used in the US.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url          = https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/railsafety-333.htm\n| title        = Grade Crossing Safety\n| last         = Safety\n| first        = Government of Canada, Transport Canada, Safety and Security, Rail\n| website      = tc.gc.ca\n| access-date  = 24 January 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129004919/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/railsafety-333.htm\n| archive-date = 29 January 2017\n| dead-url     = no\n| df           =\n}}</ref>\n* A railway or highway crossing overhead is an ''overpass'' or ''underpass'', depending on which part of the crossing is referred to (the two are used more or less interchangeably); the British term ''flyover'' is sometimes used in [[Ontario]], and in the Maritimes as well as on occasion in the prairies (such as the 4th avenue flyover in Calgary, Alberta), ''subway'' is also used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n* In Quebec, English speakers often use the word \"metro\" to mean [[Rapid transit|subway]]. Non-native Anglophones of Quebec will also use the designated proper title \"metro\" to describe the Montreal subway system.\n* The term ''Texas gate'' refers to the type of [[cattle grid|metal grid]] called a ''cattle guard'' in American English or a ''cattle grid'' in British English.\n* Depending on the region, large trucks used to transport and deliver goods are referred to as 'transport trucks' (E.g. used in Ontario and Alberta) or 'transfer trucks' (E.g. used in Prince Edward Island)\n\n=== Politics ===\n* While in standard usage the terms [[prime minister]] and [[premier]] are interchangeable terms for the head of an elected parliamentary government, Canadian English today generally follows a usage convention of reserving the title ''prime minister'' for the federal first minister and referring to provincial or territorial leaders as ''premiers''. However, because [[Canadian French]] does not have separate terms for the two positions, using ''premier ministre'' for both, the title ''prime minister'' is sometimes seen in reference to a provincial leader when a francophone is speaking or writing English. Also, until the 1970s the leader of the Ontario provincial government was officially styled ''prime minister''.\n* When a majority of the elected members of the House of Commons or a provincial legislature are not members of the same party as the government, the situation is referred to as a minority government rather than a hung Parliament.\n* To ''table'' a document in Canada is to present it (as in Britain), whereas in the U.S. it means to withdraw it from consideration. (However in non-governmental meetings using Robert's Rules of Order to table a document can be to postpone consideration until a later date.)\n* Several political terms are more in use in Canada than elsewhere, including ''riding'' (as a general term for a [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary]] constituency or [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]]). The term ''[[reeve (Canada)|reeve]]'' was at one time common for the equivalent of a mayor in some smaller municipalities in [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]], but is now falling into disuse. The title is still used for the leader of a rural municipality in [[Saskatchewan]], parts of [[Alberta]], and [[Manitoba]].\n* The term ''Tory,'' used in Britain with a [[tory|similar meaning]], denotes a supporter of the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the historic [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|federal]] or provincial Progressive Conservative Party. The term [[Red Tory]] is also used to denote the more socially liberal wings of the Tory parties. [[Blue Tory]] is less commonly used, and refers to more strict fiscal (rather than social) conservatism. The U.S. use of ''Tory'' to mean the Loyalists in the time of the American Revolution is not used in Canada,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} where they are called [[United Empire Loyalists]], or simply Loyalists.\n* Members of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or a provincial Liberal party are sometimes referred to as ''Grits''. Historically, the term comes from the phrase ''Clear Grit'', used in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] in Canada to denote an object of quality or a truthful person. The term was assumed as a nickname by Liberals by the 1850s.\n* Members of the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] are sometimes referred to as ''Bloquistes''. At the purely provincial level, members of Quebec's [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] are often referred to as ''P\u00e9quistes'', and members of the Quebec provincial [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]] as ''Ad\u00e9quistes''.\n* The term \"Socred\" is no longer common due to its namesake party's decline, but referred to members of the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit Party]], and was particularly common in British Columbia<!--and Alberta?-->. It was not used for Social Credit members from Quebec, nor generally used for the federal caucus of that party; in both cases ''Cr\u00e9ditiste'', the French term, was used in English.\n* Members of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] are referred to by the title \"Senator\" preceding their name, as in the United States. Members of the [[House of Commons of Canada]], following British parliamentary nomenclature, are termed \"Members of Parliament\", and are referred to as \"Jennifer Jones, MP\" during their term of office only. Senators, and members of the Privy Council are styled \"The Honourable\" for life, and the Prime Minister of Canada is styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life, as is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor General. This honorific may also be bestowed by Parliament, as it was to retiring deputy prime minister [[Herb Gray]] in 1996. Members of provincial legislatures do not have a pre-nominal style, except in certain provinces, such as Nova Scotia where members of the Queen's [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia]] are styled \"The Honourable\" for life, and are entitled to the use of the post-nominal letters \"ECNS\".<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/1st_read/b198.htm\n| title      = Gov.ns.ca\n| publisher  = Gov.ns.ca\n| accessdate = 26 February 2011\n}}</ref> The Cabinet of Ontario serves concurrently (and not for life) as the [[Executive Council of Ontario]], while serving members are styled \"The Honourable\", but are not entitled to post-nominal letters.\n* Members of provincial/territorial legislative assemblies are called [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLAs]] in all provinces and territories except: [[Ontario]], where they have been called [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Members of Provincial Parliament]] (MPPs) since 1938; [[Quebec]], where they have been called [[Member of the National Assembly (Quebec)|Members of the National Assembly]] (MNAs) since 1968; and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], where they are called [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|Members of the House of Assembly]] (MHAs).\n\n=== Law ===\n[[Lawyer]]s in all parts of Canada, except [[Quebec]], which has its own [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, are called \"[[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s\" because any lawyer licensed in any of the common law provinces and territories must pass bar exams for, and is permitted to engage in, both types of legal practice in contrast to other common-law jurisdictions such as [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]] where the two are traditionally separated (i.e., Canada has a [[fused profession|fused legal profession]]). The words ''lawyer'' and ''counsel'' (not ''counsellor'') predominate in everyday contexts; the word ''attorney'' refers to any personal representative. Canadian lawyers generally do not refer to themselves as \"attorneys\", a term that is common in the United States.\n\nThe equivalent of an American ''[[district attorney]]'', meaning the barrister representing the state in criminal proceedings, is called a ''[[crown attorney]]'' (in [[Ontario]]), ''crown counsel'' (in British Columbia), ''crown prosecutor'' or ''the crown'', on account of Canada's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which [[the Crown]] is the locus of state power.\n\nThe words ''advocate'' and ''[[civil law notary|notary]]''&nbsp;\u2013 two distinct professions in Quebec civil law&nbsp;\u2013 are used to refer to that province's equivalent of barrister and solicitor, respectively. In Canada's [[common law]] provinces and territories, the word ''notary'' means strictly a [[notary public]].\n\nWithin the Canadian legal community itself, the word ''[[solicitor]]'' is often used to refer to any Canadian lawyer in general (much like the way the word ''attorney'' is used in the United States to refer to any American lawyer in general). Despite the conceptual distinction between ''barrister'' and ''solicitor'', Canadian court documents would contain a phrase such as \"''John Smith, ''solicitor'' for the Plaintiff''\" even though \"John Smith\" may well himself be the barrister who argues the case in court. In a letter introducing him/herself to an opposing lawyer, a Canadian lawyer normally writes something like \"''I am the ''solicitor'' for Mr. Tom Jones.\"\n\nThe word ''litigator'' is also used by lawyers to refer to a fellow lawyer who specializes in lawsuits even though the more traditional word ''barrister'' is still employed to denote the same specialization.\n\nJudges of Canada's superior courts, which exist at the provincial and territorial levels, are traditionally addressed as ''\"My Lord\"'' or ''\"My Lady\"'', however there are some variances across certain jurisdictions, with some superior court judges preferring the titles ''\"Mister Justice\"'' or ''\"Madam Justice\"'' to ''\"Lordship\"''.\n\n[[Master (judiciary)|Masters]] are addressed as ''\"Mr. Master\"'' or simply ''\"Sir.\"'' In British Columbia, masters are addressed as ''\"Your Honour.\"''\n\nJudges of provincial or inferior courts are traditionally referred to in person as ''\"Your Honour\"''. Judges of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and of the federal-level courts prefer the use of ''\"Mister/Madam (Chief) Justice\"''. [[Justice of The Peace#Canada|Justices of The Peace]] are addressed as ''\"Your Worship\"''. ''\"Your Honour\"'' is also the correct form of address for a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]].\n\nA serious crime is called an [[indictable offence]], while a less-serious crime is called a [[summary offence]]. The older words [[felony]] and [[misdemeanour]], which are still used in the United States, are not used in Canada's current ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46) or by today's Canadian legal system. As noted throughout the ''Criminal Code'', a person accused of a crime is called ''the accused'' and not ''the defendant'', a term used instead in civil lawsuits.\n\nIn Canada, ''[[visible minority]]'' refers to a non-aboriginal person or group visibly not one of the majority race in a given population. The term comes from the [[Employment equity (Canada)|Canadian Employment Equity Act]], which defines such people as \"persons, other than [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal people]], who are non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] in race or non-[[white people|white]] in [[skin colour|colour]].\"<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/reference/reportsandguides/visible-minorities.cfm Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide, 2006 Census] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211044318/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/reference/reportsandguides/visible-minorities.cfm |date=11 December 2008 }} from StatsCan</ref> The term is used as a demographic category by [[Statistics Canada]].

In Newfoundland, this is almost exclusively referred to as a \"[[hip flask|flask]]\". In the United States, \"mickey\", or \"[[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey Finn]]\", refers to a drink laced with drugs.\n** ''two-six'', ''twenty-sixer'', ''twixer'': a {{convert|750|mL|USfloz impfloz|abbr=on}} bottle of hard liquor (called a quart in the Maritimes). The word ''handle'' is less common. Similarly, a {{convert|1.14|L|USfloz impfloz|abbr=on}} bottle of hard liquor is known as a ''forty'' and a {{convert|1.75|L|USfloz impfloz|abbr=on}} bottle is known as a ''sixty'' or ''half gallon'' in Nova Scotia.\n** ''Texas mickey'' (especially in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; more often a \"Saskatchewan mickey\" in western Canada): a {{convert|3|L|USfloz impfloz|0|abbr=on}} bottle of hard liquor. (Despite the name, Texas mickeys are generally unavailable outside of Canada.)\n** ''two-four'': a case of 24 beers, also known as a ''case'' in Eastern Canada, or a ''flat'' in Western Canada (referencing that cans of beer are often sold in packages of six, with four packages to a flat box for shipping and stacking purposes).\n** ''six-pack'', ''half-sack'', ''half-case'', or ''poverty-pack'': a case of six beers\n* ''[[poutine]]'': a snack of french fries topped with cheese curds and hot gravy.\n* There are also [[genericized trademark]]s used in Canada:\n** ''[[cheezies]]'': [[cheese puffs]]. The name is a [[genericized trademark]] based on a brand of crunchy cheese snack sold in Canada.\n** [[Kraft Dinner]] or \"KD\": for any packaged dry macaroni and cheese mix, even when it is not produced by Kraft.\n* ''[[freezie]]'': A frozen flavoured sugar water snack common worldwide, but known by this name exclusively in Canada.\n* ''dainty'': a fancy cookie, pastry, or square served at a social event (usually plural). Used in western Canada.\n* ''[[Smarties]]'': a bean-sized, small candy covered chocolate, similar to plain [[M&M's]]. This is also seen in British English. [[Smarties (tablet candy)|Smarties in the United States]] refer to small tart powdered disc sold in rolls; in Canada these tart candies are sold as \"[[Rockets (wafer candy)|Rockets]]\".\n\n=== Prairies (Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta) ===\nA strong Canadian raising exists in the prairie regions together with certain older usages such as ''chesterfield'' and ''front room'' also associated with the Maritimes. Aboriginal Canadians are a larger and more conspicuous population in prairie cities than elsewhere in the country and certain elements of aboriginal speech in English are sometimes to be heard. Similarly, the linguistic legacy, mostly intonation but also speech patterns and syntax, of the [[Scandinavia]]n, [[Slav]]ic and [[Germany|German]] settlers&nbsp;\u2013 who are far more numerous and historically important in the Prairies than in Ontario or the Maritimes&nbsp;\u2013 can be heard in the general milieu. Again, the large [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] population in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] also carries with it certain linguistic traits inherited from [[French people|French]], Aboriginal and [[Celt]]ic forebears.\nSome terms are derived from immigrant groups or are just local inventions:\n* bluff: small group of trees isolated by [[prairie]]\n* bunny hug: elsewhere ''[[hoodie]]'' or ''hooded sweat shirt'' (mainly in Saskatchewan, but also in Manitoba)\n* ginch/gonch/gitch/gotch: underwear (usually men's or boys' underwear, more specifically briefs; whereas women's underwear are ''gotchies''), probably of Eastern European or Ukrainian origin. ''Gitch'' and ''gotch'' are primarily used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba while the variants with an ''n'' are common in Alberta and British Columbia.<ref>[http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/gonch/ Doubletongued.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122104734/http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/gonch |date=22 November 2008 }}, reference for gonch.</ref>\n* jam buster: jelly-filled doughnut.\n* porch climber: [[moonshine]] or homemade alcohol.

Formerly a brand of chocolate milk.\n\nIn farming communities with substantial [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], German or [[Mennonite]] populations, accents, sentence structure and vocabulary influenced by these languages is common. These communities are most common in the [[Saskatchewan Valley]] region of Saskatchewan and [[Red River Valley]] region of Manitoba.\n\nDescendants of marriages between Hudson's Bay Company workers of mainly Scottish descent and Cree women spoke [[Bungi]], a [[creole language|creole]] that blends Cree and English. A few Bungi speakers can still be found in Manitoba. It is marked by no masculine, feminine or third-person pronouns.<ref name=\"Hickey\" />\n\n=== British Columbia ===\nBritish Columbian English has several words still in current use borrowed from the [[Chinook Jargon]] although the use of such vocabulary is observably decreasing. The most famous and widely used of these terms are ''[[skookum]]'' and ''[[Chinook Jargon use by English-language speakers|saltchuck]]''. However, among young [[British Columbia]]ns, almost no one uses this vocabulary, and only a small percentage is even familiar with the meaning of such words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the [[Yukon]], ''cheechako'' is used for newcomers or greenhorns.\n\n=== Northern Ontario ===\n[[Northern Ontario]] English has several distinct qualities stemming from its large [[Franco-Ontarian]] population. As a result several [[French language|French]] and English words are used interchangeably. A number of phrases and expressions may also be found in Northern Ontario that are not present in the rest of the province,<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/09/27/looking_for_true_canadian_english_there_go_north.html\n| title      = Looking for true Canadian English, there?

However, the \"buttocks\" sense does not have the indecent character it retains in British use, as it and \"butt\" are commonly used as a polite or childish euphemism for ruder words such as ''[[buttocks|arse]]'' (commonly used in Atlantic Canada and among older people in Ontario and to the west) or ''[[buttocks|ass]]'', or ''mitiss'' (used in the Prairie Provinces, especially in northern and central Saskatchewan; probably originally a Cree loanword). Older Canadians may see \"bum\" as more polite than \"butt\", which before the 1980s was often considered rude.\n\nSimilarly the word ''pissed'' can refer either to being drunk (as in Britain), or being angry (as in the U.S.), though anger is more often said as ''pissed off'', while ''piss drunk'' or ''pissed up'' is said to describe inebriation (though ''piss drunk'' is sometimes also used in the US, especially in the northern states).\n\nOne of the most distinctive Canadian phrases is the spoken interrogation or tag ''[[eh]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n| last1      = Nosowitz\n| first1     = Dan\n| title      = Why Do Canadians Say 'Eh'?:  The story behind Canada's most distinctive verbal tic\n| url        = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-do-canadians-say-eh\n| website    = Atlas Obscura\n| publisher  = Atlas Obscura\n| accessdate = 12 January 2017\n| date       = 10 January 2017\n}}</ref> The only usage of ''eh'' exclusive to Canada, according to the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', is for \"ascertaining the comprehension, continued interest, agreement, etc., of the person or persons addressed\" as in, \"It's four kilometres away, eh, so I have to go by bike.\" In that case, ''eh?'' is used to confirm the attention of the listener and to invite a supportive noise such as ''mm'' or ''oh'' or ''okay''. This usage is also common in [[Queensland]], Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Other uses of ''eh''&nbsp;\u2013 for instance, in place of ''huh?'' or ''what?'' meaning \"please repeat or say again\"&nbsp;\u2013 are also found in parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Australia]]. It is common in Northern/Central [[Ontario]], the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]]. The word ''eh'' is used quite frequently in the North Central dialect, so a Canadian accent is often perceived in people from [[North Dakota]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]].\n\n[[File:Curtiss JN-4 CAN.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian-built Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" training biplane of 1918, with a differing vertical tail to the original U.S. version]]\nThe term ''Canuck'' simply means ''Canadian'' in its [[demonym]]ic form, and, as a term used even by Canadians themselves, it is not considered derogatory. In the 19th century and early 20th century it tended to refer to [[French-Canadian]]s, while the only Canadian-built version of the popular World War I-era American [[Curtiss JN-4]] ''Jenny'' training biplane aircraft, the JN-4C, got the \"Canuck\" nickname, 1,260 of which were built. The nickname [[Janey Canuck]] was used by Anglophone women's rights writer [[Emily Murphy]] in the 1920s and the ''[[Johnny Canuck]]'' comic book character of the 1940s. Throughout the 1970s, Canada's winning World Cup men's downhill ski team was called the \"[[Crazy Canucks]]\" for their fearlessness on the slopes.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/sports/skiing/the-crazy-canucks-canadas-skiing-heroes/topic---the-crazy-canucks-canadas-skiing-heroes.html\n| title      = The Crazy Canucks: Canada's Skiing Heroes\n| publisher  = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\n| accessdate = 25 September 2012\n}}</ref> It is also the name of the [[Vancouver Canucks]], the [[National Hockey League]] team of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\nThe term ''[[hoser]]'', popularized by [[Bob & Doug McKenzie]], typically refers to an uncouth, beer-swilling male and is a euphemism for \"loser\" coming from the earlier days of hockey played on an outdoor rink and the losing team would have to hose down the ice after the game so it refreezes smooth.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Bob & Doug also popularized the use of ''Beauty, eh'', another western slang term which may be used in variety of ways. This describes something as being of interest, of note, signals approval or simply draws attention to it. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nA ''Newf'' or ''Newfie'' is someone from Newfoundland and Labrador; sometimes considered derogatory. In Newfoundland, the term ''Mainlander'' refers to any Canadian (sometimes American, occasionally Labradorian) not from the [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]]. ''Mainlander'' is also occasionally used derogatorily.\n\nIn the Maritimes, a ''Caper'' or \"Cape Bretoner\" is someone from [[Cape Breton Island]], a ''Bluenoser'' is someone with a thick, usually southern Nova Scotia accent or as a general term for a Nova Scotian (Including Cape Bretoners), while an ''Islander'' is someone from [[Prince Edward Island]] (the same term is used in [[British Columbia]] for people from [[Vancouver Island]], or the numerous islands along it). A ''Haligonian'' refers to someone from the city of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].\n\n=== Other Canadianisms ===\n* The alphanumeric code appended to mail addresses (the equivalent of the similar British [[postcode]] and the numeric-only American [[ZIP code]]) is called a ''[[Canadian postal code|postal code]]''.\n* The term ''[[First Nations]]'' is often used in Canada to refer to what are called American Indians or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the United States. This term does {{em|not}} include the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] and [[Inuit]], however; the term [[aboriginal peoples]] (and sometimes spelled with a capital \"A\": \"Aboriginal peoples\") is preferred when all three groups are included. The term ''[[Eskimo]]'' has been replaced by the term Inuit in the past few decades. It is now considered offensive to use the term ''Eskimo'', but is still used commonly (without pejorative intent) by those born in the early-mid-20th century.\n* \"Going camping\" still refers to staying in a [[tent]] in a [[campground]] or wilderness area, while \"going out to camp\" may refer to a summer cottage or home in a rural area. \"Going to camp\" refers to children's [[summer camp]]s. In British Columbia, \"camp\" was used as a reference for certain company towns (for example, [[Bridge River, British Columbia|Bridge River]]). It is used in western Canada to refer to logging and mining camps such as [[Juskatla Camp]]. It is also a synonym for a mining district; the latter occurs in names such as Camp McKinney and usages such as \"Cariboo gold camp\" and \"Slocan mining camp\" for the Cariboo goldfields and Slocan silver-galena mining district, respectively. A \"cottage\" in British Columbia is generally a small house, perhaps with an English design or flavour, while in southern Ontario it more likely means a [[Vacation property|second home]] on a lake. Similarly, \"chalet\" \u2013 originally a term for a small warming hut&nbsp;\u2013 can mean a second home of any size, but refers to one located in a ski resort. In Northern Ontario, these second homes tend to be called \"camps\". In Western Canada, these second homes tend to be called \"cabins\".  A \"bunkie\" is a secondary building at these second homes that are small enough to require no building permits and house extra guests visiting.\n* One of the other distinctions between Canadian English and British English is the use of the phrase \"try to + infinitive\" versus the use of the phrase \"try and + infinitive\". Canadian English uses \"try to\" while British English uses \"try and\". The subordinate word, \"to\" or \"and.\" Originally, the distinction did not exist, but through the evolution of the French term ''trier'', meaning 'pick out', 'separate', or 'distinguish' into the English ''try'', a number of meanings were adopted along the way, including 'attempt'. Canadian English speakers use \"try and\" 30% of the time while British English speakers use it 73% of the time. However, since the 2000s, the two terms have begun to see equally frequent usage in British English.<ref>Brooke, Marisa & Tagliamonte, Sali, (2016) ''Why Does Canadian English Use Try To But British English Use Try And? Let's Try And/To Figure It Out'', University of Toronto</ref>\n* A ''stagette'' is a female bachelorette party (US) or hen party (UK).\n* A \"shag\" is thought, erroneously, to be derived from \"shower\" and \"stag\", and describes a dance where alcohol, entry tickets, raffle tickets, and so on, are sold to raise money for the engaged couple's wedding.

In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]]. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of [[Prague]], but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The [[Moravian dialects]] spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\n\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten [[monophthong]]s, three [[diphthong]]s and 25 consonants (divided into \"hard\", \"neutral\" and \"soft\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a [[raised alveolar trill]], which is not known to occur as a [[phoneme]] in any other language, represented by the [[grapheme]] ''[[\u0159]]''. Czech uses a simple [[orthography]] which [[phonology|phonologists]] have used as a model.\n\n==Classification==\n{{further information|Czech-Slovak languages|West Slavic}}\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Czech within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family.

The West Slavic polity of  [[Great Moravia]] formed by the 9th century. The [[Christianization of Bohemia]] took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the [[Czech-Slovak languages|Czech-Slovak]] group within [[West Slavic]] began around that time, marked among other things by  its ephemeral use of the [[voiced velar fricative]] consonant (/\u0263/)<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=112}}</ref> and consistent stress on the first syllable.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=153}}</ref>\n\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries.

Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A [[nominative\u2013accusative language]], Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position ([[dative case]]) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number:<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 25\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=25}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No. || Ordinal name (Czech) || Full name (Czech) || Case || Main usage\n|-\n|1. || ''prvn\u00ed p\u00e1d'' || ''nominativ'' ||[[nominative case|nominative]] || Subjects\n|-\n|2. || ''druh\u00fd p\u00e1d'' || ''genitiv'' ||[[genitive case|genitive]] || Belonging, movement away from something (or someone)\n|-\n|3. || ''t\u0159et\u00ed p\u00e1d'' || ''dativ'' ||[[dative case|dative]] || [[Indirect object]]s, movement toward something (or someone)\n|-\n|4. || ''\u010dtvrt\u00fd p\u00e1d'' || ''akuzativ'' ||[[accusative case|accusative]] || [[Direct object]]s\n|-\n|5. || ''p\u00e1t\u00fd p\u00e1d'' || ''vokativ'' ||[[vocative case|vocative]] || Addressing someone\n|-\n|6. || ''\u0161est\u00fd p\u00e1d'' || ''lok\u00e1l'' ||[[locative case|locative]] || Location\n|-\n|7. || ''sedm\u00fd p\u00e1d'' || ''instrument\u00e1l'' ||[[instrumental case|instrumental]] || Being used for a task; acting with someone (or something)\n|}\nSome Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or [[Russian language|Russian]]. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 25\"/>\n\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, ''[[wikt:od|od]]'' (from, away from) and ''[[wikt:z#Czech|z]]'' (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; ''[[wikt:na#Czech|na]]'' means \"onto\" or \"for\" with the accusative case, but \"on\" with the locative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=201\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nExamples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow.

With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in ''-a'', ''-e'', or consonant; neuter nouns in ''-o'', ''-e'', or ''-\u00ed'', and masculine nouns in a consonant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=22\u201324}}</ref> Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=51}}</ref> The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, ''d\u011blal'' (he did, or made); ''d\u011blala'' (she did, or made) and ''d\u011blalo'' (it did, or made).<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=141}}</ref>\n\nNouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]], distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The [[Czech koruna]] is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=114}}</ref>\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!English\n!Czech\n|-\n| one crown\n| ''jedna koruna''\n|-\n| two crowns\n| ''dv\u011b koruny''\n|-\n| three crowns\n| ''t\u0159i koruny''\n|-\n| four crowns\n| ''\u010dty\u0159i koruny''\n|-\n| five crowns\n| ''p\u011bt korun''\n|}\n\nNumerical words decline for case and, for numbers one and two, for gender.

Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ''[[wikt:ruka|ruka]]'' (hand)\u2014''ruce'' (nominative); ''[[wikt:noha|noha]]'' (leg)\u2014''nohama'' (instrumental), ''nohou'' (genitive/locative); ''[[wikt:oko|oko]]'' (eye)\u2014''o\u010di'', and ''[[wikt:ucho|ucho]]'' (ear)\u2014''u\u0161i''. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=40}}</ref> These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in ''mezi \u010dty\u0159ma o\u010dima'' (face to face, lit. ''among four eyes''). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, ''nohy'' (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kom\u00e1rek|2012|p=238}}</ref>\n\n====Verb conjugation====\n{{Main article|Czech conjugation|Morphological classification of Czech verbs}}\n{{See also|Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages}}\nCzech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third) and [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), and are  conjugated for tense (past, present or [[future tense|future]]). For example, the conjugated verb ''[[wikt:mluvit|mluv\u00edme]]'' (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the [[infinitive]] ''mluvit'' by its ending, ''-\u00edme''.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\"/>\n\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two [[grammatical aspect]]s: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs\u2014for example, ''[[wikt:koupit|koupit]]'' (perfective) and ''[[wikt:kupovat|kupovat]]'' (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from [[past tense|past]] and [[present tense]],<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=146}}</ref> and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=131}}</ref> Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\"/>\n\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix\u2014for example, the imperfective ''ps\u00e1t'' (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective ''napsat'' (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are ''na-'', ''o-'', ''po-'', ''s-'', ''u-'', ''vy-'', ''z-'' and ''za-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=147}}</ref> In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs ''koupit'' (to buy) and ''prodat'' (to sell) have the imperfective forms ''kupovat'' and ''prod\u00e1vat''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=147\u2013148}}</ref> Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and [[frequentative]] forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb ''j\u00edt'' (to go) has the iterative form ''chodit'' (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form ''chod\u00edvat'' (to go regularly).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luke\u0161|first1=Dominik|publisher=DominikLuke\u0161.net|title=Gramatick\u00e1 terminologie ve vyu\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed - Terminologie a platonick\u00fd sv\u011bt gramatick\u00fdch idej\u00ed|url=http://www.dominiklukes.net/bibliography/platonickysvetgramatickychkategorii|accessdate=August 5, 2014|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of being\u2014''[[wikt:b\u00fdt|b\u00fdt]]'' (to be), ''[[wikt:cht\u00edt|cht\u00edt]]'' (to want), ''[[wikt:moct|moct]]'' (to be able to), ''[[wikt:le\u017eet|le\u017eet]]'' (to lie down, to be lying down)\u2014have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of change\u2014for example, ''[[wikt:ot\u011bhotn\u011bt|ot\u011bhotn\u011bt]]'' (to become pregnant) and ''[[wikt:nadchnout se|nadchnout se]]'' (to become enthusiastic)\u2014have no imperfective aspect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=149}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English [[present perfect]] and [[Pluperfect|past perfect]]; ''ona b\u011b\u017eela'' could mean ''she ran'', ''she has run'' or ''she had run''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=140}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+Conjugation of ''b\u00fdt'' in future tense\n|-\n!Person\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!1.\n| ''budu''\n| ''budeme''\n|-\n!2.\n| ''bude\u0161''\n| ''budete''\n|-\n!3.\n| ''bude''\n| ''budou''\n|}\n\nIn some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English [[present perfect]]) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=150}}</ref> As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of ''b\u00fdt'' (as shown in the table at left<!-- Please change directions here if moving table -->) is placed before the infinitive (for example, ''budu j\u00edst''\u2014\"I will eat\").<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 151\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=151}}</ref>\n\nThis conjugation is not followed by ''b\u00fdt'' itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit ''b\u00fdt''. \"I will be happy\" is translated as ''Budu \u0161\u0165astn\u00fd'' (not ''Budu b\u00fdt \u0161\u0165astn\u00fd'').<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 151\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Conditional form of ''[[wikt:koupit|koupit]]'' (to buy)\n|-\n!Person\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!1.\n| ''koupil/a bych''\n| ''koupili/y bychom''\n|-\n!2.\n| ''koupil/a bys''\n| ''koupili/y byste'' \n|-\n!3.\n| ''koupil/a/o by''\n| ''koupili/y/a by''\n|}\n\nThe infinitive form ends in ''t'' (archaically, ''ti'').

typhi]]'' has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.  Chloramphenicol may be used as a second-line agent in the treatment of [[tetracycline]]-resistant [[cholera]].\n\nIt is useful in the treatment of brain abscesses caused by mixed organism infections, or when the causative organism is not known.\nChloramphenicol is active against the three main bacterial causes of [[meningitis]]: ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. In low-income countries, the WHO no longer recommends oily chloramphenicol as first-line to treat meningitis, but recognises it may be used with caution if there are no available alternatives.<ref name=\"WHOMeningitis\">{{cite web|title=WHO meningitis epidemic guidelines Africa|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|accessdate=29 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305134645/http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nChloramphenicol has been used in the U.S. in the initial [[empirical treatment]] of children with fever and a [[petechial rash]], when the [[differential diagnosis]] includes both ''Neisseria meningitidis'' [[sepsis]] and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], pending the results of diagnostic investigations.\n\nChloramphenicol is also effective against ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'', which has led to its being considered for treatment of [[vancomycin-resistant enterococcus]].\n\nIn the context of preventing [[endophthalmitis]], a complication of [[cataract]] surgery, a 2017 systematic review found moderate evidence that using chloramphenicol eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection ([[cefuroxime]] or [[penicillin]]) will likely lower the risk of endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or antibiotic injections alone.<ref name=\"Gower\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Gower EW, Lindsley K, Tulenko SE, Nanji AA, Leyngold I, McDonnell PJ |title= Perioperative antibiotics for prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= 2|issue=2|pages= CD006364 |date=2017 |pmid= 28192644|pmc= 5375161 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006364.pub3}}</ref>\n\n===Spectrum===\nChloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis etc. caused by a number of bacteria including ''Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Escherichia coli''.

It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol ''in vitro'' by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  High-level resistance is conferred by the ''cat''-gene; this [[gene]] codes for an [[enzyme]] called [[chloramphenicol acetyltransferase]], which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two [[acetyl]] groups, derived from acetyl-''S''-coenzyme A, to the [[hydroxyl]] groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.\n\nChloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  One example is the [[ACCoT]] plasmid (A=[[ampicillin]], C=chloramphenicol, Co=[[co-trimoxazole]], T=[[tetracycline]]), which mediates [[multiple drug resistance]] in typhoid (also called [[R factors]]).\n\nAs of 2014 some ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' and'' [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' strains are resistant to chloramphenicol. Some ''[[Veillonella]]'' spp. and ''[[Staphylococcus capitis]]'' strains have also developed resistance to chloramphenicol to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211211304/http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Adverse effects==\n\n===Aplastic anemia===\n\nThe most serious [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of chloramphenicol treatment is [[aplastic anaemia]].

If this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.<ref name=\"Drug Insert from DailyMed\" />\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nChloramphenicol is extremely lipid-soluble; it remains relatively [[plasma protein binding|unbound to protein]] and is a small molecule. It has a large apparent [[volume of distribution]] and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  Distribution is not uniform, with highest concentrations found in the liver and kidney, with lowest in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid.<ref name=\"Drug Insert from DailyMed\" />  The concentration achieved in brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] <!-- (CSF) --> is around 30 to 50% of the overall average body concentration, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.\n\nChloramphenicol increases the absorption of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Pill Book, The | title = Iron Supplements | pages = 593\u2013596 |editor1=Harold M.

In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced. No standard dose reduction exists for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.\n\nThe majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  Chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous [[prodrug]] form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nChloramphenicol passes into [[breast milk]], so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.<ref name=kidsgrowth>[http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623011707/http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 |date=2007-06-23 }} Retrieved on June 19, 2009</ref>\n\n===Dose monitoring===\n[[Blood plasma|Plasma]] levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and patients with abnormal liver function.

to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dada]]ists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n==Technique==\nThe cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:\n\n*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text, such as in poems by [[Tristan Tzara]] as described in his short text, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1920\">{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=12 December 1920 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}</ref>\n*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page, such as in ''[[The Third Mind]]''. It is [[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin|Gysin]]'s joint development.<ref>Laura Caruso. William Burroughs, the infinite groundbreaker. Buenos Aires Herald. buenosairesherald.com.</ref>\n\n==History in literature==\nA precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, ''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'' under the sub-title, ''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in-vacua.com/tzara.shtml|title=Tzara Combinations|author=|date=|website=www.in-vacua.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1920\"/>\n\nWilliam Burroughs cited [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) and [[John Dos Passos]]' [[U.S.A. trilogy]], which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.\n\n[[Gil J. Wolman]] developed cut-up techniques as part of his [[lettrism|lettrist]] practice in the early 1950s.\n\nAlso in the 1950s, painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]] more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book ''Minutes to Go'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet [[Sinclair Beiles]] also used this technique and co-authored ''Minutes To Go''.\n\nGysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text.  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, \"When you cut into the present the future leaks out.\"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r541727|pure_url=yes}} Break Through in Grey Room]</ref> Burroughs also further developed the \"fold-in\" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published ''[[The Third Mind]]'', a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication ''[[My Own Mag]]'' was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.\n\nIn an interview, [[Alan Burns (author)|Alan Burns]] noted that for ''Europe After The Rain'' (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: \"I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&GCOI=15647100621780&extrasfile=A09F77F7-B0D0-B086-B615C61B62D698F2.html |author=David W.

Bergerson]] and [[J. A. Lindon]] developed a cut-up technique known as [[vocabularyclept poetry]], in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Ben |authorlink=Howard Bergerson |date=February 1969 |title=Some Neglected Ways of Words |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol2/iss1/4/ |journal=[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Periodicals]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14\u201319 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><!-- \"Ben Rogers\" is an anagrammatic pseudonym of \"Bergerson\" --><ref name=\"lindon1\">{{cite journal |last=Lindon |first=J.

In her late 1970s novel ''[[Blood and Guts in High School]]'', Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.\n\n==History in film==\n[[Antony Balch]] and Burroughs created a collaboration film, ''The Cut-Ups''<ref name=\"dangerousminds1\">{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/william_burroughs_antony_balch_cut_ups|title=A Complete Disorientation of the Senses: William Burroughs\u2019 and Antony Balch\u2019s \u2018Cut Ups\u2019|author=|date=16 December 2010|website=dangerousminds.net|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> that opened in London in 1967.

Most iodine, in iodide form, is in the oceans, where the iodide ions oxidize to elemental iodine, which then enters the atmosphere and falls to earth as rain, introducing iodine to soils. Earth deficient in iodine is most common inland and in mountainous areas and areas of frequent flooding, but can also occur in coastal regions owing to past glaciation, and leaching by snow, water and heavy rainfall, which removes iodine from the soil.<ref>[http://www.thyroidmanager.org/Chapter20/20-frame.htm Chapter 20.

Cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care. Thought and reflexes are slower.\n\nOther signs may include thickened skin, enlarged tongue, or a protruding abdomen.\n\nDwarfism may also be caused by malnutrition or other hormonal deficiencies, such as insufficient growth hormone secretion, [[hypopituitarism]], decreased secretion of [[growth hormone-releasing hormone]], deficient [[growth hormone receptor]] activity and downstream causes, such as [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) deficiency.\n\n==Treatment==\n\nSporadic and genetic congenital iodine deficiency syndrome results from abnormal development or growth  of the foetal thyroid gland. This type of congenital iodine deficiency has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by [[newborn screening]] schemes followed by lifelong treatment with [[thyroxine]] (T4).\n\nThyroxine must be dosed as tablets only, even to newborns, as the liquid oral suspensions and compounded forms cannot be depended on for reliable dosing.  In the case of dosing infants, the T4 tablets are generally crushed and mixed with breast milk, formula milk or water.

There is evidence of goiter, and its medical treatment with iodine-rich algae and burnt sponges, in Chinese, Egyptian, and Roman ancient medical texts. In 1848, King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Carlo Alberto]] of [[Sardinia]] commissioned the first epidemiological study of congenital iodine deficiency syndrome, in northern [[Savoy]], where it was frequent. In past centuries, the well reported social diseases prevalent among the poorer social classes and farmers, caused by dietary and agricultural monocultures, were: [[pellagra]], [[rickets]], [[beriberi]], [[scurvy]] in long-term sailors, and the [[endemic goiter]] caused by iodine deficiency. However, this disease was less mentioned in medical books because it was erroneously considered to be an aesthetic rather than a clinical disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine Deficiency in the  Population of Montefeltro, A Territory in Central Italy Inside the Regions of Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Marche|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|volume=29 |issue=1-2 |pages=1\u201312 |year=2014 | url=http://www.pontecorboli.com/digital1/inte-journal-of-anthropology-archive/}}</ref>\nCongenital iodine deficiency syndrome was especially common in areas of southern Europe around the Alps and was often described by ancient Roman writers and depicted by artists. The earliest Alpine mountain climbers sometimes came upon whole villages with it.<ref>Fergus Fleming, ''Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps'', 2000, Grove Press, p. 179</ref> The prevalence of the condition was described from a medical perspective by several travellers and physicians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref>See, for example, [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]], \"Account of the [[Valais|Vallais]], and of the Goiters and Idiots of that Country,\" ''Universal Magazine of Knowledge & Pleasure'', vol. 67, Dec. 2, 1780.</ref>  At that time the cause was not known and it was often attributed to \"stagnant air\" in mountain valleys or \"bad water\". The proportion of people affected varied markedly throughout southern Europe and even within very small areas it might be common in one valley and not another. The number of severely affected persons was always a minority, and most persons were only affected to the extent of having a goitre and some degree of reduced cognition and growth. The majority of such cases were still socially functional in their pastoral villages.\n\nMore mildly affected areas of Europe and North America in the 19th century were referred to as \"goitre belts\". The degree of iodine deficiency was milder and manifested primarily as thyroid enlargement rather than severe mental and physical impairment. In Switzerland, for example, where soil does not contain a large amount of iodine, cases of congenital iodine deficiency syndrome were very abundant and even considered genetically caused. As the variety of food sources dramatically increased in Europe and North America and the populations became less completely dependent on locally grown food, the prevalence of endemic goitre diminished.\n\nThe early 20th century saw the discovery of the relationships of neurological impairment with hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency. Both have been largely eliminated in the developed world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''cretin'' was once used to describe a person affected by this condition, but, as with words such as ''[[spastic]]'', and ''[[lunatic]]'', it is now considered derogatory and inappropriate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Robert B.|title=White Coat Tales: Medicine's Heroes, Heritage, and Misadventures|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0-387-73080-X|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNLk6ArybNoC&lpg=PA83&dq=cretin%20cretinism%20pejorative&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> ''Cretin'' became a medical term in the 18th century, from an [[Occitan]] and an [[Alps|Alpine]] [[French language|French]] expression, prevalent in a region where persons with such a condition were especially common (see below); it saw wide medical use in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was actually a \"tick box\" category on Victorian-era census forms in the UK. The term spread more widely in popular English as a markedly derogatory term for a person who behaves stupidly. Because of its pejorative connotations in popular speech, health-care workers have mostly abandoned the term \"cretin\".\n\nThe etymology of ''cretin'' is uncertain. Several hypotheses exist. The most common derivation provided in English dictionaries is from the Alpine French dialect pronunciation of the word ''Chr\u00e9tien'' (\"(a) [[Christian]]\"), which was a greeting there. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the translation of the French term into \"human creature\" implies that the label \"Christian\" is a reminder of the humanity of the afflicted, in contrast to brute beasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50053852 |title=cretin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=11 December 2005 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Other sources suggest that ''Christian'' describes the person's \"Christ-like\" inability to sin, stemming, in such cases, from an incapacity to distinguish right from wrong.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brockett | first = Linus P | url = http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/lib/docs/1385.htm | title = Cretins And Idiots | work = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | year = Feb 1858 | accessdate = 11 December 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Robbins and Cotran \u2013 Pathologic basis of disease 8/E | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Sauders Elsevier | year = 2004 }}</ref>\n\nOther speculative etymologies have been offered:\n*From ''creta'', Latin for ''chalk'', because of the [[pallor]] of those affected.\n*From ''cretira'', [[Graub\u00fcnden|Grison]]-[[Romansh language|Romanche]] ''creature'', from Latin ''creatus''.\n*From ''cretine'', French for ''alluvium'' (soil deposited by flowing water), an allusion to the affliction's suspected origin in inadequate soil.<ref>{{cite book | first = VC | last = Medvei | title = The History of Clinical Endocrinology | location = Pearl River, New York | publisher = Parthenon Publishing Group | year = 1993 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Cretinism}}\n*[[Congenital hypothyroidism]]\n*[[Iodine deficiency]]\n*[[Moron (psychology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 6612\n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|E|00||e|00}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|243}} \n|  ICDO           =\n|  OMIM           =\n|  MedlinePlus    =\n|  eMedicineSubj  = ped\n|  eMedicineTopic = 501\n| meshName        = Cretinism\n| meshNumber      = C05.116.099.343.347\n}}\n\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for people]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders]]\n[[Category:Thyroid disease]]\n[[Category:Endocrine-related cutaneous conditions]]", "sha1": "fyqkqj37uxnfdnhjbisr22arph9xsci"}}, {"title": "Cretin", "ns": "0", "id": "6353", "revision": {"id": "819887513", "parentid": "818638824", "timestamp": "2018-01-11T20:51:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dpleibovitz", "id": "3747202"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|cretin}}\n'''Cretin''' may refer to:\n\n* a person suffering from [[cretinism]]\n* a pejorative term for an [[idiot]]\n\n==Geography==\n* [[Cape Cretin]], a headland on the [[Huon peninsula]] in Papua New Guinea\n\n==People==\n* [[Guillaume Cr\u00e9tin]] (c. 1460 \u2013 30 November 1525), a French poet\n* [[Joseph Cr\u00e9tin]] (1799\u20131857), an American bishop\n\n== Education==\n* [[Cretin Hall]], one of the male undergraduate residence halls at the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota\n* [[Cretin-Derham Hall High School]], a co-educational Catholic high school in Minnesota\n== See also ==\n* [[Parliamentary cretinism]]\n\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for people]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "ofwmka940cqtc6r207wulhuffzj3s46"}}, {"title": "Council of Trent", "ns": "0", "id": "6354", "revision": {"id": "865697930", "parentid": "865697337", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T15:47:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "John of Reading", "id": "11308236"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]] ([[User talk:ClueBot NG|talk]]): No, ClueBot got that one wrong.

During its deliberations, the Council made the [[Vulgate]] the official example of the Biblical canon and commissioned the creation of a standard version, although this was not achieved until the 1590s.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> In 1565, a year after the Council finished its work, Pius IV issued the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)|Tridentine Creed]] (after ''Tridentum'', Trent's Latin name) and his successor [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] then issued the [[Roman Catechism]] and revisions of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Breviary]] and [[Roman Missal|Missal]] in, respectively, 1566, 1568 and 1570. These, in turn, led to the codification of the [[Tridentine Mass]], which remained the Church's primary form of the Mass for the next four hundred years.\n\nMore than three hundred years passed until the next ecumenical council, the [[First Vatican Council]], was convened in 1869.\n\n== Background information ==\n\n=== Obstacles and events before the Council's problem area ===\n[[File:Tizian 083b.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Pope Paul III, convener of the Council of Trent.]]\nOn 15 March 1517, the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] closed its activities with a number of reform proposals (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on the major problems that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, [[Martin Luther]] issued his [[95 Theses]] in [[Wittenberg]].\n\n=== A general, free council in Germany ===\nLuther's position on ecumenical councils shifted over time,<ref>{{citation | first = Hubert | last = Jedin | title = Konziliengeschichte | publisher = Herder | year = 1959 | page = 80}}</ref> but in 1520 he appealed to the German princes to oppose the papal Church, if necessary with a council in Germany,<ref>{{citation | title = An den Adel deutscher Nation | year = 1520 | language = German}}</ref> open and free of the Papacy. After the Pope condemned in ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' fifty-two of Luther's theses as [[heresy]], German opinion considered a council the best method to reconcile existing differences. German Catholics, diminished in number, hoped for a council to clarify matters.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\">Jedin 81</ref>\n\nIt took a generation for the council to materialise, partly because of papal reluctance, given that a Lutheran demand was the exclusion of the papacy from the Council, and partly because of ongoing political rivalries between France and Germany and the Turkish dangers in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\" /> Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u201334), troops of the Catholic [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Papal Rome]] in 1527, \"raping, killing, burning, stealing, the like had not been seen since the [[Vandals]]\". [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] were used for horses.<ref>Hans K\u00fchner Papstgeschichte, Fischer, Frankfurt 1960, 118</ref> This, together with the Pontiff's ambivalence between France and Germany, led to his hesitation.\n\nCharles V strongly favoured a council, but needed the support of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] of France, who attacked him militarily. Francis I generally opposed a general council due to partial support of the Protestant cause within France, and in 1533 he further complicated matters when suggesting a general council to include both Catholic and Protestant rulers of Europe that would devise a compromise between the two theological systems. This proposal met the opposition of the Pope for it gave recognition to Protestants and also elevated the secular Princes of Europe above the clergy on church matters. Faced with a Turkish attack, Charles held the support of the Protestant German rulers, all of whom delayed the opening of the Council of Trent.<ref>Jedin 79\u201382</ref>\n\n== Occasion, sessions, and attendance ==\n[[File:Council of Trent by Pasquale Cati.jpg|thumb|right|The Council, depicted by [[Pasquale Cati]] (Cati da Iesi)]]\nIn reply to the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' of [[Pope Leo X]] (1520), [[Martin Luther]] burned the document and appealed for a general council. In 1522 German [[diet (assembly)|diets]] joined in the appeal, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] seconding and pressing for a council as a means of reunifying the Church and settling the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] controversies. [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) was vehemently against the idea of a council, agreeing with [[Francis I of France]], after [[Pope Pius II]], in his bull ''[[Execrabilis]]'' (1460) and his reply to the University of Cologne (1463), set aside the theory of the supremacy of general councils laid down by the [[Council of Constance]].<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), seeing that the [[Protestant Reformation]] was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas, desired a council. Yet when he proposed the idea to his [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], it was almost unanimously opposed. Nonetheless, he sent [[nuncio]]s throughout Europe to propose the idea. Paul III issued a decree for a general council to be held in Mantua, Italy, to begin on 23 May 1537.<ref>Joseph Francis Kelly, ''The Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church: A History'', 133.</ref> Martin Luther wrote the [[Smalcald Articles]] in preparation for the general council. The Smalcald Articles were designed to sharply define where the Lutherans could and could not compromise. The council was ordered by the Emperor and Pope Paul III to convene in [[Mantua]] on 23 May 1537. It failed to convene after another war broke out between France and Charles V, resulting in a non-attendance of French [[prelate]]s. Protestants refused to attend as well. Financial difficulties in Mantua led the Pope in the autumn of 1537 to move the council to [[Vicenza]], where participation was poor. The Council was postponed indefinitely on 21 May 1539. Pope Paul III then initiated several internal Church reforms while Emperor Charles V convened with Protestants at an imperial diet in [[Regensburg]], to reconcile differences. Unity failed between Catholic and Protestant representatives \"because of different concepts of ''Church'' and ''[[Justification (theology)|justification]]''\".<ref>Jedin 85</ref>\n\nHowever, the council was delayed until 1545 and, as it happened, convened right before Luther's death. Unable, however, to resist the urging of Charles V, the pope, after proposing Mantua as the place of meeting, convened the council at Trent (at that time ruled by a prince-bishop under the [[Holy Roman Empire]]),<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> on 13 December 1545; the Pope's decision to transfer it to [[Bologna]] in March 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague<ref name=\"ODCC\"/> failed to take effect and the Council was indefinitely prorogued on 17 September 1549. None of the three popes reigning over the duration of the council ever attended, which had been a condition of Charles V. [[Papal legate]]s were appointed to represent the Papacy.<ref>O'Malley, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nReopened at Trent on 1 May 1551 by convocation of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), it was broken up by the sudden victory of [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] over the Emperor Charles V and his march into surrounding state of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] on 28 April 1552.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc12/htm/ii.ii.htm |title=Council of Trent|author=Trenkle, Franz Sales|date=3 March 2003|accessdate=22 January 2008}}</ref> There was no hope of reassembling the council while the very [[Anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]] [[Paul IV]] was Pope.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> The council was reconvened by [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565) for the last time, meeting from 18 January 1562 at [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Santa Maria Maggiore]], and continued until its final adjournment on 4 December 1563. It closed with a series of ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the papal legates, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html|title=CT25|website=history.hanover.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe history of the council is thus divided into three distinct periods: 1545\u20131549, 1551\u20131552 and 1562\u20131563. During the second period, the Protestants present asked for renewed discussion on points already defined and for bishops to be released from their oaths of allegiance to the Pope. When the last period began, all hope of conciliating the Protestants was gone and the [[Jesuits]] had become a strong force.<ref name=\"ODCC\" />\n\nThe number of attending members in the three periods varied considerably.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The council was small to begin with, opening with only about 30 bishops.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\">O'Malley, 29</ref> It increased toward the close, but never reached the number of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (which had 318 members)<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> nor of the [[First Vatican Council]] (which numbered 744). The decrees were signed in 1563 by 255 members, the highest attendance of the whole council,<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\"/> including four papal legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, and 168 bishops, two-thirds of whom were Italians. The Italian and Spanish prelates were vastly preponderant in power and numbers. At the passage of the most important decrees, not more than sixty prelates were present.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe French monarchy boycotted the entire council until the last minute; a delegation led by [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine]] finally arrived in November 1562. The first outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion#The \"first\" war (1562\u201363)|French Wars of Religion]] had been earlier in the year, and the French had experience of a significant and powerful Protestant minority, [[iconoclasm]] and tensions leading to violence in a way Italians and Spaniards did not.{{clarifyme|date=November 2017}} Among other influences, the last minute inclusion of a decree on sacred images was a French initiative, and the text, never discussed on the floor of the council or referred to council theologians, was based on a French draft.<ref>O'Malley, 32\u201336</ref>\n\n== Objectives and overall results ==\n\nThe main objectives of the council were twofold, although there were other issues that were also discussed:\n\n#To condemn the principles and doctrines of [[Protestantism]] and to clarify the doctrines of the Catholic Church on all disputed points. It is true that the emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551\u20131553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. [[Melanchthon]] and [[Johannes Brenz]], with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trent. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than [[Nuremberg]], took with him the ''Confessio Saxonica''. But the refusal to give the Protestants the vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#To effect a reformation in discipline or administration. This object had been one of the causes calling forth the reformatory councils and had been lightly touched upon by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Julius II]]. The obvious corruption in the administration of the Church was one of the numerous causes of the Reformation. Twenty-five public sessions were held, but nearly half of them were spent in solemn formalities. The chief work was done in committees or congregations. The entire management was in the hands of the papal legate. The liberal elements lost out in the debates and voting. The council abolished some of the most notorious abuses and introduced or recommended disciplinary reforms affecting the sale of [[indulgence]]s, the morals of convents, the education of the clergy, the non-residence of bishops (also bishops having plurality of [[benefice]]s, which was fairly common), and the careless [[wikt:fulmination|fulmination]] of [[censure]]s, and forbade duelling. Although evangelical sentiments were uttered by some of the members in favour of the supreme authority of the Scriptures and justification by faith, no concession whatsoever was made to Protestantism.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#The Church is the ultimate interpreter of Scripture.<ref name=\"CCC 85\">Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 85</ref> Also, the Bible and Church Tradition (the tradition that made up part of the Catholic faith) were equally and independently authoritative.\n#The relationship of faith and [[Good works|works]] in salvation was defined, following controversy over [[Martin Luther]]'s doctrine of \"[[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]\".\n#Other Catholic practices that drew the ire of reformers within the Church, such as [[indulgences]], pilgrimages, the veneration of [[saint]]s and [[relics]], and the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] were strongly reaffirmed, though abuses of them were forbidden. Decrees concerning [[Counter-Reformation#Church_music|sacred music]] and religious art, [[Catholic Church art#Council of Trent|though inexplicit, were subsequently amplified]] by theologians and writers to condemn many types of Renaissance and medieval styles and [[iconography|iconographies]], impacting heavily on the development of these art forms.\n\nThe doctrinal decisions of the council are divided into decrees (''decreta''), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar [[dogma]]s, and into short canons (''canones''), which condemn the dissenting Protestant views with the concluding ''\"anathema sit\"'' (\"let him be anathema\").<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n== Canons and decrees ==\n\nThe '''doctrinal''' acts are as follows: after reaffirming the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (third session), the [[Canon of Trent|decree]] was passed (fourth session) confirming that the [[deuterocanonical books]] were on a par with the other books of the [[biblical canon|canon]] (against Luther's placement of these books in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] of [[Luther Bible|his edition]]) and coordinating church tradition with the Scriptures as a rule of faith. The [[Vulgate]] translation was affirmed to be authoritative for the text of Scripture.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] (sixth session) was declared to be offered upon the basis of human cooperation with divine grace<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of [[Irresistible grace|passive reception of grace]]. Understanding the Protestant \"[[Sola fide|faith alone]]\" doctrine to be one of simple human confidence in divine mercy, the Council rejected the \"[[Preservation of the saints|vain confidence]]\" of the Protestants, stating that no one can know who has received the grace of God.  Furthermore, the Council affirmed\u2014against Protestant doctrine\u2014that the grace of God can be forfeited through [[mortal sin]].\n\nThe greatest weight in the Council's decrees is given to the [[sacrament]]s. The seven sacraments were reaffirmed and the [[Eucharist]] pronounced to be a true propitiatory sacrifice as well as a sacrament, in which the bread and wine were [[consecration|consecrated]] into the Eucharist (thirteenth and twenty-second sessions). The term [[transubstantiation]] was used by the Council, but the specific [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] explanation given by [[Scholasticism]] was not cited as dogmatic. Instead, the decree states that [[Jesus|Christ]] is \"really, truly, substantially present\" in the consecrated forms. The sacrifice of the [[Roman Mass|Mass]] was to be offered for dead and living alike and in giving to the apostles the command \"do this in remembrance of me,\" Christ conferred upon them a [[sacerdotal]] power. The practice of withholding the cup from the laity was confirmed (twenty-first session) as one which the [[Church Fathers]] had commanded for good and sufficient reasons; yet in certain cases the Pope was made the supreme arbiter as to whether the rule should be strictly maintained.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> On the language of the Mass, \"contrary to what is often said\", the council condemned the belief that only vernacular languages should be used, while insisting on the use of Latin.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\">O'Malley, 31</ref>\n\n[[Holy Orders|Ordination]] (twenty-third session) was defined to imprint an [[sacramental character|indelible character]] on the soul. The priesthood of the New Testament takes the place of the Levitical priesthood. To the performance of its functions, the consent of the people is not necessary.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nIn the decrees on marriage (twenty-fourth session) the excellence of the [[celibacy|celibate]] state was reaffirmed, concubinage condemned and the validity of marriage made dependent upon the wedding taking place before a priest and two witnesses, although the lack of a requirement for parental consent ended a debate that had proceeded from the 12th century. In the case of a [[divorce]], the right of the innocent party to marry again was denied so long as the other party was alive,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> even if the other party had committed adultery.  However the council \"refused \u2026 to assert the necessity or usefulness of [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]].<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\"/>\n\nIn the twenty-fifth and last session,<ref>Council of Trent: Decree ''De invocatione, veneratione et reliquiis sanctorum, et de sacris imaginibus'', 3 December 1563, Sessio 25.</ref> the doctrines of [[purgatory]], the invocation of [[saint]]s and the veneration of [[relic]]s were reaffirmed, as was also the efficacy of indulgences as dispensed by the Church according to the power given her, but with some cautionary recommendations,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> and a ban on the sale of indulgences. Short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, were to have [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|great impact]] on the development of [[Catholic Church art]]. Much more than the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787) the Council fathers of Trent stressed the pedagogical purpose of Christian images.<ref>B\u00fchren 2008, p. 635f.; about the historical context of the decree on sacred images cf. Jedin 1935.</ref>\n\nThe council appointed, in 1562 (eighteenth session), a commission to prepare a list of forbidden books (''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''), but it later left the matter to the Pope. The preparation of a [[Roman Catechism|catechism]] and the revision of the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]] and [[Missal]] were also left to the pope.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The catechism embodied the council's far-reaching results, including reforms and definitions of the sacraments, the Scriptures, church dogma, and duties of the clergy.<ref name=\"World History\" />\n\nOn adjourning, the Council asked the supreme pontiff to ratify all its decrees and definitions. This petition was complied with by [[Pope Pius IV]], on 26 January 1564, in the [[papal bull]], ''[[Benedictus Deus (Pius IV)|Benedictus Deus]]'', which enjoins strict obedience upon all Catholics and forbids, under pain of [[excommunication]], all unauthorised interpretation, reserving this to the Pope alone and threatens the disobedient with \"the indignation of Almighty God and of his blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.\" Pope Pius appointed a commission of cardinals to assist him in interpreting and enforcing the decrees.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe ''[[Index librorum prohibitorum]]'' was announced in 1564 and the following books were issued with the papal [[imprimatur]]: the Profession of the Tridentine Faith and the [[Roman Catechism|Tridentine Catechism]] (1566), the Breviary (1568), the Missal (1570) and the [[Vulgate]] (1590 and then 1592).<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe decrees of the council were acknowledged in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1566. [[Philip II of Spain]] accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily inasmuch as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. The disciplinary sections received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. No attempt was made to introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared not do it in the face of [[John Knox]] and the Reformation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThese decrees were later supplemented by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870.\n\n== Publication of documents ==\n\nThe most comprehensive history is still [[Hubert Jedin]]'s ''The History of the Council of Trent (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient)'' with about 2500 pages in four volumes: ''The History of the Council of Trent: The fight for a Council'' (Vol I, 1951); ''The History of the Council of Trent: The first Sessions in Trent (1545\u20131547)'' (Vol II, 1957); ''The History of the Council of Trent: Sessions in Bologna 1547\u20131548 and Trento 1551\u20131552'' (Vol III, 1970, 1998); ''The History of the Council of Trent: Third Period and Conclusion'' (Vol IV, 1976).\n\nThe canons and decrees of the council have been published very often and in many languages (for a large list consult ''British Museum Catalogue'', under \"Trent, Council of\"). The first issue was by [[Paulus Manutius]] (Rome, 1564). The best Latin editions are by Judocus Le Plat (Antwerp, 1779) and by [[Johann Friedrich von Schulte]] and [[Aemilius Ludwig Richter]] (Leipzig, 1853). Other good editions are in vol. vii. of the ''Acta et decreta conciliorum recentiorum. Collectio Lacensis'' (7 vols., Freiburg, 1870\u201390), reissued as independent volume (1892); ''Concilium Tridentinum: Diariorum, actorum, epistularum, \u2026 collectio'', ed. Sebastianus Merkle (4 vols., Freiburg, 1901 sqq.); not to overlook [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]], ''Concilia'', xxxv. 345 sqq. Note also [[Carl Mirbt]], ''Quellen'', 2d ed, pp.&nbsp;202\u2013255. The best English edition is by [[James Waterworth]] (London, 1848; ''With Essays on the External and Internal History of the Council'').<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe original acts and debates of the council, as prepared by its general secretary, Bishop [[Angelo Massarelli]], in six large folio volumes, are deposited in the [[Vatican Library]] and remained there unpublished for more than 300 years and were brought to light, though only in part, by [[Augustin Theiner]], priest of the oratory (d. 1874), in ''Acta genuina sancti et oecumenici Concilii Tridentini nunc primum integre edita'' (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874).<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nMost of the official documents and private reports, however, which bear upon the council, were made known in the 16th century and since. The most complete collection of them is that of J. Le Plat, ''Monumentorum ad historicam Concilii Tridentini collectio'' (7 vols., Leuven, 1781\u201387).

The main role of chloroplasts is to conduct [[photosynthesis]], where the photosynthetic pigment [[chlorophyll]] captures the [[energy]] from [[sunlight]] and converts it and stores it in the energy-storage molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] while freeing [[oxygen]] from water. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from [[carbon dioxide]] in a process known as the [[Calvin cycle]]. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including [[fatty acid synthesis]], much [[amino acid]] synthesis, and the [[immune response]] in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and [[wheat]].\n\nA chloroplast is a type of organelle known as a [[plastid]], characterized by [[Chloroplast membrane|its two membranes]] and a high concentration of [[chlorophyll]]. Other plastid types, such as the [[leucoplast]] and the [[chromoplast]], contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.\n\nChloroplasts are highly dynamic\u2014they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally [[#Chloroplast division|pinch in two]] to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], contain their own [[DNA]], which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor\u2014a photosynthetic [[cyanobacterium]] that was engulfed by an early [[eukaryotic]] cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.\n\nWith one exception (the [[amoeboid]] ''[[Paulinella]] chromatophora''), all chloroplasts can probably be traced back to a single [[endosymbiotic event]], when a cyanobacterium was engulfed by the eukaryote. Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other\u2014a consequence of many [[secondary endosymbiotic events|secondary]] and even [[tertiary endosymbiotic events]].\n\nThe word ''chloroplast'' is derived from the Greek words ''chloros'' (\u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2), which means green, and ''plastes'' (\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2), which means \"the one who forms\".<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=chloroplast|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chloroplast&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe first definitive description of a chloroplast (''Chlorophyllk\u00f6rnen'', \"grain of chlorophyll\") was given by [[Hugo von Mohl]] in 1837 as discrete bodies within the green plant cell.<ref>von Mohl, H.

As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism.<ref name=\"Krishnan\"/><ref name=\"Bendich\"/> Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.\n\nIn addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of [[deamination]] seen in cpDNA.<ref name=\"Krishnan\"/> Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes [[hypoxanthine]]. Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A \u2192 G base change).<ref name=Biocyclopedia>{{cite web|title=Effect of chemical mutagens on nucleotide sequence|url=http://www.biocyclopedia.com/index/genetics/mutations_molecular_level_mechanism/effect_of_chemical_mutagens_on_nucleotide_sequence.php|website=Biocyclopedia|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> \n[[File:Adenine Deaminates to Guanine.png|thumb|left|400px|Over time, base changes in the DNA sequence can arise from deamination mutations.

DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A \u2192 G deamination. Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time).<ref name=\"Krishnan\"/> This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination.

[[Photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]] contain [[light-harvesting complexes]] with [[chlorophyll]] and [[carotenoid]]s that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump [[hydrogen ions]] into the thylakoid space, decreasing the [[pH]] and turning it acidic. [[ATP synthase]] is a large protein complex that harnesses the [[concentration gradient]] of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma\u2014much like a dam turbine.<ref name=\"Biology 8th\u2014Campbell & Reece\u2014196\u2013197\" />\n\nThere are two types of thylakoids\u2014granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]].

Stromal thylakoids are [[helicoid]] sheets that spiral around grana.<ref name=\"The Plant Cell\u2014Thylakoid system\" /> The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat [[photosystem II]] protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and [[surface area]] for light capture.<ref name=\"The Plant Cell\u2014Thylakoid system\" />\n\nIn contrast, [[photosystem I]] and [[ATP synthase]] are large protein complexes which jut out into the stroma. They can't fit in the appressed granal membranes, and so are found in the stromal thylakoid membrane\u2014the edges of the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal thylakoids. These large protein complexes may act as spacers between the sheets of stromal thylakoids.<ref name=\"The Plant Cell\u2014Thylakoid system\" />\n\nThe number of thylakoids and the total thylakoid area of a chloroplast is influenced by light exposure.

This has the end result of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy being wasted and {{CO2}} being released, all with no sugar being produced. This is a big problem, since O{{sub|2}} is produced by the initial [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the [[Calvin cycle]] which uses RuBisCO.<ref name=\"Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201\">{{cite book|title=Biology 8th Edition Campbell & Reece|year=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson)|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n[[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]] evolved a way to solve this\u2014by spatially separating the light reactions and the Calvin cycle.

Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate [[systemic acquired resistance]], triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.<ref name=\"MPMI-AllHandsonDeck\" />\n\nIn some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] during an infection.<ref name=\"MPMI-AllHandsonDeck\" />\n\nChloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors.

It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.<ref name=\"Traffic-ChloroplastDivision\" />\n\nLight has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division. Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under [[Chlorophyll#Spectrophotometry|poor quality green light]], but are slow to complete division\u2014they require exposure to bright white light to complete division. Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.<ref name=\"RSPBChloroplastDivision\" /><ref name=\"PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivision\" />\n\n=== Chloroplast inheritance ===\nLike [[Mitochondrion#Replication and inheritance|mitochondria]], chloroplasts are usually inherited from a single parent. Biparental chloroplast inheritance\u2014where plastid genes are inherited from both parent plants\u2014occurs in very low levels in some flowering plants.<ref name=\"AJB-ChloroplastInheritance\" />\n\nMany mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast DNA inheritance, including selective destruction of chloroplasts or their genes within the [[gamete]] or [[zygote]], and chloroplasts from one parent being excluded from the embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.<ref name=\"PNAS-ChloroplastInheritance\">{{cite journal |bibcode=1995PNAS...9211331B |title=Uniparental Inheritance of Mitochondrial and Chloroplast Genes: Mechanisms and Evolution |last1=Birky |first1=C.

Most of them produce [[sperm cells]] that do not contain any plastids. There are many other documented mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance in these flowering plants, such as different rates of chloroplast replication within the embryo.<ref name=\"AJB-ChloroplastInheritance\" />\n\nAmong angiosperms, paternal chloroplast inheritance is observed more often in [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] than in offspring from parents of the same species. This suggests that incompatible hybrid genes might interfere with the mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance.<ref name=\"AJB-ChloroplastInheritance\" />\n\n==== Transplastomic plants ====\nRecently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of [[genetically modified crops]]. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, [[transgene]]s in these plastids cannot be disseminated by [[pollen]]. This makes [[plastid transformation]] a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This [[biological containment]] strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture]]. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.<ref name=ruf2007>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700008104 |title=Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation |year=2007 |last1=Ruf |first1=S. |last2=Karcher |first2=D. |last3=Bock |first3=R. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=17 |pages=6998\u20137002 |pmid=17420459 |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.6998R |pmc=1849964}}</ref>\n\n==References==<!-- MolPhylogenetEvol48:23,48:176,48:313 -->\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Plastid endosymbiosis\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jxb/erq411 |title=The evolution of glycogen and starch metabolism in eukaryotes gives molecular clues to understand the establishment of plastid endosymbiosis |year=2011 |last1=Ball |first1=S. |last2=Colleoni |first2=C. |last3=Cenci |first3=U. |last4=Raj |first4=J.

It is among the most easily distinguished constellations, as all of its four main stars have an [[apparent visual magnitude]] brighter than +2.8, even though it is the [[List of constellations by area|smallest]] of all [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[cross]], and it is dominated by a cross-shaped or kite-like [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that is commonly known as the '''Southern Cross'''.\n \nPredominating is the first-magnitude blue-white star of [[Alpha Crucis]] or Acrux, being the constellation's brightest and most southerly member. Crux is followed by four dominant stars, descending in clockwise order by magnitude: [[Beta Crucis|Beta]], [[Gamma Crucis|Gamma]] (one of the closest [[red giant]]s to Earth), [[Delta Crucis|Delta]] and [[Epsilon Crucis]]. Many of these brighter stars are members of the [[Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association]], a large but loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share common origins and motion across the southern [[Milky Way]]. The constellation contains four [[Classical Cepheid variable|Cepheid variables]] that are each visible to the naked eye under optimum conditions. Crux also contains the bright and colourful [[open cluster]] known as the [[Jewel Box (star cluster)|Jewel Box]] (NGC 4755) and, to the southwest, partly includes the extensive [[dark nebula]], known as the [[Coalsack Nebula]].\n\n==History==\nThe stars within Crux were known to the [[Ancient Greeks]], where [[Ptolemy]] regarded them as part of the constellation Centaurus.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pasachoff, |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&id=aKPWAAAAMAAJ&q=crux#search_anchor |title=Stars and Planets |year=2006 |page=144}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Staal, |title=[no title cited] |url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=arGqPIrw6twC&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=crux |year=1998 |page=247}}</ref> They were entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC.

Both authors, however, depended on unreliable sources and placed Crux in the wrong position. Crux was first shown in its correct position on the celestial globes of [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]] in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by [[Frederick de Houtman]] in 1603.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/crux.htm |title=Ian Ridpath\u2019s Star Tales \u2013 Crux |access-date=5 August 2013}}</ref> The constellation was later adopted by [[Jakob Bartsch]] in 1624 and [[Augustin Royer]] in 1679.

Crux is exactly opposite to [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in the sky with the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34\u00b0S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky.\n\nCrux is sometimes confused with the nearby [[Vela (constellation)#False Cross|False Cross]] by stargazers. Crux is somewhat [[kite (geometry)|kite]]-shaped (a [[Latin cross]]), and it has a fifth star ([[Epsilon Crucis|\u03b5 Crucis]]). The False Cross is [[diamond]]-shaped (a [[Greek cross]]), somewhat dimmer on average, does not have a fifth star and lacks the two prominent nearby \"Pointer Stars\".\n\n==Visibility==\n[[File:Deep Crux wide field with fog.jpg|left|thumb|Deep exposure of Crux, [[Coalsack Nebula]], and [[IC 2944]]]]\n[[File:Crux-23x2min-20160301.jpg|left|thumb|Stacked 2 minute exposure of Crux]]\nCrux is easily visible from the [[southern hemisphere]] at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from [[Tropics|tropical latitudes]] of the [[northern hemisphere]] for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from [[Cancun]] or any other place at latitude 25\u00b0 N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.<ref>{{cite book | title=Field Guide to the Stars and Planets | author=Pasachoff, Jay M | year=2000 | publisher=Houghton Miflin | isbn=978-0-395-93431-9 | page=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Ian Ridpath.com: Constellations | accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref> There are 5 main stars.\nDue to [[precession]], Crux will move closer to the South Pole in the next millennia, up to 67 degrees south declination for the middle of the constellation. But in AD 18000 or BC 8000 Crux will be and was less than 30 degrees south declination making it visible in Northern Europe.

Alpha and Gamma (known as [[Acrux]] and [[Gacrux]], respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Tracing a line from Gacrux to Acrux leads to a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=134\u2013135}} Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri]], the point where the above-mentioned line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial Pole. Another way to find south, strike line through Gacrux and Acrux, 4 1/2 times the distance between Gacrux and Acrux, directly below that point is south. The two stars of Alpha and Beta Centauri are often referred to as the \"Southern Pointers\" or just \"The Pointers\", allowing people to easily find the asterism of the Southern Cross or the constellation of Crux.  Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation [[Musca]] is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.<ref name= Grainger/>\n\nA technique used in the field is to clench one's right fist and to view the cross, aligning the first knuckle with the axis of the cross.

({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|i\u02d0|t|\u0259|s}}) is a [[constellation]]. Its name refers to [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a [[sea monster]] in [[Greek mythology]], although it is often called 'the [[whale]]' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].\n\n==Features==\n[[Image:CetusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Cetus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]\n\n===Ecliptic===\nAlthough Cetus is not generally considered part of the [[zodiac]], the [[ecliptic]] passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time.  This is all the more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater [[inclination]] to the ecliptic than the moon and planets.\n\n[[Astronomy on Mars#Celestial poles and ecliptic|As seen from Mars]], the ecliptic passes into Cetus, with the sun appearing in Cetus for around six days shortly after the northern summer solstice. Mars's orbit is tilted by 1.85\u00b0 with respect to Earth's.\n\n===Stars===\n{{main article|List of stars in Cetus}}\n[[Mira]] (\"the Wonderful\"), designated [[Omicron Ceti]], was the first [[variable star]] to be discovered and the prototype of [[Mira variable|its class]]. Over a period of 332 days it reaches a maximum [[apparent magnitude]] of 3 - visible to the naked eye - and dips to a minimum magnitude of 10, invisible to the unaided eye. Its seeming appearance and disappearance gave it its common name, which means \"the amazing one\". Mira [[pulsating variable|pulsates]] with a minimum size of 400 solar diameters and a maximum size of 500 solar diameters. 420 light-years from Earth, it was discovered by [[David Fabricius]] in 1596.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}\n\n[[Alpha Ceti|\u03b1 Ceti]], traditionally called Menkar (\"the nose\"), is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 220 light-years from Earth. It is a wide [[double star]]; the secondary is [[93 Ceti]], a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.6, 440 light-years away. [[Beta Ceti|\u03b2 Ceti]], also called Deneb Kaitos and Diphda, is the brightest star in Cetus. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.0, 96 light-years from Earth. The traditional name \"Deneb Kaitos\" means \"the whale's tail\". [[Gamma Ceti|\u03b3 Ceti]], Kaffaljidhma (\"head of the whale\") is a very close double star. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5, 82 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} [[Tau Ceti]] is noted for being the nearest [[Sun-like star]] at a distance of 11.9 light-years. It is a yellow-hued [[main-sequence star]] of magnitude 3.5.\n\n[[AA Ceti]] is a triple star system; the brightest member has a magnitude of 6.2. The primary and secondary are separated by 8.4 arcseconds at an angle of 304 degrees. The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes in front of the primary and causes the system's apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=67}} [[UV Ceti]] is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two [[red dwarfs]]. both of magnitude 13. One of the stars is a [[flare star]], which are prone to sudden, random outbursts that last several minutes; these increase the pair's apparent brightness significantly - as high as magnitude 7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\n[[File:Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.jpg|thumb|Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hubble observes the hidden depths of Messier 77|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1305/|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Himmelsglob, 1602 - Skoklosters slott - 102439.tif|thumb|Cetus by Willem Blaeu, 1602.]]\nCetus lies far from the [[galactic plane]], so that many distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] are visible, unobscured by dust from the [[Milky Way]].

It is often now called the Whale, though it is most strongly associated with [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus the sea-monster]], who was slain by [[Perseus]] as he saved the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Poseidon]]'s wrath. Cetus is located in a region of the sky called \"The Sea\" because many water-associated constellations are placed there, including [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], [[Capricornus]], and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].<ref name=\"staal\">{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\nCetus has been depicted many ways throughout its history. In the 17th century, Cetus was depicted as a \"dragon fish\" by [[Johann Bayer]]. Both [[Willem Blaeu]] and [[Andreas Cellarius]] depicted Cetus as a whale-like creature in the same century. However, Cetus has also been variously depicted with animal heads attached to a piscine body.<ref name=\"staal\"/>\n\n===In global astronomy===\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Cetus are found among two areas: the [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, ''B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4'') and the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (\u897f\u65b9\u767d\u864e, ''X\u012b F\u0101ng B\u00e1i H\u01d4'').\n\nThe Brazilian [[Tukano]] and [[Kobeua]] people used the stars of Cetus to create a [[jaguar]], representing the god of hurricanes and other violent storms. Lambda, Mu, Xi, Nu, Gamma, and Alpha Ceti represented its head; Omicron, Zeta, and Chi Ceti represented its body; Eta Eri, Tau Cet, and Upsilon Cet marked its legs and feet; and Theta, Eta, and  Beta Ceti delineated its tail.<ref name=\"staal\"/>\n\nIn [[Hawaii]], the constellation was called ''Na Kuhi'', and Mira (Omicron Ceti) may have been called ''Kane''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}\n\n==Namesakes==\n[[USS Cetus (AK-77)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cetus (Chinese astronomy)]]\n*[[Book of Jonah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |first = David H. |last = Levy |title = Deep Sky Objects |publisher = [[Prometheus Books]] |year = 2005 |isbn = 1-59102-361-0 |ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Makemson\n  | first = Maud Worcester\n  | year = 1941\n  | publisher = [[Yale University Press]]\n  | title = The Morning Star Rises: an account of Polynesian astronomy\t\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{citation |title = Stars and Planets Guide |last1 = Ridpath |first1 = Ian |last2 = Tirion |first2 = Wil |year = 2001 |publisher = Princeton University Press |isbn = 0-691-08913-2}}\n* Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion (2007).

Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[keel]] of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of [[Argo Navis]] (the ship ''Argo'') until that constellation was divided into three pieces, the other two being [[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]] (the [[poop deck]]), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the sails of the ship).\n\n== History and mythology ==\nCarina was once a part of [[Argo Navis]], the great ship of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] who searched for the [[Golden Fleece]]. The constellation of Argo was introduced in [[ancient Greece]]. However, due to the massive size of Argo Navis and the sheer number of stars that required separate designation, [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] divided Argo into three sections in 1763, including Carina (the keel).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}} In the 19th century, these three became established as separate constellations, and were formally included in the list of 88 modern IAU constellations in 1930.<ref name=iau>{{cite book |last1=Delporte |first1=E. |year=1930 |title=Delimitation scientifique des constellations (tables et cartes) |bibcode=1930dsct.book.....D |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> Lacaille kept a single set of Greek letters for the whole of Argo, and separate sets of Latin letter designations for each of the three sections.

Alpha Carinae, as Canopus is formally designated, is a [[variable star]] that varies by approximately 0.1 magnitudes. Its traditional name comes from the mythological [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], who was a navigator for [[Menelaus]], king of Sparta.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nThere are several other stars above magnitude 3 in Carina. [[Beta Carinae]], traditionally called Miaplacidus, is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.7, 111 light-years from Earth. [[Epsilon Carinae]] is an orange-hued giant star similarly bright to Miaplacidus at magnitude 1.9; it is 630 light-years from Earth. Another fairly bright star is the blue-white hued [[Theta Carinae]]; it is a magnitude 2.7 star 440 light-years from Earth. Theta Carinae is also the most prominent member of the cluster [[IC 2602]]. [[Iota Carinae]] is a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 2.2, 690 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\n[[Eta Carinae]] is the most prominent [[variable star]] in Carina; with a mass of approximately 100 [[solar mass]]es and 4 million times as bright as the Sun.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}} It was first discovered to be unusual in 1677, when its magnitude suddenly rose to 4, attracting the attention of [[Edmond Halley]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} Eta Carinae is inside [[NGC 3372]], commonly called the Carina Nebula.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}} It had a long outburst in 1827, when it brightened to magnitude 1, only fading to magnitude 1.5 in 1828. Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of [[Sirius]]; it brightened to magnitude \u22121.5 in 1843. However, since 1843, Eta Carinae has remained relatively placid, having a magnitude between 6.5 and 7.9.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} However, in 1998, it brightened again, though only to magnitude 5.0, a far less drastic outburst. Eta Carinae is a [[binary star]], with a companion that has a period of 5.5 years; the two stars are surrounded by the [[Homunculus Nebula]], which is composed of gas that was ejected in 1843.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nThere are several less prominent variable stars in Carina. [[HD 84810|l Carinae]] is a [[Cepheid variable]] noted for its brightness; it is the brightest Cepheid that is variable to the unaided eye. It is a yellow-hued supergiant star with a minimum magnitude of 4.2 and a maximum magnitude of 3.3; it has a period of 35.5 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nTwo bright [[Mira variable]] stars are in Carina: [[R Carinae]] and [[S Carinae]]; both stars are [[red giant]]s. R Carinae has a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 4.0. Its period is 309 days and it is 416 light-years from Earth. S Carinae is similar, with a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0. However, S Carinae has a shorter period&nbsp;\u2013 150 days, though it is much more distant at 1300 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nCarina is home to several [[double star]]s and [[binary star]]s. [[Upsilon Carinae]] is a binary star with two blue-white hued giant components, 1600 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0; the two components are distinguishable in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nTwo [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are prominent in Carina. One is known as the 'Diamond Cross', which is larger than the Southern Cross (but fainter), and, from the perspective of the southern hemisphere viewer, upside down, the long axes of the two crosses being close to parallel.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Another asterism in the constellation is the [[False Cross]], often mistaken for the Southern Cross, which is an asterism in [[Crux]]. The False Cross consists of two stars in Carina, [[Iota Carinae]] and [[Epsilon Carinae]], and two stars in Vela, [[Kappa Velorum]] and [[Delta Velorum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\n=== Deep-sky objects ===\nCarina is known for its [[Carina Nebula|namesake nebula]], NGC 3372,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=100}} discovered by French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in 1751, which contains several [[nebula]]e. The Carina Nebula overall is an extended [[emission nebula]] approximately 8,000 light-years away and 300 light-years wide that includes vast [[star formation|star-forming regions]].{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}} It has an overall magnitude of 8.0{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=101}} and an apparent diameter of over 2 degrees.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}} Its central region is called the Keyhole, or the [[Keyhole Nebula]]. This was described in 1847 by [[John Herschel]], and likened to a keyhole by Emma Converse in 1873.<ref name=appletons>{{cite book|title=Appletons' Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgMZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA818|year=1873|publisher=[[D. Appleton and Company]]|pages=818\u2013}}</ref> The Keyhole is about seven light-years wide and is composed mostly of [[ionized hydrogen]], with two major star-forming regions. The [[Homunculus Nebula]] is a [[planetary nebula]] visible to the naked eye that is being ejected by the erratic [[luminous blue variable star]] [[Eta Carinae]], the most massive visible star known. Eta Carinae is so massive that it has reached the theoretical upper limit for the mass of a star and is therefore unstable. It is known for its outbursts; in 1840 it briefly became one of the brightest stars in the sky due to a particularly massive outburst, which largely created the Homunculus Nebula. Because of this instability and history of outbursts, Eta Carinae is considered a prime [[supernova]] candidate for the next several hundred thousand years because it has reached the end of its estimated million-year life span.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}}\n\nSince the [[Milky Way]] runs through Carina, there are a large number of [[open cluster]]s in the constellation, embedded in rich star fields. [[NGC 2516]] is an open cluster that is both quite large\u2013approximately half a degree square\u2013and bright, visible to the unaided eye. It is located 1100 light-years from Earth and has approximately 80 stars, the brightest of which is a [[red giant]] star of magnitude 5.2. [[NGC 3114]] is another open cluster approximately of the same size, though it is more distant at 3000 light-years from Earth. It is more loose and dim than NGC 2516, as its brightest stars are only 6th magnitude. The most prominent open cluster in Carina is [[IC 2602]], also called the \"Southern [[Pleiades]]\". It contains [[Theta Carinae]], along with several other stars visible to the unaided eye, in total, the cluster possesses approximately 60 stars. The Southern Pleiades is particularly large for an open cluster, with a diameter of approximately one degree. Like IC 2602, [[NGC 3532]] is visible to the unaided eye and is of comparable size. It possesses approximately 150 stars that are arranged in an unusual shape, approximating an [[ellipse]] with a dark central area. Several prominent orange giants are among the cluster's bright stars, of the 7th magnitude. Superimposed on the cluster is [[Chi Carinae]], a yellow-white hued star of magnitude 3.9, far more distant than NGC 3532.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=104\u2013106}}\n\nCarina also contains the naked-eye [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 2808]]. [[Epsilon Carinae]] and [[Upsilon Carinae]] are double stars visible in small telescopes.\n\nOne noted [[galaxy cluster]] is [[1E 0657-56]], the Bullet Cluster. At a distance of 4 billion light years ([[redshift]] 0.296), this galaxy cluster is named for the [[bow shock|shock wave]] seen in the [[intracluster medium]], which resembles the shock wave of a supersonic bullet. The bow shock visible is thought to be due to the smaller galaxy cluster moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 3000\u20134000 kilometers per second to the larger cluster. Because this [[gravitational interaction]] has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years, the smaller cluster is being destroyed and will eventually merge with the larger cluster.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006|p={{page needed|date=July 2012}}}}\n\n=== Meteors ===\n\nCarina contains the radiant of the [[Eta Carinids]] meteor shower, which peaks around January 21 each year.\n\n== Equivalents ==\n\nFrom China (especially northern China), the stars of Carina can barely be seen.

[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B36599566/ ''Narrative of the expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan, 1856''.]</ref> It also ensured the safety of American [[castaway]]s and established the position of an American [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Japan. The treaty also precipitated the signing of similar treaties establishing diplomatic relations with other Western powers.\n\n==The isolation of Japan==\n\nSince the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese]] and was conducted exclusively at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] under a strict government monopoly. This policy had two main objectives. One was the fear that trade with western powers and the spread of Christianity would serve as a pretext for the invasion of Japan by imperialist forces, as had been the case with most of the nations of Asia. The second objective was fear that foreign trade and the wealth developed would lead to the rise of a ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' powerful enough to overthrow the ruling [[Tokugawa clan]].<ref name=Beasley1>W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'', p.74\u201377</ref>\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1844, King [[William II of the Netherlands]] sent a letter urging Japan to end the isolation policy on its own before change would be forced from the outside. In 1846, an official American expedition led by Commodore [[James Biddle (commodore)|James Biddle]] arrived in Japan asking for ports to be opened for trade, but was sent away.<ref name=Beasley2>W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'', p.78</ref>\n\n==The Perry expedition==\n\nIn 1853, [[United States Navy]] Commodore [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] was sent with a fleet of warships by American President [[Millard Fillmore]] to force the opening of Japanese ports to American trade, through the use of [[gunboat diplomacy]] if necessary.<ref>J. W. Hall, ''Japan'', p.207.</ref> The growing commerce between America and China, the presence of American whalers in waters offshore Japan, and the increasing monopolization of potential [[fuelling station|coaling stations]] by the British and French in Asia were all contributing factors. The Americans were also driven by concepts of [[Manifest Destiny]] and the desire to impose the benefits of western civilization on what they perceived as backward Asian nations. For the Japanese standpoint, increasing contacts with foreign warships and the increasing disparity between western military technology and the Japanese feudal armies created growing concern. The Japanese had been keeping abreast of world events via information gathered from Dutch traders in [[Dejima]] and had been forewarned by the Dutch of Perry's voyage.<ref>W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'', p.88.</ref> There was considerable internal debate in Japan on how best to meet this potential threat to Japan\u2019s economic and political sovereignty in light of events occurring in China with the [[Opium Wars]].\n\nPerry arrived with four warships at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]], at the mouth of [[Edo Bay]] on July 8, 1853. After refusing Japanese demands that he proceed to Nagasaki, which was the designated port for foreign contact, and after threatening to continue directly on to [[Edo]], the nation's capital and to burn it to the ground if necessary, he was allowed to land at nearby [[Kurihama, Yokosuka|Kurihama]] on July 14 and to deliver his letter.<ref>W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'', p.89.</ref>\n\nDespite years of debate on the isolation policy, Perry's letter created great controversy within the highest levels of the Tokugawa shogunate. The ''sh\u014dgun'' himself, [[Tokugawa Ieyoshi]] died days after Perry's departure, and was succeeded by his sickly young son, [[Tokugawa Iesada]], leaving effective administration in the hands of the Council of Elders (''[[r\u014dj\u016b]]'') led by [[Abe Masahiro]].  Abe felt that it was currently impossible for Japan to resist the American demands by military force, and yet was reluctant to take any action on his own authority for such an unprecedented situation. Attempting to legitimize any decision taken, Abe polled all of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' for their opinions. This was the first time that the Tokugawa shogunate had allowed its decision-making to be a matter of public debate, and had the unforeseen consequence of portraying the shogunate as weak and indecisive.<ref>J. W. Hall, ''Japan'',  p.211.</ref> The results of the poll also failed to provide Abe with an answer, as of the 61 known responses, 19 were in favor of accepting the American demands, and 19 were equally opposed. Of the remainder, 14 gave vague responses expressing concern of possible war, 7 suggested making temporary concessions and two advised that they would simply go along with whatever was decided.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">W. G. Beasley, ''The Meiji Restoration'', pp.90\u201395.</ref>\n\nPerry returned again on February 13, 1854, with an even larger force of eight warships, and made it clear that he would not be leaving until a treaty was signed. Negotiations began on March 8 and proceeded for around one month. The Japanese side gave in to almost all of Perry's demands, with the exception of a commercial agreement modeled after previous American treaties with China, which Perry agreed to defer to a later time. The main controversy centered on the selection of the ports to open, with Perry adamantly rejecting Nagasaki. The treaty, written in English, Dutch, Chinese and Japanese was signed on 31 March 1854 at what is now known as Kaik\u014d Hiroba (Port Opening Square) [[Yokohama]], a site adjacent to the current [[Yokohama Archives of History]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Treaty of Peace and Amity (1854)==\n[[File:KanagawaTreaty.gif|thumb|English text of the Kanagawa Treaty]]\nThe \"Japan\u2013US Treaty of Peace and Amity\" has twelve articles: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At the time, ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Iesada]] was the de facto ruler of Japan; for the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to interact in any way with foreigners was out of the question. Perry concluded the treaty with representatives of the shogun, led by plenipotentiary {{nihongo|[[Hayashi Akira]]|\u6797\u97d1}} and the text was endorsed subsequently, albeit reluctantly, by [[Emperor K\u014dmei]].<ref>Cullen, Louis M.

On the other hand, the Japanese were forced into this trade, and many saw it as a sign of weakness for the Japanese empire. The Tokugawa shogunate could point out that the treaty was not actually signed by the Shogun, or indeed any of his ''r\u014dj\u016b'', and by the agreement made, had at least temporarily averted the possibility of immediate military confrontation.<ref>W. G.

The Japanese chafed under the \"[[unequal treaty]] system\" which characterized Asian and western relations during this period.<ref>Bert Edstr\u00f6m, Bert. (2000).

Decisions to suspend previous restrictions on military activities led to re-armament by many domains and further weakened the position of the Shogun.<ref>J. W. Hall, ''Japan'', p.211\u2013213.</ref> Debate over foreign policy and popular outrage over perceived appeasement to the foreign powers was a catalyst for the ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' movement and a shift in political power from Edo back to the Imperial Court in [[Kyoto]].

In the second century, it was included in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for \"greater dog\" in contrast to [[Canis Minor]], the \"lesser dog\"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter through the sky. The [[Milky Way]] passes through Canis Major and several [[open cluster]]s lie within its borders, most notably [[Messier 41|M41]].\n\nCanis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the \"dog star\". It is bright because of its proximity to the [[Solar System]]. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high [[luminosity]]. At magnitude 1.5, [[Epsilon Canis Majoris]] (Adhara) is the second-brightest star of the [[constellation]] and the brightest source of [[extreme ultraviolet]] radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]] (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] (Aludra) at 2.4 and [[Omicron1 Canis Majoris|Omicron<sup>1</sup>]] at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary [[Zeta Canis Majoris|Zeta]] (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant [[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], while the [[neutron star]] [[RX J0720.4-3125]] has a radius of a mere 5&nbsp;km.\n\n== History and mythology ==\n\n=== In western astronomy ===\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the [[Babylon]]ians, was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of [[Puppis]] were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the ''[[Babylonian star catalogues#Three Stars Each|Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior [[Ninurta]], and the bow with [[Ishtar]], daughter of [[Enlil]].<ref name=\"rogers1998\">{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

sphere|northern celestial hemisphere]]. In the second century, it was included as an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], or pattern, of two stars in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and it is counted among the [[List of constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for \"lesser dog\", in contrast to [[Canis Major]], the \"greater dog\"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter.\n\nCanis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]], [[Procyon]] (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and [[Gomeisa]] (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by [[Johann Bayer]], who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and [[John Flamsteed]], who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-[[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest]]. A yellow-white [[main sequence]] star, it has a [[white dwarf]] [[Binary star|companion]]. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. [[Luyten's Star]] is a ninth-magnitude [[red dwarf]] and the [[Solar System]]'s next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude [[HD 66141]], which has evolved into an orange [[giant star|giant]] towards the end of its [[stellar evolution|life cycle]], was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint [[deep-sky object]]s within the constellation's borders. The 11 [[Canis-Minorids]] are a [[meteor shower]] that can be seen in early December.\n\n== History and mythology ==\n[[File:Cmi.jpg|thumb|left|Canis Minor, as depicted by [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] in his 1801 work ''Uranographia'']]\nThough strongly associated with the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[celestial cartography|uranographic]] tradition, Canis Minor originates from ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. Procyon and Gomeisa were called ''MASH.TAB.BA'' or \"twins\" in the ''[[Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', this name was also applied to the pairs of [[Pi3 Orionis|Pi<sup>3</sup>]] and [[Pi4 Orionis|Pi<sup>4</sup> Orionis]] and [[Zeta Geminorum|Zeta]] and [[Xi Orionis]]. The meaning of ''MASH.TAB.BA'' evolved as well, becoming the twin deities [[Lulal]] and [[Latarak]], who are on the opposite side of the sky from ''[[Papsukal]]'', the True Shepherd of Heaven in [[Babylonian mythology]]. Canis Minor was also given the name ''DAR.LUGAL'', its position defined as \"the star which stands behind it [Orion]\", in the ''MUL.APIN''; the constellation represents a [[rooster]].

One of the [[88 modern constellations by area|largest constellations]], Centaurus was included among the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In [[Greek mythology]], Centaurus represents a [[centaur]]; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the [[zodiac]]: [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]). Notable stars include [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star system to the [[Solar System]], its neighbour in the sky [[Beta Centauri]], and [[V766 Centauri]], one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains [[Omega Centauri]], the brightest [[globular cluster]] as visible from Earth and one of the largest known.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[Image:Constellation Centaurus.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Centaurus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]\n[[File:Alpha, Beta and Proxima Centauri (1).jpg|right|thumb|280px|The two bright stars are (left) [[Alpha Centauri]] and (right) [[Beta Centauri]].

Its alpha and beta stars are used as \"pointer stars\" to help observers find the constellation [[Crux]]. Centaurus has 281 stars above magnitude 6.5, meaning that they are visible to the unaided eye, the most of any constellation. [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star system to the Sun, has a high [[proper motion]]; it will be a mere half-degree from [[Beta Centauri]] in approximately 4000 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\n[[Alpha Centauri]] is a [[triple star system]] that contains [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star to the Sun. Traditionally called Rigil Kentaurus or Toliman, meaning \"foot of the centaur\", the system has an overall magnitude of -0.28 and is 4.4 [[light-year]]s from Earth. The primary and secondary are both yellow-hued stars; the primary, is of magnitude -0.01 and the secondary is of magnitude 1.35. Proxima, the tertiary star, is a [[red dwarf]] of magnitude 11.0; it is almost 2 degrees away from the primary and secondary and has a period of approximately one million years. Also a [[flare star]], Proxima has minutes-long outbursts where it brightens by over a magnitude. The primary and secondary have a period of 80 years and will be closest to each other as seen from Earth in 2037 and 2038.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nIn addition to Alpha Centauri (the [[list of brightest stars|third-brightest star]] in the sky), a second [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] star, [[Beta Centauri]], is part of Centaurus. Also called Hadar and Agena, Beta Centauri is a double star; the primary is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 0.6, 525 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 4.0 and has a very small separation. A bright [[binary star]] in Centaurus is [[Gamma Centauri]], which appears to the naked eye at magnitude 2.2. The primary and secondary are both blue-white hued stars of magnitude 2.9; their period is 84 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nCentaurus also has many dimmer double stars and binary stars. [[3 Centauri]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 4.5 and a secondary of magnitude 6.0. The primary is 344 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nCentaurus is home to many [[variable stars]]. [[R Centauri]] is a [[Mira variable]] star with a minimum magnitude of 11.8 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3; it is about 1,250 light-years from Earth and has a period of 18 months.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}} [[V810 Centauri]] is a [[semiregular variable]].\n\n[[BPM 37093]] is a [[white dwarf]] star whose [[carbon]] atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since [[diamond]] also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star \"Lucy\" after the Beatles song \"''[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.asp?newsID=993|title=Discovery of largest known diamond|date=February 15, 2004|work=AZoM|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref>\n\n[[PDS 70]], ('''V1032 Centauri''') a low mass T Tauri star is found in the constellation Centauras.In July 2018,PDS70 had the first confirmed image of  a [[Protoplanetary disc]] containing a nascent [[exoplanet]], named [[PDS 70b]].<ref name=\"EA-20180702\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=First confirmed image of newborn planet caught with ESO's VLT - Spectrum reveals cloudy atmosphere |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/e-fci062918.php |date=2 July 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"ESO-20180629\">{{cite web |author=M\u00fcller, a. et al. |title=Orbital and atmospheric characterization of the planet within the gap of the PDS 70 transition disk |url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1821/eso1821b.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=[[ESO]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"ESO-20180630\">{{cite web |author=Keppler, M. et al. |title=Discovery of a planetary-mass companion within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 |url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1821/eso1821a.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=[[ESO]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\n[[Omega Centauri|\u03c9 Centauri]] (NGC 5139), despite being listed as the constellation's \"omega\" star, is in fact a naked-eye [[globular cluster]], located at a distance of 17,000 light-years with a diameter of 150 light-years. It is the largest and brightest globular cluster in the [[Milky Way]]; at ten times the size of the next-largest cluster,<ref name=\"objects\"/> it has a magnitude of 3.7. It is also the most [[luminosity|luminous]] globular cluster in the Milky Way, at over one million [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}  Omega Centauri is classified as a Shapley class VIII cluster, which means that its center is loosely concentrated. It is also the only globular cluster to be designated with a [[Bayer letter]]; the globular cluster [[47 Tucanae]] is the only one designated with a [[Flamsteed number]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=161}} It contains several million stars, most of which are [[yellow dwarf]] stars, but also possesses [[red giant]]s and [[B-type star|blue-white]] stars; the stars have an average age of 12 billion years. This has prompted suspicion that Omega Centauri was the [[Galactic Center|core]] of a [[dwarf galaxy]] that had been [[galactic merger|absorbed]] by the Milky Way. Omega Centauri was determined to be nonstellar in 1677 by the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]],<ref name=\"objects\"/> though it was visible as a star to the ancients. Its status as a globular cluster was determined by [[James Dunlop]] in 1827.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=163}} To the unaided eye, Omega Centauri appears fuzzy and is obviously non-circular; it is approximately half a degree in diameter, the same size as the full Moon.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nCentaurus is also home to open clusters. [[NGC 3766]] is an open cluster 6,300 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye. It contains approximately 100 stars, the brightest of which are 7th magnitude. [[NGC 5460]] is another naked-eye open cluster, 2,300 light-years from Earth, that has an overall magnitude of 6 and contains approximately 40 stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nThere is one bright [[planetary nebula]] in Centaurus, [[NGC 3918]], also known as the Blue Planetary. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and a central star of magnitude 11.0; it is 2600 light-years from Earth. The Blue Planetary was discovered by [[John Herschel]] and named for its color's similarity to [[Uranus]], though the nebula is apparently three times larger than the planet.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\nCentaurus is rich in galaxies as well. [[NGC 4622]] is a face-on [[spiral galaxy]] located 200 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0146). Its [[spiral arms]] wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a [[galaxy merger|collision]] with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure.<ref name=\"objects\"/> [[NGC 5253]], a peculiar [[irregular galaxy]], is located near the border with Hydra and [[Messier 83|M83]], with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1-2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxy's high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}} NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as [[binoculars]] under good conditions; it has been described as \"shaped like a candle flame\", being long and thin (16' by 3'). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is [[NGC 5102]], found by star-hopping from [[Iota Centauri]]. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}}\n\nOne of the closest [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] to Earth is the [[Centaurus A]] galaxy, NGC 5128, at a distance of 11 million light-years (redshift 0.00183). It has a [[supermassive black hole]] at its core, which expels massive jets of matter that emit [[radio wave]]s due to [[synchrotron radiation]]. Astronomers posit that its dust lanes, not common in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], are due to a previous [[galaxy merger|merger]] with another galaxy,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}} probably a [[spiral galaxy]]. NGC 5128 appears in the [[optical spectrum]] as a fairly large elliptical galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]]. Its overall magnitude is 7.0 and it has been seen under perfect conditions with the naked eye, making it one of the most distant objects visible to the unaided observer. In equatorial and southern latitudes, it is easily found by [[star hopping]] from Omega Centauri. In small telescopes, the dust lane is not visible; it begins to appear with about 4 inches of aperture under good conditions. In large amateur instruments, above about 12 inches in aperture, the dust lane's west-northwest to east-southeast direction is easily discerned. Another dim dust lane on the east side of the 12-arcminute-by-15-arcminute galaxy is also visible.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}}  [[ESO 270-17]], also called the Fourcade-Figueroa Object, is a low-surface brightness object believed to be the remnants of a galaxy; it does not have a core and is very difficult to observe with an amateur telescope. It measures 7 arcminutes by 1 arcminute.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}} It likely originated as a spiral galaxy and underwent a catastrophic gravitational interaction with Centaurus A around 500 million years ago, stopping its rotation and destroying its structure.{{sfn|Steinicke|2007|p=182}}\n\n[[NGC 4650A]] is a [[polar-ring galaxy]] located at a distance of 136 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.01). It has a central core made of older stars that resembles an [[elliptical galaxy]], and an outer ring of young stars that orbits around the core. The plane of the outer ring is distorted, which suggests that NGC 4650A is the result of a [[galaxy collision]] about a billion years ago. This galaxy has also been cited in studies of [[dark matter]], because the stars in the outer ring orbit too quickly for their collective mass. This suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a [[dark matter halo]], which provides the necessary mass.<ref name=\"objects\">{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}</ref>\n\nOne of the closest [[galaxy cluster]]s to Earth is the [[Centaurus Cluster]], located at a distance of 160 million light-years ([[redshift]] 0.0114). It has a cooler, denser central region of gas and a hotter, more diffuse outer region. The [[intracluster medium]] in the Centaurus Cluster has a high concentration of metals (elements heavier than helium) due to a large number of [[supernova]]e. This cluster also possesses a plume of gas whose origin is unknown.<ref name=\"objects\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kentauren, 1602 - Skoklosters slott - 102438.tif|thumb|Centaurus, 1602]]\nWhile Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. [[Precession (astronomy)|Precession]] has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern [[declination]]. Thousands of years from now Centaurus will, once again, be at lower latitudes and be visible worldwide.\n\nThe figure of Centaurus can be traced back to a Babylonian constellation known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was depicted in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the rear legs and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.<ref>''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 57ff</ref>\n\nThe Greeks depicted the constellation as a [[centaur]] and gave it its current name. It was mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in the 4th century BC and [[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BC. In the 2nd century AD, [[Claudius Ptolemy]] catalogued 37 stars in Centaurus, including Alpha Centauri. Large as it is now, in earlier times it was even larger, as the constellation [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]] was treated as an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within Centaurus, portrayed in illustrations as an unspecified animal either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear.<ref name=Allen>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Richard Hinckley|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|date=1963|publisher=Dover|isbn=0-486-21079-0|page=279}}</ref> The [[Crux|Southern Cross]], which is now regarded as a separate constellation, was treated by the ancients as a mere asterism formed of the stars composing the centaur's legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] was treated as undefined stars under the centaur's front hooves.\n\nAccording to the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (''Fasti'' v.379), the constellation honors the centaur [[Chiron]], who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including [[Heracles]] (Hercules), [[Theseus]], and [[Jason]], the leader of the Argonauts. It is not to be confused with the more warlike centaur represented by the zodiacal constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The legend associated with Chiron says that he was accidentally poisoned with an arrow shot by Hercules, and was subsequently placed in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}\n\n==Equivalents==\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Centaurus are found in three areas: the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (\u6771\u65b9\u9752\u9f8d, ''D\u014dng F\u0101ng Q\u012bng L\u00f3ng''), the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (\u5357\u65b9\u6731\u96c0, ''N\u00e1n F\u0101ng Zh\u016b Qu\u00e8''), and the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (\u8fd1\u5357\u6975\u661f\u5340, ''J\u00ecnn\u00e1nj\u00edx\u012bng\u014du''). Not all of the stars of Centaurus can be seen from China, and the unseen stars were classified among the Southern Asterisms by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on his study of western star charts. However, most of the brightest stars of Centaurus, including [[Alpha Centauri|\u03b1 Centauri]], [[Theta Centauri|\u03b8 Centauri]] (or Menkent<ref name=\"IAU-LSN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>), [[Epsilon Centauri|\u03b5 Centauri]] and [[Eta Centauri|\u03b7 Centauri]], can be seen in the Chinese sky.\n\nSome [[Polynesian people]]s considered the stars of Centaurus to be a constellation as well. On [[Pukapuka]], Centaurus had two names: ''Na Mata-o-te-tokolua'' and ''Na Lua-mata-o-Wua-ma-Velo''. In [[Tonga]], the constellation was called by four names: ''O-nga-tangata'', ''Tautanga-ufi'', ''Mamangi-Halahu'', and ''Mau-kuo-mau''. Alpha and Beta Centauri were not named specifically by the people of Pukapuka or Tonga, but they were named by the people of [[Hawaii]] and the [[Tuamotus]]. In Hawaii, the name for Alpha Centauri was either ''Melemele'' or ''Ka Maile-hope'' and the name for Beta Centauri was either ''Polapola'' or ''Ka Maile-mua''. In the Tuamotu islands, Alpha was called ''Na Kuhi'' and Beta was called ''Tere''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}\n\n== Namesakes ==\nTwo [[United States Navy]] ships, [[USS Centaurus (AKA-17)]] and [[USS Centaurus (AK-264)]], were named after Centaurus, the constellation.\n\n[[The Centaurus]] is also a name of a [[Mega Mall]] and commercial / residential complex in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]]. Construction started in 2005 and the three 41 high storey towers, the tallest structures today in Islamabad, were completed by late 2012. The shopping mall was officially opened on February 17, 2013. The Centaurus originally included a [[Hotel rating#More than five stars|7 star hotel]], construction of which is yet to begin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centaurus (Chinese astronomy)]]\n*[[List of brightest stars]]\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n;References\n* [http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Centaurus.html Centaurus, by Chris Dolan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070329110850/http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/centaurus.html C.S.

On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes, such as [[Earth]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[io (moon)|Io]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], visible impact craters are less common because they become [[erosion|eroded]], buried or transformed by [[tectonics]] over time. Where such processes have destroyed most of the original crater topography, the terms [[impact structure]] or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms [[cryptoexplosion]] or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.<ref>French, B.M.

Bucher]] studied a number of sites now recognized as impact craters in the United States. He concluded they had been created by some great explosive event, but believed that this force was probably [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin. However, in 1936, the geologists [[John D. Boon (geologist)|John D. Boon]] and [[Claude C. Albritton Jr.]] revisited Bucher's studies and concluded that the craters that he studied were probably formed by impacts.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boon|first1=John D.|last2=Albritton|first2=Claude C.

Ralph Baldwin in 1949 wrote that the Moon's craters were mostly of impact origin.  Around 1960, [[Gene Shoemaker]] revived the idea.  According to [[David H. Levy]], Gene \"saw the craters on the Moon as logical impact sites that were formed not gradually, in [[geologic time scale|eons]], but explosively, in seconds.\"  For his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (1960), under the guidance of [[Harry Hammond Hess]], Shoemaker studied the impact dynamics of [[Meteor Crater|Barringer Meteor Crater]].  Shoemaker noted Meteor Crater had the same form and structure as two [[explosion crater]]s created from [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] tests at the [[Nevada Test Site]], notably [[Operation Buster-Jangle|Jangle U]] in 1951 and [[Operation Teapot|Teapot Ess]] in 1955. In 1960, [[Edward C. T. Chao]] and Shoemaker identified ([[coesite]]) at Meteor Crater, proving the crater was formed from an impact generating extremely high temperatures and pressures.  They followed this discovery with the identification of coesite within [[suevite]] at [[N\u00f6rdlinger_Ries]], proving its impact origin.<ref name=\"Levy\">{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=David |title=Shoemaker by Levy: The man who made an impact |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691113258 |pages=59,69,74-75,78-79,81-85,99-100}}</ref>\n\nArmed with the knowledge of shock-metamorphic features, [[Carlyle S. Beals]] and colleagues at the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada and [[Wolf von Engelhardt]] of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in Germany began a methodical search for impact craters. By 1970, they had tentatively identified more than 50. Although their work was controversial, the American [[Apollo program|Apollo]] Moon landings, which were in progress at the time, provided supportive evidence by recognizing the rate of impact cratering on the [[Moon]].<ref>Grieve, R.A.F. (1990) Impact Cratering on the Earth. ''Scientific American,'' April 1990, p. 66.</ref> Because the processes of erosion on the Moon are minimal, craters persist almost indefinitely. Since the Earth could be expected to have roughly the same cratering rate as the Moon, it became clear that the Earth had suffered far more impacts than could be seen by counting evident craters.\n\n==Crater formation==\n[[File:Impact movie.ogg|thumb|A laboratory simulation of an impact event and crater formation]]\n\nImpact cratering involves high velocity collisions between solid objects, typically much greater than the [[speed of sound|velocity of sound]] in those objects.  Such hyper-velocity impacts produce physical effects such as [[melting]] and [[Evaporation|vaporization]] that do not occur in familiar sub-sonic collisions.  On Earth, ignoring the slowing effects of travel through the atmosphere, the lowest impact velocity with an object from space is equal to the gravitational [[escape velocity]] of about 11&nbsp;km/s. The fastest impacts occur at about 72&nbsp;km/s<ref name=\"ams-fireball-faq\" /> in the \"worst case\" scenario in which an object in a retrograde near-parabolic orbit hits Earth. (Because kinetic energy scales as velocity squared, Earth's gravity only contributes 1&nbsp;km/s to this figure, not 11&nbsp;km/s). The [[median]] impact velocity on Earth is about 20&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kenkmann |first1=Thomas |last2=H\u00f6rz |first2=Friedrich |last3=Deutsch |first3=Alexander |title=Large Meteorite Impacts III |issue=384 |publisher=Geological Society of America |page=34 |isbn=0-8137-2384-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMwt9iaYA9gC&pg=PA34|date=2005-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the slowing effects of travel through the atmosphere rapidly decelerate any potential impactor, especially in the lowest 12 kilometres where 90% of the earth\u2019s atmospheric mass lies. Meteorites of up to 7,000&nbsp;kg lose all their cosmic velocity due to atmospheric drag at a certain altitude (retardation point), and start to accelerate again due to Earth's gravity until the body reaches its [[terminal velocity]] of  0.09 to 0.16&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"ams-fireball-faq\" /> The larger the meteoroid (i.e. asteroids and comets) the more of its initial cosmic velocity it preserves. While an object of 9,000&nbsp;kg maintains about 6% of its original velocity, one of 900,000&nbsp;kg already preserves about 70%. Extremely large bodies (about 100,000 tonnes) are not slowed by the atmosphere at all, and impact with their initial cosmic velocity if no prior disintegration occurs.<ref name=\"ams-fireball-faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/#12 |title=How fast are meteorites traveling when they reach the ground |work=American Meteor Society |accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nImpacts at these high speeds produce [[shock wave]]s in solid materials, and both impactor and the material impacted are rapidly [[compression (physical)|compressed]] to high density. Following initial compression, the high-density, over-compressed region rapidly depressurizes, exploding violently, to set in train the sequence of events that produces the impact crater. Impact-crater formation is therefore more closely analogous to cratering by [[explosive material|high explosives]] than by mechanical displacement. Indeed, the [[energy density]] of some material involved in the formation of impact craters is many times higher than that generated by high explosives. Since craters are caused by [[explosion]]s, they are nearly always circular \u2013 only very low-angle impacts cause significantly elliptical craters.<ref name=\"Melosh89\">Melosh, H.J., 1989, Impact cratering: A geologic process: New York, Oxford University Press, 245 p.</ref>\n\nThis describes impacts on solid surfaces. Impacts on porous surfaces, such as that of [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]], may produce internal compression without ejecta, punching a hole in the surface without filling in nearby craters. This may explain the 'sponge-like' appearance of that moon.<ref>[http://www.space.com/4028-key-giant-space-sponge-revealed.html 'Key to Giant Space Sponge Revealed'], ''Space.com'', 4 July 2007</ref>\n\nIt is convenient to divide the impact process conceptually into three distinct stages: (1) initial contact and compression, (2) excavation, (3) modification and collapse.  In practice, there is overlap between the three processes with, for example, the excavation of the crater continuing in some regions while modification and collapse is already underway in others.\n\n===Contact and compression===\n[[File:Nested Craters on Mars.jpg|thumb|Nested Craters on Mars,  40.104\u00b0 N, 125.005\u00b0 E. These nested craters are probably caused by changes in the strength of the target material. This usually happens when a weaker material overlies a stronger material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_027610_2205|title=HiRISE - Nested Craters (ESP_027610_2205)|website=HiRISE Operations Center |publisher=[[University of Arizona]]}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the absence of [[atmosphere]], the impact process begins when the impactor first touches the target surface. This contact [[acceleration|accelerates]] the target and decelerates the impactor.  Because the impactor is moving so rapidly, the rear of the object moves a significant distance during the short-but-finite time taken for the deceleration to propagate across the impactor. As a result, the impactor is compressed, its density rises, and the [[pressure]] within it increases dramatically.  Peak pressures in large impacts exceed 1 [[Tera-|T]][[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] to reach values more usually found deep in the interiors of planets, or generated artificially in [[nuclear explosions]].\n\nIn physical terms, a shock wave originates from the point of contact.  As this shock wave expands, it decelerates and compresses the impactor, and it accelerates and compresses the target. Stress levels within the shock wave far exceed the strength of solid materials; consequently, both the impactor and the target close to the impact site are irreversibly damaged.  Many crystalline minerals can be transformed into higher-density phases by shock waves; for example, the common mineral quartz can be transformed into the higher-pressure forms [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]].  Many other shock-related changes take place within both impactor and target as the shock wave passes through, and some of these changes can be used as diagnostic tools to determine whether particular geological features were produced by impact cratering.<ref name=\"Melosh89\" />\n\nAs the shock wave decays, the shocked region decompresses towards more usual pressures and densities. The damage produced by the shock wave raises the temperature of the material. In all but the smallest impacts this increase in temperature is sufficient to melt the impactor, and in larger impacts to vaporize most of it and to melt large volumes of the target. As well as being heated, the target near the impact is accelerated by the shock wave, and it continues moving away from the impact behind the decaying shock wave.<ref name=\"Melosh89\" />\n\n===Excavation===\nContact, compression, decompression, and the passage of the shock wave all occur within a few tenths of a second for a large impact. The subsequent excavation of the crater occurs more slowly, and during this stage the flow of material is largely subsonic. During excavation, the crater grows as the accelerated target material moves away from the point of impact. The target's motion is initially downwards and outwards, but it becomes outwards and upwards. The flow initially produces an approximately hemispherical cavity that continues to grow, eventually producing a [[paraboloid]] (bowl-shaped) crater in which the centre has been pushed down, a significant volume of material has been ejected, and a topographically elevated crater rim has been pushed up.  When this cavity has reached its maximum size, it is called the transient cavity.<ref name=\"Melosh89\" />\n\n[[File:Mimas moon.jpg|thumb|[[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel Crater]] on Saturn's moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]]]]\n\nThe depth of the transient cavity is typically a quarter to a third of its diameter. [[Ejecta]] thrown out of the crater do not include material excavated from the full depth of the transient cavity; typically the depth of maximum excavation is only about a third of the total depth.  As a result, about one third of the volume of the transient crater is formed by the ejection of material, and the remaining two thirds is formed by the displacement of material downwards, outwards and upwards, to form the elevated rim.  For impacts into highly porous materials, a significant crater volume may also be formed by the permanent compaction of the [[pore space]]. Such compaction craters may be important on many asteroids, comets and small moons.\n\nIn large impacts, as well as material displaced and ejected to form the crater, significant volumes of target material may be melted and vaporized together with the original impactor.  Some of this impact melt rock may be ejected, but most of it remains within the transient crater, initially forming a layer of impact melt coating the interior of the transient cavity.  In contrast, the hot dense vaporized material expands rapidly out of the growing cavity, carrying some solid and molten material within it as it does so.  As this hot vapor cloud expands, it rises and cools much like the archetypal mushroom cloud generated by large nuclear explosions.  In large impacts, the expanding vapor cloud may rise to many times the scale height of the atmosphere, effectively expanding into free space.\n\nMost material ejected from the crater is deposited within a few crater radii, but a small fraction may travel large distances at high velocity, and in large impacts it may exceed [[escape velocity]] and leave the impacted planet or moon entirely.  The majority of the fastest material is ejected from close to the center of impact, and the slowest material is ejected close to the rim at low velocities to form an overturned coherent flap of ejecta immediately outside the rim.  As ejecta escapes from the growing crater, it forms an expanding curtain in the shape of an inverted cone. The trajectory of individual particles within the curtain is thought to be largely ballistic.\n\nSmall volumes of un-melted and relatively un-shocked material may be [[spall]]ed at very high relative velocities from the surface of the target and from the rear of the impactor.  Spalling provides a potential mechanism whereby material may be ejected into inter-planetary space largely undamaged, and whereby small volumes of the impactor may be preserved undamaged even in large impacts.  Small volumes of high-speed material may also be generated early in the impact by jetting.  This occurs when two surfaces converge rapidly and obliquely at a small angle, and high-temperature highly shocked material is expelled from the convergence zone with velocities that may be several times larger than the impact velocity.\n\n===Modification and collapse===\n[[File:Conical mound in trough on Mars' north pole.jpg|thumb|Weathering may change the aspect of a crater drastically. This mound on [[Mars]]' north pole may be the result of an impact crater that was buried by [[sediment]] and subsequently re-exposed by [[erosion]].]]\n\nIn most circumstances, the transient cavity is not stable and collapses under gravity.  In small craters, less than about 4&nbsp;km diameter on Earth, there is some limited collapse of the crater rim coupled with debris sliding down the crater walls and drainage of impact melts into the deeper cavity.  The resultant structure is called a simple crater, and it remains bowl-shaped and superficially similar to the transient crater. In simple craters, the original excavation cavity is overlain by a lens of collapse [[breccia]], ejecta and melt rock, and a portion of the central crater floor may sometimes be flat.\n\n[[File:Valhalla crater on Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|Multi-ringed impact basin Valhalla on Jupiter's moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]]]\n\nAbove a certain threshold size, which varies with planetary gravity, the collapse and modification of the transient cavity is much more extensive, and the resulting structure is called a [[complex crater]].  The collapse of the transient cavity is driven by gravity, and involves both the uplift of the central region and the inward collapse of the rim.  The central uplift is not the result of ''elastic rebound'', which is a process in which a material with elastic strength attempts to return to its original geometry; rather the collapse is a process in which a material with little or no strength attempts to return to a state of [[Isostasy|gravitational equilibrium]].\n\nComplex craters have uplifted centers, and they have typically broad flat shallow crater floors, and terraced walls.  At the largest sizes, one or more exterior or interior rings may appear, and the structure may be labeled an ''impact basin'' rather than an impact crater.  Complex-crater morphology on rocky planets appears to follow a regular sequence with increasing size: small complex craters with a central topographic peak are called ''central [[Peak ring (crater)|peak craters]]'', for example [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]]; intermediate-sized craters, in which the central peak is replaced by a ring of peaks, are called ''peak-ring craters'', for example [[schrodinger (crater)|Schr\u00f6dinger]]; and the largest craters contain multiple concentric topographic rings, and are called ''multi-ringed basins'', for example [[mare orientale|Orientale]].  On icy (as opposed to rocky) bodies, other morphological forms appear that may have central pits rather than central peaks, and at the largest sizes may contain many concentric rings. [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla]] on Callisto is an example of this type.\n\n== Identifying impact craters ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}\n[[File:Craterstructure.gif|thumb|[[Impact structure]] of craters: simple and [[complex craters]]]]\n[[File:Wells creek shatter cones 2.JPG|thumb|[[Wells Creek crater]] in Tennessee, United States: a close-up of shatter cones developed in fine grained [[dolomite]]]]\n[[File:USGS Decorah crater.jpg|thumbnail|[[Decorah crater]]: aerial electromagnetic resistivity map ([[U.S. Geological Survey|USGS]])]]\n[[File:Barringer Crater USGS.jpg|thumb|[[Meteor Crater]] in the U.S. state of Arizona, was the world's first confirmed impact crater.]]\n[[File:Shoemaker Impact Structure, Western Australia.JPG|thumb|[[Shoemaker Crater]] in Western Australia was renamed in memory of Gene Shoemaker.]]\n\nNon-explosive volcanic craters can usually be distinguished from impact craters by their irregular shape and the association of volcanic flows and other volcanic materials. Impact craters produce melted rocks as well, but usually in smaller volumes with different characteristics.\n\nThe distinctive mark of an impact crater is the presence of rock that has undergone shock-metamorphic effects, such as [[shatter cone]]s, melted rocks, and crystal deformations. The problem is that these materials tend to be deeply buried, at least for simple craters. They tend to be revealed in the uplifted center of a complex crater, however.\n\nImpacts produce distinctive [[Shock metamorphism|shock-metamorphic]] effects that allow impact sites to be distinctively identified. Such shock-metamorphic effects can include:\n* A layer of shattered or \"[[breccia]]ted\" rock under the floor of the crater. This layer is called a \"breccia lens\".{{sfn |Randall |2015 |p=157}}\n* [[Shatter cone]]s, which are chevron-shaped impressions in rocks.{{sfn |Randall |2015 |pp=154\u2013155}} Such cones are formed most easily in fine-grained rocks.\n* High-temperature rock types, including laminated and welded blocks of sand, [[spherulite]]s and [[tektite]]s, or glassy spatters of molten rock. The impact origin of tektites has been questioned by some researchers; they have observed some volcanic features in tektites not found in impactites. Tektites are also drier (contain less water) than typical impactites. While rocks melted by the impact resemble volcanic rocks, they incorporate unmelted fragments of bedrock, form unusually large and unbroken fields, and have a much more mixed chemical composition than volcanic materials spewed up from within the Earth. They also may have relatively large amounts of trace elements that are associated with meteorites, such as nickel, platinum, iridium, and cobalt. Note: scientific literature has reported that some \"shock\" features, such as small shatter cones, which are often associated only with impact events, have been found also in terrestrial volcanic ejecta.{{sfn |Randall |2015 |p=156}}\n* Microscopic pressure deformations of minerals.{{sfn |Randall |2015 |p=155}} These include fracture patterns in crystals of quartz and feldspar, and formation of high-pressure materials such as diamond, derived from graphite and other carbon compounds, or [[stishovite]] and [[coesite]], varieties of [[shocked quartz]].\n* Buried craters, such as the [[Decorah crater]], can be identified through drill coring, aerial electromagnetic resistivity imaging, and airborne gravity gradiometry.<ref>{{cite web |author=US Geological Survey |title=Iowa Meteorite Crater Confirmed |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=3521 |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Economic importance of impacts==\n\nOn Earth impact craters have resulted in useful minerals.   Some of the ores produced from impact related effects on Earth include ores of [[iron]], [[uranium]], [[gold]], [[copper]], and [[nickel]].  It is estimated that the value of materials mined from impact structures is 5 billion dollars/year just for North America.<ref name=\"Grieve, R. 1994\">Grieve, R., V. Masaitis.  1994.  The Economic Potential of Terrestrial Impact Craters.  International Geology Review:  36, 105-151.</ref>   \nThe eventual usefulness of impact craters depends on several factors especially the nature of the materials that were impacted and when the materials were affected.  In some cases the deposits were already in place and the impact brought them to the surface.  These are called \u201cprogenetic economic deposits.\u201d  Others were created during the actual impact.  The great energy involved caused melting.  Useful minerals formed as a result of this energy are classified as \u201csyngenetic deposits.\u201d  The third type, called \u201cepigenetic deposits,\u201d is caused by the creation of a basin from the impact.\nMany of the minerals that our modern lives depend on are associated with impacts in the past.

It is one of the 48&nbsp;constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its brightest [[star]]s form a semicircular arc. Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means \"northern crown\".  In [[classical mythology]] Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god [[Dionysus]] to the Cretan princess [[Ariadne]] and set by him in the heavens. Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders, an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or even a smokehole. Ptolemy also listed a southern counterpart, [[Corona Australis]], with a similar pattern.\n\nThe brightest star is the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&nbsp;2.2 [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]]. The yellow supergiant [[R Coronae Borealis]] is the prototype of a rare class of giant stars\u2014the [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s\u2014that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs. [[T Coronae Borealis]], also known as the Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a [[recurrent nova]].

The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, and it features a prominent [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as the [[Northern Cross (asterism)|Northern Cross]] (in contrast to the [[Southern Cross]]). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.\n\nCygnus contains [[Deneb]], one of the [[brightest stars]] in the night sky and one corner of the [[Summer Triangle]], as well as some notable X-ray sources and the giant [[stellar association]] of [[Cygnus OB2]]. Cygnus is also known as the Northern Cross.  Deneb is the tail star in the constellation and is the Arabic word for tail. One of the stars of this association, [[NML Cygni]], is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars currently known]]. The constellation is also home to [[Cygnus X-1]], a distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a [[black hole]]. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the [[Kepler Mission]] observing one patch of the sky, an area around Cygnus. In addition, most of the eastern part of Cygnus is dominated by the [[Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall]], a giant [[galaxy filament]] that is the largest known structure in the observable universe, covering most of the northern sky.\n\n== History and mythology ==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cygnus as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Surrounding it are Lacerta, Vulpecula and Lyra.]]\n\n=== In western-classic astronomy ===\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans. [[Zeus]] disguised himself as a swan to seduce [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], [[Sparta]]n king [[Tyndareus]]'s wife, who gave birth to the [[Castor and Pollux|Gemini]], [[Helen of Troy]], and [[Clytemnestra]];{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=134\u2013137}} [[Orpheus]] was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his [[lyre]] ([[Lyra]]); and the King [[Cycnus|Cygnus]] was transformed into a swan.\n\nThe Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of [[Phaethon]], the son of [[Helios]] the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day.  Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].  According to the myth, Phaethon's brother, Cycnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial.  The gods were so touched by Cycnus's devotion to his brother that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.<ref>P.K. Chen (2007)'' A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky'', p. 70 ({{ISBN|978-1-931559-38-6}}).</ref>\n\nIn [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', there are three people named Cygnus, all of whom are transformed into swans. Alongside Cycnus, noted above, he mentions a boy from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] who commits suicide when [[Phyllius]] refuses to give him a tamed bull that he demands, but is transformed into a swan and flies away. He also mentions a son of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] who is an invulnerable warrior in the [[Trojan War]] who is eventually defeated by [[Achilles]], but Neptune saves him by transforming him into a swan.\n\nTogether with other [[bird|avian]] constellations near the [[summer solstice]], [[Lyra#History|Vultur cadens]] and [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], Cygnus may be a significant part of the origin of the myth of the [[Stymphalian Birds]], one of [[The Twelve Labours]] of [[Hercules]].<ref>Allen (1963) p. 56.</ref>\n\n=== In non-western astronomy ===\n{{See also|Cygnus in Chinese astronomy}}\nIn [[Hinduism]], the period of time or the [[Muhurta]] which lasts from 4:24 AM to 5:12 AM is called the \"Brahma Muhurta\" translating to \"The moment of the Universe\" and the Star system in correlation is the Cygnus constellation. This is a highly auspicious time to do any task or start the day.\n \nIn [[Polynesia]], Cygnus was often recognized as a separate constellation. In [[Tonga]] it was called ''Tuula-lupe'', and in the [[Tuamotus]] it was called ''Fanui-tai''. Deneb was also often given a name. The name ''Deneb'' comes from the [[Arabic]] name ''dhaneb'', meaning \"tail\", from the phrase ''Dhanab ad-Daj\u0101jah'', which means \u201cthe tail of the hen\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/cygnus-constellation/ |title=Cygnus Constellation: Facts, Myth, Star Map, Major Stars, Deep Sky Objects - Constellation Guide |website=constellation-guide.com}}</ref> In [[New Zealand]] it was called ''Mara-tea'', in the [[Society Islands]] it was called ''Pirae-tea'' or ''Taurua-i-te-haapa-raa-manu'', and in the Tuamotus it was called ''Fanui-raro''.

The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent the bottom of the toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula.

Collinder 421 is a particularly old open cluster at an age of approximately 1 billion years; it is of magnitude 10.1. 3100 light-years from Earth, more than 30 stars are visible in a diameter of 8 arcseconds. The prominent star in the north of the cluster has a golden color, whereas the stars in the south of the cluster appear orange. Collinder 421 appears to be embedded in nebulosity, which extends past the cluster's borders to its west. Berkeley 90 is a smaller open cluster, with a diameter of 5 arcminutes.

The \"[[Soap bubble nebula]]\" (PN G75.5+1.7), near the Crescent nebula, was discovered on a digital image by Dave Jurasevich in 2007.  In 2011, Austrian amateur Matthias Kronberger discovered a planetary nebula ([[Kronberger 61]], now nicknamed \"The Soccer Ball\") on old survey photos, confirmed recently in images by the Gemini Observatory; both of these are likely too faint to be detected by eye in a small amateur scope.\n\nBut a much more obscure and relatively 'tiny' object\u2014one which is readily seen in dark skies by amateur telescopes, under good conditions\u2014is the newly discovered nebula (likely reflection type) associated with the star 4 Cygni (HD 183056): an approximately fan-shaped glowing region of several arcminutes' diameter, to the south and west of the fifth-magnitude star.  It was first discovered visually near San Jose, California and publicly reported by amateur astronomer Stephen Waldee in 2007, and was confirmed photographically by Al Howard in 2010.  California amateur astronomer Dana Patchick also says he detected it on the Palomar Observatory survey photos in 2005 but had not published it for others to confirm and analyze at the time of Waldee's first official notices and later 2010 paper.\n\n[[Cygnus-X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] is the largest star-forming region in the Solar neighborhood and includes not only some of the [[Most luminous stars|brightest]] and [[List of most massive stars|most massive]] stars known (such as [[Cygnus OB2-12]]), but also [[Cygnus OB2]], a massive [[stellar association]] classified by some authors as a young [[globular cluster]].\n\nMore [[supernova]]e have been seen in the [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) than in any other [[galaxy]].\n\n[[Cygnus A]] is the first [[radio galaxy]] discovered; at a distance of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy. In the [[visible spectrum]], it appears as an [[elliptical galaxy]] in a small [[galaxy cluster|cluster]]. It is classified as an [[active galaxy]] because the [[supermassive black hole]] at its [[active galactic nucleus|nucleus]] is accreting matter, which produces two [[astrophysical jet|jets]] of matter from the poles.

Various [[#Definitions|definitions]] exist but fall into two broad categories. The first, the '''small calorie''', or '''gram calorie''' (symbol: '''cal'''), is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one [[gram]] of water by one degree [[Celsius]] at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref name=\"Webster\" /> The second, the '''large calorie''' or '''kilogram calorie''' (symbols: '''Cal''', '''kcal'''), also known as the '''food calorie''' and similar names,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> is defined as the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram (rather than a gram) of water by one degree Celsius. It is equal to {{val|1000|fmt=commas}} small calories.<ref name=Webster/>\n\nAlthough these units relate to the [[metric system]], all of them have been considered obsolete in science since the adoption of the SI system.<ref name=Hist/> The unit of energy in the [[International System of Units]] is the [[joule]]. One small calorie is approximately<!--4.2 not 4.186 see below --> 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 [[Joule#Kilojoule|kilojoules]]). The factor used to [[Conversion of units of energy|convert]] calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the [[specific heat capacity]] of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram (or per kilogram, for kilocalories). The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.\n\nIn spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of [[food energy]]. The small calorie is also often used for measurements in [[chemistry]], although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.\n\n==History==\nThe (large) calorie was first defined by [[Nicolas Cl\u00e9ment]] in 1824 as a unit of [[heat]] energy.<ref name=Hist/> It entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes {{ety|la|calor|heat}}. The small calorie was introduced by P. A. Favre and J. T. Silbermann in 1852. In 1879, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] introduced the convention of capitalizing the large Calorie to distinguish the senses. The use of the (large) calorie for nutrition was introduced to the American public by [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], a professor at [[Wesleyan University]], in 1887.<ref name=Hist/>\n\n==Definitions==\nThe energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1&nbsp;\u00b0C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.\n\nThe pressure is usually taken to be the [[standard atmospheric pressure]] ({{val|101.325|u=kPa}}). The temperature increase can be expressed as one [[kelvin]], which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Name !! Symbol !! Conversions !!

For example, the energy released in a [[chemical reaction]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of reagent is occasionally expressed in [[kilocalorie per mole|kilocalories per mole]].<ref name=Zvi/> Typically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in [[aqueous solution]]: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1&nbsp;kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as [[bond energy|enthalpy of formation]] and the size of [[activation energy|activation barrier]]s.<ref name=\"Bhagavan\">{{cite book|last1=Bhagavan|first1=N.

Its Latin name means \"southern crown\", and it is the southern counterpart of [[Corona Borealis]], the northern crown. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] or [[Centaurus]]. Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a [[rock hyrax]].\n\nAlthough fainter than its northern counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. [[Alpha Coronae Australis|Alpha]] and [[Beta Coronae Australis]] are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. [[Epsilon Coronae Australis]] is the brightest example of a [[W Ursae Majoris variable]] in the southern sky. Lying alongside the [[Milky Way]], Corona Australis contains one of the closest [[Star formation|star-forming regions]] to the [[Solar System]]\u2014a dusty [[dark nebula]] known as the [[Corona Australis Molecular Cloud]], lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars [[R Coronae Australis|R]] and [[TY Coronae Australis]] light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe name of the constellation was entered as \"Corona Australis\" when the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) established the 88 modern constellations in 1922.<ref name=\"IAUTransactions3\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm |title=Proceedings of the 1st General Assembly |date=1922 |conference=Transactions of the International Astronomical Union |location=Rome |volume=1 |pages=158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm |title=IAU constellation list 1 |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |accessdate=2017-01-06 }}</ref>\nIn 1932, the name was instead recorded as \"Corona Austrina\" when the IAU's commission on notation approved a list of four-letter abbreviations for the constellations.<ref name=\"IAUTransactions4\">{{cite conference |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transactions-of-the-international-astronomical-union/volume/631391278F71D28204CE2F1B0925CD77?pageNum=2 |last1=Schlesinger |first1=F. |last2=Schilt |first2=J. |date=1932 |conference=Transactions of the International Astronomical Union |location=Cambridge |volume=4 |pages=221\u2013222 |title=Meetings of Commissions.

The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CrA'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments (''illustrated in infobox''). In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|17|58.3}} and {{RA|19|19.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between \u221236.77\u00b0 and \u221245.52\u00b0.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Corona Australis}} Covering 128 square degrees, Corona Australis [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around the 30th of June{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} and ranks 80th in area.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Only visible at latitudes south of [[53rd parallel north|53\u00b0 north]],{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Constellations''}} Corona Australis cannot be seen from the British Isles as it lies too far south,{{refn|name=Moore & Tirion 1997 pp164}} but it can be seen from southern Europe{{refn|name=Moore 2005 p202}} and readily from the southern United States.{{refn|name=Moore 'Stargazing' 2000 p86}}\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Constellation Corona Australis.jpg|thumb|left|The constellation Corona Australis as it can be seen by the naked eye]]\nWhile not a bright constellation, Corona Australis is nonetheless distinctive due to its easily identifiable pattern of stars,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=126\u2013127}} which has been described as horseshoe-{{refn|name=Falkner 2011 p100}} or oval-shaped.{{refn|name=Malin Frew 1995 p218}} Though it has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5).{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=130}} [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether.

After Bacchus, Stimula's unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corona Australis are located within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, ''B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}} The constellation itself was known as ''ti'en pieh'' (\"Heavenly Turtle\") and during the [[Western Zhou]] period, marked the beginning of winter. However, [[Axial precession|precession]] over time has meant that the \"Heavenly River\" ([[Milky Way]]) became the more accurate marker to the ancient Chinese and hence supplanted the turtle in this role.{{refn|name=Porter 1996 pp35\u201336}} Arabic names for Corona Australis include ''Al \u0136ubbah'' \"the Tortoise\", ''Al \u0124ib\u0101'' \"the Tent\" or ''Al Ud\u1e25\u0101 al Na'\u0101m'' \"the Ostrich Nest\".{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172\u2013174}}{{sfn|Motz|Nathanson|1988|p=254}} It was later given the name ''Al Ikl\u012bl al Jan\u016bbiyyah'', which the European authors [[Edmund Chilmead|Chilmead]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]] and Caesius transliterated as Alachil Elgenubi, Elkleil Elgenubi and Aladil Algenubi respectively.{{sfn|Allen|1963|pp=172\u2013174}}\n\nThe [[\u01c0Xam language|\u01c0Xam]] speaking [[San people]] of South Africa knew the constellation as ''\u2260nabbe ta !nu'' \"house of branches\"\u2014owned originally by the Dassie ([[rock hyrax]]), and the star pattern depicting people sitting in a semicircle around a fire.{{sfn|Lloyd|1873}}\n\nThe indigenous [[Wergaia|Boorong]] people of northwestern Victoria saw it as ''Won'', a boomerang thrown by ''Totyarguil'' ([[Altair]]).{{sfn|Hamacher|Frew|2010}} The [[Aranda people]] of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth by a group of sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created [[Gosses Bluff crater]], 175&nbsp;km west of [[Alice Springs]].{{sfn|Hamacher|28 March 2011}} The [[Torres Strait Islanders]] saw Corona Australis as part of a larger constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]'s tail; the [[Pleiades]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the ''Usiam'', and Orion, called the ''Seg''. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a [[Remora|suckerfish]], while [[Eta Sagittarii]] and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=223\u2013224}} On the island of [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]], the figure of Corona Australis was called ''Tanuma'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Na Kaua-ki-Tonga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist\n| colwidth = 20em\n| refs =\n\n{{refn\n| name = Malin Frew 1995 p218\n| {{harvnb|Malin|Frew|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=EQAYGmZT0o8C&pg=PA218 218]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Moore & Tirion 1997 pp164\n| {{harvnb|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Mo6R5OPtlfwC&pg=PA164 164]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Moore 2005 p202\n| {{harvnb|Moore|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=0Pu_YNynaiYC&pg=PA202 202]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Moore 'Stargazing' 2000 p86\n| {{harvnb|Moore, ''Stargazing''|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=y6ureVPI49sC&pg=PA86 86]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Falkner 2011 p100\n| {{harvnb|Falkner|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=tyj8UUE968wC&pg=PA99 100]}} <!-- why does this say p100 and link to p99 ??? -->\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = O'Meara 2002 pp273++\n| {{harvnb|O'Meara|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=3Hg6YHgx9nAC&pg=PA273 164\u2013165, 271\u2013273, 311]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Coe 2007 p105\n| {{harvnb|Coe|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=roXyxpcc9MsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Corona+Australis%22#v=onepage&q=%22Corona%20Australis%22&f=false 105]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Griffiths 2012 p132\n| {{harvnb|Griffiths|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Q2aURFWBI8EC&pg=PA133 132]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = O'Meara 2011 p322\n| {{harvnb|O'Meara|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=v859bKO0A4gC&pg=PA322 322]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Sherrod Koed 2003 p50\n| {{harvnb|Sherrod|Koed|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=4zjv84hHNPcC&pg=PA50 50]}}\n}}\n\n{{refn\n| name = Porter 1996 pp35\u201336\n| {{harvnb|Porter1996|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=qliI0tHxXRYC&pg=PA35 35\u201336]}}\n}}\n\n}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Allen\n  | first = Richard Hinckley\n  | authorlink = Richard Hinckley Allen\n  | date = 1963\n  | origyear = 1899\n  | title = Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning\n  | edition = reprint\n  | publisher = [[Dover Publications]]\n  | location = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|NY]]\n  | isbn = 978-0-486-21079-7\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bagnall\n  | first = Philip M.\n  | date = 2012\n  | title = The Star Atlas Companion : What you need to know about the Constellations\n  | publisher = Springer New York\n  | isbn = 978-1-4614-0830-7\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bakich\n  | first = Michael E.\n  | date = 1995\n  | title = The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-521-44921-2\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bakich\n  | first = Michael E.\n  | date = 2010\n  | title = 1,001 Celestial Wonders to See Before You Die\n  | publisher = Springer Science + Business Media\n  | isbn = 978-1-4419-1777-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Coe\n  | first = Steven R.\n  | date = 2007\n  | title = Nebulae and how to observe them\n  | series = Astronomers' observing guides\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | location = New York, New York\n  | isbn = 978-1-84628-482-3\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal| doi = 10.1086/340368| last1 = Drake| first1 = Jeremy J.| last2 = Marshall| first2 = Herman L.| last3 = Dreizler| first3 = Stefan| last4 = Freeman| first4 = Peter E.| last5 = Fruscione| first5 = Antonella| last6 = Juda| first6 = Michael| last7 = Kashyap| first7 = Vinay| last8 = Nicastro| first8 = Fabrizio| last9 = Pease| first9 = Deron O.| last10 = Wargelin|first10= Bradford J.|last11= Werner|first11= Klaus| date=June 2002 | title = Is RX J1856.5\u22123754 a Quark Star?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 572| issue = 2| pages = 996\u20131001| pmid = | pmc = | arxiv = astro-ph/0204159| bibcode = 2002ApJ...572..996D| ref = {{sfnRef|Drake, Jeremy J. et al.|2002}}\n}}   <!-- {{sfn|Drake, Jeremy J. et al.|2002|p=xxx}} -->\n* {{cite journal| doi = 10.1071/PH560471| last1 = Ellyett| first1 = C.

({{IPA-pt|ko\u0281ko\u02c8vadu}}), meaning \"[[hunchback]]\" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],<ref>[http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/ingles/index.php?lingua=portugues-ingles&palavra=corcovado]</ref> is a mountain in central [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The 710-metre (2,329&nbsp;ft) [[granite]] peak is located in the [[Tijuca Forest]], a national park. It is sometimes confused with nearby [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain]].\n\nCorcovado hill lies just west of the city center but is wholly within the city limits and visible from great distances. It is known worldwide for the 38-metre (125&nbsp;ft) statue of [[Jesus]] atop its peak, entitled [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Cristo Redentor'' or \"Christ the Redeemer\"]].\n\n==Access==\nThe peak and statue can be accessed via a narrow road, by the 3.8 kilometre (2.4&nbsp;mi) [[Corcovado Rack Railway]], which was opened in 1884 and refurbished in 1980, or by the walking trail on the south side of the mountain that starts from Parque Lage. The railway uses three electrically powered trains, with a passenger capacity of 540 passengers per hour.  The rail trip takes approximately 20 minutes and departs every 20 minutes.  Due to its limited passenger capacity, the wait to board at the entry station can take several hours.  The year-round schedule is 8:30 to 18:30.\n\nFrom the train terminus and road, the observation deck at the foot of the statue is reached by 223 steps, or by [[elevator]]s and [[escalator]]s. Among the most popular year-round tourist attractions in Rio, the Corcovado railway, access roads, and statue platform are commonly crowded.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe most popular attraction of Corcovado mountain is the statue and viewing platform at its peak, drawing over 300,000 visitors per year. From the peak's platform the panoramic view includes downtown Rio, [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain]], the [[Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas]] (lake), [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] and [[Ipanema]] beaches, [[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3]] (Maracan\u00e3 Stadium), and several of Rio's [[favela]]s.  Cloud cover is common in Rio and the view from the platform is often obscured.  Sunny days are recommended for optimal viewing.\n\nNotable past visitors to the mountain peak include [[Pope Pius XII]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and [[General Sherman]], among others. An additional attraction of the mountain is [[rock climbing]]. The south face had 54 climbing routes in 1992. The easiest way starts from Park Lage.\n\nThe Corcovado is also a symbol of the Brazilian culture.\n\n==Geology==\nThe peak of Corcovado is a big [[granite dome]], which describes a generally vertical rocky formation. It is claimed to be the highest such formation in Brazil, the second highest being Pedra Agulha, situated near to the town of [[Pancas, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Pancas]] in Esp\u00edrito Santo.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery  widths=\"144px\" heights=\"145px\">\nFile:Pao de acquar rio.jpg|Partial view of Rio de Janeiro from atop Corcovado &mdash; left: [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain (''P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar'')]]; center: [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana beach]]\nImage:Corcovadoporferrez.jpg|thumb|right|Corcovado before the construction of ''Christ the Redeemer'', 19th century\nImage:Trem do Corcovado na Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Paineiras 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Corcovado Rack Railway]]\nImage:Christ on Corcovado mountain.JPG|thumb|right|The statue of ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' atop Corcovado\nFile:Corcovado e Baia de Guanabara.jpg|[[Guanabara Bay]] with Corcovado in the background\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat inline}}\n*[http://rgssamachupicchu.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/lets-go-b-ack-to-rio-dynamic-aspect-of.html 'let's go back to Rio', RGSSA blog post, contains image of Corcovada taken in 1904]\n*[http://www.wikirio.com.br/Morro_do_Corcovado Practical information about Corcovado mountain] on WikiRio\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074054/http://www.riodejaneirophotoguide.com/html/corcovado_main.html Virtual Pictour up the Corcovado Mountain]\n\n[[Category:Mountains of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Granite domes]]\n[[Category:Christ the Redeemer (statue)]]\n[[Category:Geography of Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Rio de Janeiro (state)]]", "sha1": "stuwawzt7g8v8ygulo8ha2h6ytee0x9"}}, {"title": "Cheddar, Somerset", "ns": "0", "id": "6427", "revision": {"id": "861335009", "parentid": "857560176", "timestamp": "2018-09-26T18:04:09Z", "contributor": {"ip": "139.222.38.4"}, "comment": "Fixed typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the village in Somerset|the cheese|Cheddar cheese|other uses|Cheddar (disambiguation){{!}}Cheddar}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{good article}}\n\n{{Infobox UK place\n| static_image_name=Cheddar 09-06 9.jpg\n| static_image_alt=Roofs of multiple buildings separated by trees and vegetation.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, [[Green Book (CD standard)|CD-i]], and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm|in}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm|in}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\" />\n\nFrom the early 2000s CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50% from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\" />  In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

(A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.)\n\n[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Comparison of various optical storage media<!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (\u2300) and wavelength (\u03bb). -->]]\nThe program area is 86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> and the length of the recordable spiral is (86.05&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;\u00b5m)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.38&nbsp;km. With a scanning speed of 1.2&nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&nbsp;MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2 second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] housed within the CD player, through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a [[photodiode]], the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the [[semiconductor laser]] is placed on a mobile laser pickup assembly mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player; this mechanism typically takes the form of a hub that slides across a rail or [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the centre to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do not directly represent the zeros and ones of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing.  The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br /><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Lead-in (CD)|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available, or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]].\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352x240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352x288 is similarly one quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobits]] per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks which can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the colour of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\" /><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\" /> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]).

The write laser in this case is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\" />\n\n==== Speed ====\nDue to technical limitations, the original ReWritable CD could be written no faster than 4x speed. High Speed ReWritable CD has a different design, which permits writing at speeds ranging from 4x to 12x. Original CD-RW drives can only write to original ReWritable CDs. High Speed CD-RW drives can typically write to both original ReWritable CDs and High Speed ReWritable CDs. Both types of CD-RW discs can be read in most CD drives. Higher speed CD-RW discs, Ultra Speed (16x to 24x write speed) and Ultra Speed+ (32x write speed) are now available.\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\" /> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be ripped, or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact Disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[K2 High Definition]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |publisher=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |work=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394021 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516042142/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394021 |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | author =  | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | author =  | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65X2LbVaz?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 18 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | author =  | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | author =  | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

He began his career as a compositor<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/> and occasional contributor to the daily and weekly journals. In 1858, he published in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland, Ohio]]) the first of the \"Artemus Ward\" series, which, in a collected form, achieved great popularity in both America and [[England]]. Brownes' companion at the Plain Dealer George Hoyt wrote \"his desk was a rickety table which had been whittled and gashed until it looked as if it had been the victim of lightning. His chair was a fit companion thereto, a wabbling, unsteady affair, sometimes with four and sometimes with three legs. But Browne saw neither the table, nor the chair, nor any person who might be near, nothing, in fact, but the funny pictures which were tumbling out of his brain. When writing, his gaunt form looked ridiculous enough. One leg hung over the arm of his chair like a great hook, while he would write away, sometimes laughing to himself, and then slapping the table in the excess of his mirth.\"<ref>The Complete Works of Artemus Ward by Melville D. Landon, 1898 page 16</ref>\n\nIn 1860, he became editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'', a humorous New York weekly, which proved a failure. About the same time, he began to appear as a lecturer and, by his droll and eccentric humor, attracted large audiences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Artemus-Ward|title=Artemus Ward {{!}} American humorist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, Browne came as Artemus Ward to [[San Francisco]] to perform. Browne was an expert at publicity and by the time of his arrival, his manager had already been there for weeks advertising with notices in the local papers and talking with prominent citizens for endorsements. On November 13, 1863, he performed to a packed crowd at Platt's Music Hall. Ward played the part of Artemus as an illiterate rube but with \"Yankee common sense.\"<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/> Writer [[Bret Harte|Brett Harte]] was in the audience that night and he described it in ''[[the Golden Era]]'' as capturing American speech, \"humor that belongs to the country of boundless prairies, limitless rivers, and stupendous cataracts--that fun which overlies the surface of our national life, which is met in the stage, [[Railcar|rail-car]], [[canal]] and [[Flatboat|flat-boat]], which bursts out over camp-fires and around bar-room stoves.<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/>\n\n\"Artemus Ward\" was the favorite author of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Before presenting \"[[The Emancipation Proclamation]]\" to his Cabinet,<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/> Lincoln read to them the latest episode, \"Outrage in Utiky\", also known as ''High-Handed Outrage at Utica''.\n\nBrowne was also known as a member of the New York [[Bohemian]] set which included leader [[Henry Clapp Jr.]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]], and actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]].<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/>\n\nWard met [[Mark Twain]] when Ward performed in [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Nevada]] and the two became friends.<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/> In his correspondences with Twain, Browne called him \"My Dearest Love.\" Legend has it that, following Ward's stage performance, he, Mark Twain, and [[Dan De Quille]] were taking a drunken rooftop tour of Virginia City until a town constable threatened to blast all three of them with a [[shotgun]] loaded with [[rock salt]]. Browne recommended Twain to the editors of the New York Press and urged him to journey to New York.<ref name=\"tarnoff\"/>\n\nIn 1866, Ward visited England, where he became exceedingly popular both as a lecturer and as a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. In the spring of the following year, Ward's health gave way and he died of [[tuberculosis]] at Southampton on March 6, 1867.\n\nAfter initially being buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], Ward's remains were removed to the United States on May 20, 1868. He is buried at Elm Vale Cemetery in Waterford, Maine.\n\n==Stories==\n* A Visit to [[Brigham Young]]\n* Women's Rights\n* One of Mr Ward's Business Letters\n* On \"Forts\"\n* Fourth of July Oration\n* High-Handed Outrage at Utica\n* Artemus Ward and the Prince of Wales\n* Interview with Lincoln\n* Letters to his Wife\n\n==Books==\n* Artemus Ward His Book\n* Artemus Ward His Panorama\n* Artemus Ward among the Mormons\n* Artemus Ward in London\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ward, Artemus}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Gutenberg author |id=Ward,+Artemus | name=Artemus Ward}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |name=Artemus Ward}}\n* {{OL author}}\n* {{librivox author | id=1887}}\n* [http://www.mainememory.net/bin/SwishSearch?person=Artemus%20Ward Photos from the Maine Historical Society]\n* 3 short [https://web.archive.org/web/20110120165647/http://californialegacy.org/radio_anthology/scripts/ward.html radio episodes] of Ward's writing from [[California Legacy Project]].\n* Seitz, Don Caros.

It has a [[Single-reed instrument|single-reed]] mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a ''[[clarinetist]]'' (sometimes spelled ''clarinettist'').\n\nWhile the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name,  other factors may have been involved. During the [[Baroque music|Late Baroque era]], composers such as [[Bach]] and [[Handel]] were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, ''clarion'' register. Since the trumpets of this time had no [[Brass instrument valve|valves or pistons]], melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce [[scale (music)|scales]] of adjacent notes as opposed to the gapped scales or [[arpeggios]] of the lower register. The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term ''clarino'' and this in turn came to apply to the musicians themselves. It is probable that the term clarinet may stem from the diminutive version of the 'clarion' or 'clarino' and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly developed \"mock trumpets\".<ref>[[Clarinet#Pino|Pino]], pp. 198 and 233</ref>\n\n[[Johann Christoph Denner]] is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in [[Germany]] around the year 1700 by adding a [[register key]] to the earlier [[chalumeau]]. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.\n\nToday,{{when|date=June 2018}} the most popular clarinet is the B{{music|flat}} clarinet. However, the clarinet in A, just a [[semitone]] lower, is sometimes used in orchestral music, especially older European music. An orchestral clarinetist must have both a B{{music|flat}} and an A instrument available, usually in the same performance. Since the middle of the 19th century the [[bass clarinet]] (nowadays invariably in B{{Music|flat}} but with extra keys to extend the register down a few notes) has become an essential addition to the orchestra. The [[clarinet family]] ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB{{music|flat}} [[subcontrabass clarinet|octo-contrabass]] to the A{{music|flat}} [[piccolo clarinet]]. The clarinet has proved to be an exceptionally flexible instrument, equally at home in the [[classical music|classical]] repertoire as in [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s, [[klezmer]], and [[jazz]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''clarinet'' may have entered the English language via the [[French language|French]] ''clarinette'' (the feminine diminutive of [[Old French]] ''clarin'' or ''clarion''), or from [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] ''[[:oc:Clarin|clarin]]'', \"oboe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/clarinetist|title=clarinetist|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIt would seem however that its real roots are to be found amongst some of the various names for trumpets used around the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] eras. ''Clarion'', ''clarin'' and the Italian ''clarino'' are all derived from the medieval term ''claro'' which referred to an early form of trumpet.<ref>\"The Oxford Companion to Music\" Percy A. Scholes. Tenth Edition. \"Trumpet Family\" 3: p1051</ref> This is probably the origin of the Italian ''clarinetto'', itself a diminutive of ''clarino'', and consequently of the European equivalents such as ''clarinette'' in French or the German ''Klarinette''. According to [[Johann Gottfried Walther]], writing in 1732, the reason for the name is that \"it sounded from far off not unlike a trumpet\". The English form ''clarinet'' is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic ''clarionet'' appears from 1784 until the early years of the 20th century.<ref>[[Clarinet#Rendall|Rendall]], pp.&nbsp;1\u20132, 69.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Sound===\nThe [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] bore is primarily responsible for the clarinet's distinctive [[timbre]], which varies between its three main [[register (music)|registers]], known as the ''chalumeau'', ''clarion'', and ''altissimo''. The tone quality can vary greatly with the clarinetist, music, instrument, mouthpiece, and reed. The differences in instruments and geographical isolation of clarinetists led to the development from the last part of the 18th century onwards of several different schools of playing. The most prominent were the German/Viennese traditions and French school. The latter was centered on the clarinetists of the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].<ref>[[#Lawson|Lawson]], p. 87</ref> The proliferation of recorded music has made examples of different styles of playing available. The modern clarinetist has a diverse palette of \"acceptable\" tone qualities to choose from.\n\n[[File:clarinette basse.jpg|thumb|Bass clarinet|100px]]\nThe A and B{{music|flat}} clarinets have nearly the same bore and use the same mouthpiece.<ref>[[#Pino|Pino]], p. 26</ref> Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B{{music|flat}} instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B{{music|flat}} have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]] is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/instruments/e_flat_clarinet|title=Instrument: E-flat clarinet|publisher=Philharmonia Orchestra|author=McLaren, Jennifer|accessdate=2015-06-16}}</ref> The [[bass clarinet]] has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the [[alto clarinet]] is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Black, Dave |author2=Gerou, Tom |title=Essential Dictionary of Orchestration|publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=9781457412998|page=50}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\n{{main|clarinet family|E-flat clarinet|soprano clarinet|alto clarinet|bass clarinet|basset-horn|contra-alto clarinet|contrabass clarinet}}\nClarinets have the largest pitch [[Range (music)|range]] of common woodwinds.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Reed, Alfred|title=The Composer and the College Band|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=48|issue=1 |date=September 1961|pages=51\u201353|doi=10.2307/3389717|jstor=3389717}}</ref> The intricate [[key (instrument)|key]] organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward.

The chalumeau register is rich and dark. The clarion register is brighter and sweet, like a trumpet (''clarion'') heard from afar. The altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill.\n\n===Acoustics===\n[[File:Sound wave propagation in the soprano clarinet.jpg|thumb|Sound wave propagation in the soprano clarinet]]\n\n[[Sound]] is a [[wave]] that propagates through the air as a result of a local variation in [[air pressure]]. The production of sound by a clarinet follows these steps:<ref name=\"physics\">[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/clarinetacoustics.html#pipe Acoustics of the Clarinet] University of New South Wales.</ref>\n\n# The mouthpiece and reed are surrounded by the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In the same way a flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece.<br>At this point, the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Backus | first1 = J | year = 1961 | title = Vibrations of the Reed and the Air Column in the Clarinet | url = | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 806\u2013809 | doi = 10.1121/1.1908803 | bibcode = 1961ASAJ...33..806B }}</ref> The 'puff of air' or [[compression wave]] (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air<ref name=\"physics\"/>) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes at the point where the tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).\n# More than a 'neutral' amount of air escapes from the instrument, which creates a slight vacuum or [[rarefaction]] in the clarinet tube. This rarefaction wave travels back up the tube (image 2).\n# The rarefaction is reflected off the sloping end wall of the clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to the reflection of the rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared to the size of the tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).\n# When the rarefication wave reaches the other (open) end of the tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A little more than a 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a compression wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.\n# The original compression wave, now greatly reinforced by the second 'puff' of air, sets off on another two trips down the pipe (travelling 4 pipe lengths in total) before the cycle is repeated again.\n\nThe cycle repeats at a frequency relative to how long it takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (440 [[Hertz|Hz]]) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wam.hr/Arhiva/US/Cavanagh_440Hz.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104221535/http://www.wam.hr/Arhiva/US/Cavanagh_440Hz.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-04|title=A brief history of the establishment of international standard pitch a=440 hertz|last=Cavanagh|first=Lynn|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as [[harmonics]], are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening for part of the wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barthet | first1 = M. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = P. | last3 = Kronland-Martinet | first3 = R. | last4 = Ystad | first4 = S. | year = 2010 | title = From clarinet control to timbre perception | url = | journal = Acta Acustica united with Acustica | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 678\u2013689 |doi=10.3813/AAA.918322}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bore (wind instruments)|bore]] is [[Cylinder|cylindrical]] for most of the tube with an inner bore diameter between {{convert|14|and|15.5|mm|in}}, but there is a subtle [[hourglass]] shape, with the thinnest part below the junction between the upper and lower joint.<ref name=\"baines\">Baines, Anthony (1991).

The bell at the bottom of the clarinet flares out to improve the tone and tuning of the lowest notes.\n\nMost modern clarinets have \"undercut\" [[tone hole]]s that improve intonation and sound. Undercutting means [[chamfer]]ing the bottom edge of tone holes inside the bore. Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function as if it were larger, but its main function is to allow the air column to follow the curve up through the tone hole (surface tension) instead of \"blowing past\" it under the increasingly directional frequencies of the upper registers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gibson | first1 = Lee | year = 1968 | title = Fundamentals of Acoustical Design of the Soprano Clarinet | doi=10.2307/3391282 | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 113\u2013115 | jstor = 3391282 }}</ref>\n\nThe fixed reed and fairly uniform diameter of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical [[stopped pipe]].<ref name=\"physics\"/> [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorders]] use a tapered internal bore to [[Overblowing|overblow]] at the [[octave]] when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the [[Twelfth (interval)|twelfth]]. Adjusting the angle of the bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics).<ref name=\"physics\"/> Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations.<ref name=\"physics\"/> Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.\n\nThe lip position and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account for most of the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet.<ref>Almeida, A., Lemare, J., Sheahan, M., Judge, J., Auvray, R., Dang, K. S., Wolfe, J. (2010).

In ''Proc. Int. Symp. Music Acoustics''</ref> A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an [[embouchure]] which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure.<ref>[http://www.tcnj.edu/~mckinney/breathing.htm BREATHING]. Tcnj.edu. 2013.</ref> Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.\n\nCovering or uncovering the tone holes varies the length of the pipe, changing the [[acoustic resonance|resonant frequencies]] of the enclosed air column and hence the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].<ref name=\"physics\"/> A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the [[register key]]; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register \"the break\".<ref name=\"pinksterboer\"/> The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note.\n\nMost instruments [[overblow]] at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth.\n\nBy contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the [[ocarina]] and [[tonette]]) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B{{music|flat}}, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great [[Range (music)|range]] and complex [[Fingering (music)|fingering system]]. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further [[Interval (music)|sixth]] and [[Fourth (interval)|fourth]] (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register.<ref name=\"physics\" /> This is also why the inner \"waist\" measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.\n\nThe highest notes can have a shrill, piercing quality and can be difficult to tune accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.\n\nSince approximately 1850, clarinets have been nominally tuned according to twelve-tone [[equal temperament]]. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to [[meantone]]. A skilled performer can use his or her [[embouchure]] to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce [[vibrato]], a pulsating change of pitch often employed in [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drushler|first=P|year=1978|title=The clarinet vibrato|journal=Woodwind Anthology|location=Illinois}}</ref> [[Vibrato]] is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as [[Richard Stoltzman]], use vibrato in classical music.

In the past clarinetists used to wrap a string around the mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation of the mouth around the mouthpiece and reed is called the ''[[embouchure]]''.\n{{listen|filename=ClarinetReed.ogg|title=B{{music|b}} Clarinet reed and mouthpiece.|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nThe reed is on the underside of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure).<ref>[[#Pino|Pino]], p. 59</ref> Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.<ref>[[#Pino|Pino]], p. 38</ref>\n\n[[File:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-barrel.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Barrel of a B{{music|flat}} soprano clarinet]]\nNext is the short ''barrel''; this part of the instrument may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an [[orchestra]] or [[concert band]]). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.\n\n[[File:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-upper-joint.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Upper joint of a Boehm system clarinet]]\nThe main body of most clarinets is divided into the ''upper joint'', the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the ''lower joint'' with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a ''tone hole'' and the ''register key''. On some models of clarinet, such as many [[Albert system]] clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key on the back of the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090411230550/http://www.the-clarinets.net/clarinet-bore.html \"The bore\"]. the-clarinets.net</ref> Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120305003139/http://www.clarinetpages.net/vintage-odd-brands/what-s-my-french-stencil-clarinet-worth What's my French stencil clarinet worth?] clarinetpages.net</ref>\n\nThe body of a modern soprano clarinet is equipped with numerous ''[[tone hole]]s'' of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the [[Boehm system]] by its designer [[Hyacinthe Klos\u00e9]] in honour of [[flute]] designer [[Theobald Boehm]], but it is not the same as the [[Boehm system]] used on flutes.<ref name=\"ridley\">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/842134|last=Ridley|first=E.A.K.|date=September 1986|title=Birth of the 'Boehm' Clarinet|journal=The Galpin Society Journal|volume=39|pages=68\u201376|jstor=842134}}</ref> The other main system of keys is called the [[Oehler system]] and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see [[clarinet#History|History]]).<ref>[[#Lawson|Lawson]], p. 27-28</ref> The related Albert system is used by some [[jazz]], [[klezmer]], and eastern European folk musicians.<ref>[[#Lawson|Lawson]], p. 31</ref> The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early [[Ivan Mueller|Mueller system]].\n[[File:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-lower-joint.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lower Joint of a Boehm system clarinet]]\n\nThe cluster of keys at the bottom of the upper joint (protruding slightly beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the ''trill keys'' and are operated by the right hand.<ref name=\"pinksterboer\"/> These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and [[trill (music)|trills]].<ref name=\"pinksterboer\"/> The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the ''thumb-rest''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Janet|date=September 2001|title=An Orchestra Musician's Perspective on 20 Years of Performing Arts Medicine|journal=Medical Problems of Performing Artists|volume=16|issue=3|page=102}}</ref> Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.\n\n[[File:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-bell.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bell of a B{{music|flat}} soprano clarinet]]\nFinally, the flared end is known as the ''bell''.

Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klos\u00e9 and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because it was based on that used for flute.<ref>[[#Pino|Pino]], p. 210</ref>\n\nThe current Boehm key system consists of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key just above the thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key at the side of the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G{{music|#}} a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A{{music|#}}/B{{music|b}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clarinet 4 key anon Bate.jpg|right|thumb|100px|4-key boxwood clarinet, ca. 1760.]]\n\n===Lineage===\nThe clarinet has its roots in the early [[single-reed instrument]]s or [[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|hornpipes]] used in [[Ancient Greece]], old Egypt,<ref>[http://www.the-clarinets.net/english/clarinet-history.html Origin of the clarinet], the-clarinets.net</ref> [[Middle East]], and [[Europe]] since the [[Middle Ages]], such as the [[albogue]], [[alboka]], and [[double clarinet]].<ref>[[#Lawson|Lawson]], pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nThe modern clarinet developed from a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] instrument called the [[chalumeau]].

Early clarinets did not play well in the lower register, so players continued to play the chalumeaux for low notes.<ref name=\"karp\" /> As clarinets improved, the chalumeau fell into disuse, and these notes became known as the ''chalumeau register''. Original Denner clarinets had two keys, and could play a [[chromatic scale]], but various makers added more keys to get improved tuning, easier fingerings, and a slightly larger range.<ref name=\"karp\" /> The classical clarinet of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] day typically had eight finger holes and five keys.\n\nClarinets were soon accepted into orchestras.

Before about 1800, due to the lack of airtight pads ''(see [[#History|History]])'', practical woodwinds could have only a few keys to control accidentals (notes outside their diatonic home scales).<ref name=\"bray\"/> The low (chalumeau) register of the clarinet spans a twelfth (an octave plus a perfect fifth), so the clarinet needs keys/holes to produce all nineteen notes in this range. This involves more keywork than on instruments that \"overblow\" at the octave\u2014[[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s, [[bassoon]]s, and [[saxophone]]s, for example, which need only twelve notes before overblowing. Clarinets with few keys cannot therefore easily play chromatically, limiting any such instrument to a few closely related keys.<ref name=\"longyear\" /> For example, an eighteenth-century clarinet in C could be played in F, C, and G (and their relative minors) with good intonation, but with progressive difficulty and poorer intonation as the key moved away from this range.<ref name=\"longyear\">{{cite journal | last1 = Longyear | first1 = RM | year = 1983 | title = Clarinet Sonorities in Early Romantic Music |jstor=962035| url = http://jeremywoodwindsresourcefile.weebly.com/uploads/2/3/8/2/23826031/clarinet_sonorities_in_early_romantic_music.pdf | journal = The Musical Times | volume = 124 | issue = 1682| pages = 224\u2013226 | doi=10.2307/962035}}</ref> In contrast, for octave-overblowing instruments, an instrument in C with few keys could much more readily be played in any key. This problem was overcome by using three clarinets\u2014in A, B{{music|flat}}, and C\u2014so that early 19th-century music, which rarely strayed into the remote keys (five or six sharps or flats), could be played as follows: music in 5 to 2 sharps (B major to D major concert pitch) on A clarinet (D major to F major for the player), music in 1 sharp to 1 flat (G to F) on C clarinet, and music in 2 flats to 4 flats (B{{music|flat}} to A{{music|flat}}) on the B{{music|flat}} clarinet (C to B{{music|flat}} for the clarinetist). Difficult key signatures and numerous accidentals were thus largely avoided.\n\nWith the invention of the airtight pad, and as key technology improved and more keys were added to woodwinds, the need for clarinets in multiple keys was reduced.<ref name=\"Lawson, p. 25\">[[#Lawson|Lawson]], p. 25</ref> However, the use of multiple instruments in different keys persisted, with the three instruments in C, B{{music|flat}}, and A all used as specified by the composer.\n\nThe lower-pitched clarinets sound \"mellower\" (less bright), and the C clarinet\u2014being the highest and therefore brightest of the three\u2014fell out of favour as the other two could cover its range and their sound was considered better.<ref name=\"longyear\"/> While the clarinet in C began to fall out of general use around 1850, some composers continued to write C parts after this date, e.g., [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]] (1855), [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 2]] (1872), [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana]]'s overture to ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' (1866) and ''[[M\u00e1 vlast|M\u00e1 Vlast]]'' (1874), [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's]] ''[[Slavonic Dances|Slavonic Dance]]'' Op. 46, No. 1 (1878), [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No.&nbsp;4]] (1885), [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 6 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 6]] (1906), and [[Richard Strauss]] deliberately reintroduced it{{clarify|date=August 2015}}<!--Does this mean he had stopped using it earlier, or that no one at all had used it for a long time until Strauss used it in Rosenkavalier?--> to take advantage of its brighter tone, as in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911).<ref>[[#Lawson|Lawson]], pp. 42, 63</ref>\n\nWhile technical improvements and an equal-tempered scale reduced the need for two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical.<ref name=\"Lawson, p. 25\"/> Attempts were made to standardise to the B{{music|flat}} instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B{{music|flat}} clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E{{music|flat}} on the B{{music|flat}} to match the range of the A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.\n\nSimilarly there have been E{{music|flat}} and D instruments in the upper soprano range, B{{music|flat}}, A, and C instruments in the bass range, and so forth; but over time the E{{music|flat}} and B{{music|flat}} instruments have become predominant.<ref name=\"cambridge\">[[#Lawson|Lawson]]</ref> The B{{music|flat}} instrument remains dominant in concert bands and jazz.

In the 20th century, composers such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Gustav Mahler]], and [[Olivier Messiaen]] enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E{{music|flat}} or D soprano clarinets, [[Basset-horn|basset horn]], [[alto clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], and/or [[contrabass clarinet]].\n\nIn concert bands, clarinets are an important part of the instrumentation. The E{{music|flat}} clarinet, B{{music|flat}} clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B{{music|flat}} clarinets; there are commonly 3 B{{music|flat}} clarinet parts with 2\u20133 players per part.

Rarely used today.\n| [[File:cor basset F reel.JPG|100 px]]\n|-\n| [[Alto clarinet]]\n| E{{music|flat}} or F\n| Sometimes referred to (mostly in Europe) as the [[tenor]] clarinet. Its greater size and consequently lower pitch give it a rich, dark sonority capable of greater resonance than the soprano instruments, but with less projection than the larger [[bass clarinet]]. It is used in chamber music and concert bands, and occasionally, if rarely, in orchestras.  A few players have specialized in using the alto in jazz (e.g. [[Gianluigi Trovesi]]).  The alto in F is considered obsolete.<ref>[[#Pino|Pino]], p. 219</ref>\n| [[File:clar alto Eb reel.JPG|100 px]]\n|-\n| [[Bass clarinet]]\n| B{{music|flat}} or A\n| Invented in the 1770s it only became popular around a hundred years later when it contributed to the rich orchestral palettes of composers such as [[Wagner]] and the late [[Romantics]]. It has become a mainstay of the modern orchestra. Originally the third clarinet would double on bass but now most orchestras employ a specialist devoted principally to this instrument.<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> It is used in concert bands, contemporary music, and enjoys, along with the B{{Music|flat}} clarinet, a considerable r\u00f4le in jazz. [[Eric Dolphy]] was one of its more remarkable exponents.  The bass clarinet in A, which had a vogue among certain composers from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries, is now so rare as to usually be considered obsolete.<ref>[http://www.europeanclarinetassociation.org/uploads/media/Bass_Clarinet_in_A_-_Keith_Bowen.pdf  THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BASS CLARINET IN A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228195253/http://www.europeanclarinetassociation.org/uploads/media/Bass_Clarinet_in_A_-_Keith_Bowen.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}</ref>\n| [[File:clar bas Bb reel.JPG|100 px]]\n|-\n| [[Contra-alto clarinet|E{{music|flat}} contrabass clarinet]] (also called Contraalto clarinet)\n| EE{{music|flat}}\n| Used in clarinet choirs and is common in concert bands.<ref name=\"cambridge\"/>\n| [[File:clar ctalto Eb reel.JPG|100 px]]\n|-\n| [[Contrabass clarinet]] (also called B{{music|flat}} subcontrabass or double-bass clarinet)\n| BB{{music|flat}}\n| Used in clarinet choirs and is common in concert bands.

The largest boom Chojn\u00f3w experienced was in the 16th century, however by the end of that century began to decline due to fires and epidemic, which claimed many victims in 1613[[Anno Domini|AD]].\n\nFrom 1618 to 1648 (during the [[Thirty Years War]]), there was another outbreak in the city and in 1740 Chojn\u00f3w was conqored by the [[Prussia]]ns.\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic wars]] there were more epidemics.

It is a small northern constellation that was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in the 17th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for \"[[hunting dog]]s\", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [[Bo\u00f6tes]] the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation. [[Cor Caroli]] is the constellation's brightest star, with an apparent magnitude of 2.9. [[La Superba]] is one  of the reddest stars in the sky and one of the brightest carbon stars. The [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] tilted face-on to observers on Earth, and was the first galaxy whose spiral nature was discerned.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Canes Venatici.gif|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius's star atlas.

In classical times, they were listed by [[Ptolemy]] as unfigured stars below the constellation [[Ursa Major]] in his [[star catalogue]].  \n\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], the identification of these stars with the dogs of Bo\u00f6tes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Bo\u00f6tes's stars were traditionally described as representing the [[Club (weapon)|club]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, kollorobos'') of Bo\u00f6tes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was translated from Greek to [[Arabic]], the translator [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] did not know the Greek word and rendered it as a similar-sounding Arabic word for a weapon, writing ''al-`a\u015f\u0101 dh\u0101t al-kull\u0101b'' (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0627 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0628), which means \"the spearshaft having a hook\". When the Arabic text was later translated into [[Latin]], the translator [[Gerard of Cremona]] mistook ''kull\u0101b'', meaning \"hook\", for ''kil\u0101b'' (which looks the same in unvowelled Arabic text), meaning \"dogs\", writing ''hastile habens canes'' (\"spearshaft having dogs\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=105}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1959|pp=123\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1974|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1990|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\nIn 1533, the German astronomer [[Peter Apian]] depicted Bo\u00f6tes as having two dogs with him.<ref name=apian1>{{Harvnb|Apianus|1533}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=157}}</ref>\n\nThese spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canesvenatici.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Canes Venatici |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ridpath\">{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=96\u201397}}</ref> Hevelius chose the name ''Asterion'' (from the Greek '\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, meaning the \"little star\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|Smart|2006|p=22}}</ref> the [[diminutive]] of '\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 the \"star\", or adjective meaning \"starry\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=115}}</ref>) for the northern dog and ''Chara'' (from the Greek \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac, meaning \"joy\") for the southern dog, as ''Canes Venatici'', the Hunting Dogs, in his [[star atlas]].<ref name=\"ridpath\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Hevelius|1690}}</ref>\nIn his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer [[Anton\u00edn Be\u010dv\u00e1\u0159|Be\u010dv\u00e1\u0159]] assigned the names ''Asterion'' to \u03b2 CVn and ''Chara'' to \u03b1 CVn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Be\u010dv\u00e1\u0159|1951}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nCanes Venatici is bordered by [[Ursa Major]] to the north and west, [[Coma Berenices]] to the south, and [[Bo\u00f6tes]] to the east.

H. Allen (''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''), the star was named by Halley for Charles II \"at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the king's return to London, May 29, 1660\". According to Deborah J. Warner (''The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800''), it was originally named \"Cor Caroli Regis Martyris\" (\"The Heart of King Charles the Martyr\") for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. (''Burnham's Celestial Handbook'', Volume 1), \"the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification\".</ref> Legend has it that \u03b1 CVn was brighter than usual during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide [[double star]], with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.<ref name=\"ridpath\"/>\n*[[Beta Canum Venaticorum]], or Chara, is a yellow-hued [[main sequence star]] of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for \"joy\".<ref name=\"ridpath\"/>\n*[[Y Canum Venaticorum]] ([[La Superba]]) is a [[semiregular variable star]] that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days.

It may be possibly the [[List of largest cosmic structures#List of largest known voids|largest void]] ever discovered, slightly larger than the [[CMB cold spot|Eridanus Supervoid]] and 1,200 times the volume of expected typical voids. It was discovered in 1988 in a deep-sky survey.\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\n\nCanes Venatici contains five [[Messier object]]s, including four [[galaxy|galaxies]]. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] (M51, NGC 5194) and [[NGC 5195]], a small barred [[spiral galaxy]] that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845.<ref name=\"ridpath\"/> It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many [[star formation|star-forming regions]] and [[nebula]]e in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, NGC 5195, that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow.

[[Alpha Chamaeleontis]] is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.1, 63 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Chamaeleontis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Chamaeleontis]] is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 4.1, 413 light-years from Earth. The other bright star in Chamaeleon is [[Delta Chamaeleontis]], a wide [[double star]]. The brighter star is [[Delta2 Chamaeleontis|Delta<sup>2</sup> Chamaeleontis]], a blue-hued star of magnitude 4.4. [[Delta1 Chamaeleontis|Delta<sup>1</sup> Chamaeleontis]], the dimmer component, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.5. They both lie about 350 light years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|p=118}}\n\nChamaeleon is also the location of [[Cha 110913]], a unique dwarf star or proto solar system.\n\n=== Deep-sky objects ===\nIn 1999, a nearby [[open cluster]] was discovered centered on the star [[Eta Chamaeleontis|\u03b7 Chamaeleontis]]. The cluster, known as either\nthe [[Eta Chamaeleontis cluster]] or Mamajek 1, is 8 million years old, and lies 316 [[light years]] from Earth.{{sfn|Luhman|Steeghs|2004|p=917}}\n\nThe constellation contains a number of [[molecular clouds]] (the [[Chamaeleon complex|Chamaeleon dark clouds]]) that are forming low-mass [[T Tauri star]]s. The cloud complex lies some 400 to 600 [[light years]] from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. The most prominent cluster of T Tauri stars and young B-type stars are in the Chamaeleon I cloud, and are associated with the reflection nebula [[IC 2631]].\n\nChamaeleon contains one planetary nebula, [[NGC 3195]], which is fairly faint.

When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.\n\nThe cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]].

HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]].

Instead, cholesterol is transported within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via [[emulsification]]. [[Triglyceride]]s and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThere are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native \"free\" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80\u2013100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nChylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|author1=Mahley|first1=R.

Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.\n\nVLDL molecules are produced by the liver from triacylglycerol and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and are degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the blood vessel wall to IDL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBlood vessels cleave and absorb triacylglycerol from IDL molecules, increasing the concentration of cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules, with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWhen this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation.

Chromatin fiber is made of [[nucleosome]]s ([[histone octamer]]s with part of a DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it). Chromatin fibers are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called [[chromatin]]. Chromatin contains the vast majority of DNA and a [[Mitochondrial DNA|small amount]] inherited maternally, can be found in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Chromatin is present in most [[Cell (biology)|cells]], with a few exceptions, for example, [[red blood cell]]s.\n\nChromatin allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the [[cell nucleus]]. During cell division chromatin condenses further to form microscopically visible chromosomes. The structure of chromosomes varies through the [[cell cycle]]. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their [[offspring|progeny]]. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called [[chromatids]] or [[sister chromatids]]) joined by a [[centromere]].\n\n[[File:Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|center|850px|The major structures in DNA compaction: [[DNA]], the [[nucleosome]], the 10&nbsp;nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre, the 30&nbsp;nm fibre and the [[metaphase]] chromosome.]]\n[[Eukaryotes]] ([[cell (biology)|cells]] with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [[centromere]], with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[Mitochondrial DNA|genome]], and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [[cytoplasm]]ic chromosomes.\n\nIn the nuclear chromosomes of [[eukaryote]]s, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [[histone]]s (structural [[protein]]s), forming a composite material called [[chromatin]].\n\n=== Interphase chromatin ===\nDuring [[interphase]] (the period of the [[cell cycle]] where the cell is not dividing), two types of [[chromatin]] can be distinguished:\n* [[Euchromatin]], which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein.\n* [[Heterochromatin]], which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types:\n** ''Constitutive heterochromatin'', which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].\n** ''Facultative heterochromatin'', which is sometimes expressed.\n'''Structure of Eukaryotic chromosome'''\n# Each chromosome is made up of <u>'''two chromatids'''</u> (chromosomal arms) which are joined to each other at a small constricted region called the centromere ('''primary constriction'''). These sister chromatids are conjoined twins the result of DNA replication.  \n# The centromere helps the chromatids  attach to the spindle fibres during cell division, it is also concerned with the '''<u>anaphase movement</u>''' of the chromosomes, by which the spindle fibers pull the chromatids to the two opposite poles by their contraction during anaphase. \n# Besides the primary constriction, in certain chromosomes there is a secondary constriction as well. Because a small portion is pinched off from the chromosomal body; this portion is called a 'satellite' and the chromosome is called an SAT chromosome. \n# The two chromatids are made up of very thin chromatin fibres which are made up of 40% DNA and 60% histone proteins \n# Each chromatin fibre consists of one DNA helix coiled around eight histone molecules like a loop; such a complex is called nucleosome and resembles a bead on a string.  These nucleosomes pack tighter, during condensation required to get to metaphase.  \n# The primary constriction cannot take up most stains, so during cell division this region is a gap in staining. \n# Within the primary constriction there is a clear zone called Centromere. \n# The centromere with the DNA and histone proteins bound to them form a disc shaped structure called '''''kinetochore'''''. \n# the chromonemata is a word that means a chromatid in the early stage of condensation. \n#\n\n=== Metaphase chromatin and division ===\n{{see also|mitosis|meiosis}}\n<!-- too many pictures! [[File:ChickenChromosomesBMC Genomics5-56Fig4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chicken chromosomes during [[metaphase]], with highlighted [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]]] -->\n[[File:HumanChromosomesChromomycinA3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Human chromosomes during [[metaphase]]]]\nIn the early stages of [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]] (cell division), the chromatin double helix become more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister [[chromatids]] attached to each other at the [[centromere]]. The shorter arms are called ''p arms'' (from the [[French language|French]] ''petit'', small) and the longer arms are called ''q arms'' (''q'' follows ''p'' in the Latin alphabet; q-g \"grande\"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for ''queue'' meaning tail in French<ref>\"[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/chromosome-mapping-idiograms-302 Chromosome Mapping: Idiograms]\" ''Nature Education'' - August 13, 2013</ref>). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [[microscope]].\n\nMitotic metaphase chromosomes are best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.<ref name=\"pmid24200812\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Naumova N, Imakaev M, Fudenberg G, Zhan Y, Lajoie BR, Mirny LA, Dekker J | title = Organization of the mitotic chromosome | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6161 | pages = 948\u201353 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24200812 | pmc = 4040465 | doi = 10.1126/science.1236083 | bibcode = 2013Sci...342..948N }}</ref>\n\nDuring mitosis, [[microtubule]]s grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called [[kinetochores]], one of which is present on each sister [[chromatid]]. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.\n\n=== Human chromosomes ===\nChromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: [[autosome]]s (body chromosome(s)) and allosome ([[sex chromosome]](s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [[mitochondrial genome]]. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [[Sanger Institute]]'s human genome information in the [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database]].<ref>[http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html Vega.sanger.ad.uk], all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008.</ref> Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on [[gene prediction]]s.

When a male and a female gamete merge ([[fertilization]]), a new diploid organism is formed.\n\nSome animal and plant species are [[polyploid]] [Xn]: They have more than two sets of [[homologous chromosome]]s. Plants important in agriculture such as [[tobacco]] or [[wheat]] are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some [[cultivar]]s as well as the wild progenitors. The more-common [[pasta]] and [[bread]] wheat types are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sakamura |first1=Tetsu |date=1918 |title= Kurze Mitteilung \u00fcber die Chromosomenzahlen und die Verwandtschaftsverh\u00e4ltnisse der Triticum-Arten |journal= Shokubutsugaku Zasshi |volume=32 |issue=379 |pages=150\u20133 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jplantres1887/32/379/32_379_150/_article |doi=10.15281/jplantres1887.32.379_150}}</ref>\n\n=== In prokaryotes ===\n[[Prokaryote]] [[species]] generally have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies.<ref>Charlebois R.L.

There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.\nIn some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:\n:1. variation between the two sexes\n:2. variation between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma (biology)|soma]] (between [[gamete]]s and the rest of the body)\n:3. variation between members of a population, due to [[polymorphism (biology)|balanced genetic polymorphism]]\n:4. [[allopatric speciation|geographical variation]] between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]\n:5. [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.\nAlso, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilized egg.\n\nThe technique of determining the karyotype is usually called ''karyotyping''. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [[in vitro]] (in a reaction vial) with [[colchicine]]. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a ''karyogram'', with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end.\n\nLike many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [[XY sex-determination system|gonosomes]] (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [[autosome]]s). These are XX in females and XY in males. <!--- Irrelevant in this section:\"In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactive and can be seen under a microscope as [[Barr body|Barr bodies]].\"--->\n\n=== Historical note ===\n{{see also|Argument from authority#Use in science}}\nInvestigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: ''How many chromosomes does a normal [[diploid]] human cell contain?''

Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, without the characteristic folded hand.\n* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister\u2013Killian syndrome]].\n* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX).

A member of the Franciscan Order, she was beatified by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1848.\n\nAt this time, a rivalry began with the pro-papal Orsini family, leaders of the Guelph faction. This reinforced the pro-Emperor Ghibelline course that the Colonna family followed throughout the period of conflict between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n===Colonna versus Papacy===\nIn 1297, Cardinal Jacopo ([[Giacomo Colonna]]) disinherited his brothers Ottone, Matteo, and Landolfo of their lands. The latter three appealed to [[Pope Boniface VIII]], who ordered Jacopo to return the land, and furthermore hand over the family's strongholds of Colonna, [[Palestrina]], and other towns to the [[Papacy]]. Jacopo refused; in May, Boniface removed him from the [[College of Cardinals]] and excommunicated him and his followers.\n\nThe Colonna family (aside from the three brothers allied with the Pope) declared that Boniface had been elected illegally following the unprecedented [[papal abdication|abdication]] of [[Pope Celestine V]]. The dispute led to open warfare, and in September, Boniface appointed Landolfo to the command of his army, to put down the revolt of Landolfo's own Colonna relatives. By the end of 1298, Landolfo had captured [[Colonna]], [[Palestrina]] and other towns, and razed them to the ground. The family's lands were distributed among Landolfo and his loyal brothers; the rest of the family fled Italy.\n\nThe exiled Colonnas allied with the Pope's other great enemy, [[Philip IV of France]], who in his youth had been tutored by Cardinal [[Egidio Colonna]]. In September 1303, Sciarra and Philipp's advisor, [[Guillaume de Nogaret]], led a small force into [[Anagni]] to arrest Boniface VIII and bring him to France, where he was to stand trial. The two managed to apprehend the pope, and Sciarra reportedly slapped the pope in the face in the process, which was accordingly dubbed the \"Outrage of Anagni\". The attempt eventually failed after a few days, when locals freed the pope. However, Boniface VIII died on 11 October, allowing France to dominate his weaker successors during the [[Avignon papacy]].\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nThe family remained at the centre of civic and religious life throughout the late Middle Ages. Cardinal [[Egidio Colonna]] died at the papal court in [[Avignon]] in 1314. An Augustinian, he had studied theology in Paris under St. [[Thomas of Aquinas]] to become one of the most authoritative thinkers of his time.\n\nIn the 14th century, the family sponsored the decoration of the Church of [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|San Giovanni]], most notably the floor mosaics.\n\nIn 1328, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV of Germany]] marched into Italy for his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. As [[Pope John XXII]] was residing in Avignon and had publicly declared that he would not crown Louis, the King decided to be crowned by a member of the Roman aristocracy, who proposed Sciarra Colonna. In honor of this event, the Colonna family was granted the privilege of using the imperial pointed crown on top of their coat of arms.\n\nThe celebrated poet [[Petrarch]], was a great friend of the family, in particular of [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295-1348)|Giovanni Colonna]] and often lived in Rome as a guest of the family. He composed a number of sonnets for special occasions within the Colonna family, including \"Colonna the Glorious, the great Latin name upon which all our hopes rest\". In this period, the Colonna started claiming they were descendants of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Trevi - palazzo colonna e basilica santi apostoli 01.JPG|right|thumb|[[Palazzo Colonna]] in Rome (begun by [[Pope Martin V]], to this day residence of the family)]]\nAt the [[Council of Constance]], the Colonna finally succeeded in their papal ambitions when [[Pope Martin V|Oddone Colonna]] was elected on 14 November 1417. As Martin V, he reigned until his death on 20 February 1431.\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[Vittoria Colonna]] became famous in the sixteenth century as a poet and a figure in literate circles.\n\nIn 1627 [[Anna Colonna]], daughter of [[Filippo I Colonna]], married [[Taddeo Barberini]] of the family [[Barberini]]; nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]].\n\nIn 1728, the Carbognano branch (Colonna di Sciarra) of the Colonna family added the name [[Barberini]] to its family name<ref>[http://worldroots.com/foundation/families/taddeobarberinidesc.htm Worldroots - Barberini] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015021941/http://worldroots.com/foundation/families/taddeobarberinidesc.htm |date=October 15, 2009 }}</ref> when Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra married Cornelia Barberini, daughter of the last male Barberini to hold the name and granddaughter of [[Maffeo Barberini (1631-1685)|Maffeo Barberini]] (son of [[Taddeo Barberini]]).\n\n===Current status===\nThe Colonna family have been [[Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne]]<ref>[http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm Article by Guy de Stair Sainty on Papal Court] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313165610/http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm |date=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> since 1710, though their papal princely title only dates from 1854.\n\nThe family residence in Rome, the [[Palazzo Colonna]], is open to the public every Saturday morning.\n\nThe main 'Colonna di Paliano' family is represented today by Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince and Duke of Paliano (b. 1948), whose heir is Don Giovanni Andrea Colonna di Paliano (b. 1975), and by Don Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince of Avella (b. 1956), whose heir is Don Filippo Colonna di Paliano (b. 1995).\n\nThe 'Colonna di Stigliano' line is represented by Don Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince of Stigliano (b. 1938), whose heir is his nephew Don Stefano Colonna di Stigliano (b. 1975).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/colonna.html|title=Colonna|website=www.angelfire.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n[[File:Pisanello, copia da Ritratto di Martino V (Galleria Colonna).jpg|thumb|Oddo Colonna (1368\u20131431), since 1417 [[Pope Martin V]]]]\n[[File:WP Prospero Colonna.jpg|thumb|[[Prospero Colonna]] (1452\u20131523), papal condottiere]]\n* Blessed [[Margherita Colonna]] (c. 1255 \u2013 1280).\n* [[Stefano Colonna]] (1265 \u2013 c. 1348), an influential noble in Medieval Rome and Imperial vicar in the early 14th century.\n* [[Giacomo Colonna]] (1270\u20131329), who took part in the Outrage of Anagni against [[Pope Boniface VIII]].\n* [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295-1348)|Giovanni Colonna]] (1295\u20131348), influential [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] during the [[Avignon papacy]].\n* Oddone Colonna (1369\u20131431), whose election as [[Pope Martin V]] in 1417 ended the [[Western Schism]].\n* [[Fabrizio Colonna]] (c. 1450 \u2013 1520), who was the father of [[Vittoria Colonna]], and a general in the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]].\n* [[Prospero Colonna]] (1452\u20131523), who fought alongside his cousin Fabrizio Colonna.\n* [[Francesco Colonna (born 1453)|Francesco Colonna]] (1453? \u2013 1517?)
