Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or [[natural resource]]s in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product. The division of labour is the motive for [[trade]] and the source of [[economic interdependence]].\n\nAfter the Neolithic Revolution, pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labor, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites.  This specialization was furthered by the process of [[industrialisation]], and [[Industrial Revolution]]-era factories.  Accordingly many [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as well as some mechanical engineers such as [[Charles Babbage]] were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with lesser paid but more productive unskilled workers.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Exploring the Black Box: Technology, economics and history\n |last=Rosenberg\n |first= Nathan\n|year=1993 |publisher =Cambridge University Press\n|location=\n|isbn= 0 521 459559|pages=25, 27\u201332, 37\u20138\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref> Historically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[trade]], the rise of [[capitalism]], and the increasing complexity of [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient [[Sumer]]ian ([[Mesopotamia]]n) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\n\nIn contrast to division of labour, division of work refers to the division of a large task, contract, or project into smaller tasks\u2014each with a separate schedule within the overall project schedule. Division of labour, instead, refers to the allocation of tasks to individuals or organizations according to the skills and/or equipment those people or organizations possess. Often division of labour and division of work are both part of the economic activity within an industrial nation or organization.\n\n== Theorists ==\n\n=== Plato ===\nIn [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', the origin of the state lies in the natural inequality of humanity, which is embodied in the division of labour.\n\n{{quote|Well then, how will our state supply these needs? It will need a farmer, a builder, and a weaver, and also, I think, a shoemaker and one or two others to provide for our bodily needs. So that the minimum state would consist of four or five men.... (''The Republic'', p. 103, Penguin Classics edition.)}}\n\nSilvermintz notes that, \"Historians of economic thought credit Plato, primarily on account of arguments advanced in his Republic, as an early proponent of the division of labour.\" Notwithstanding this, Silvermintz argues that, \"While Plato recognizes both the economic and political benefits of the division of labour, he ultimately critiques this form of economic arrangement insofar as it hinders the individual from ordering his own soul by cultivating acquisitive motives over prudence and reason.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silvermintz|first=Daniel|title=Plato's Supposed Defense of the Division of Labor: A Reexamination of the Role of Job Specialization in the Republic|journal=History of Political Economy|year=2010|volume=42|issue=4|pages=747\u201372|url=http://hope.dukejournals.org/content/42/4/747.abstract|doi=10.1215/00182702-2010-036}}</ref>\n\n=== Xenophon ===\n[[Xenophon]], in the fourth century BC, makes a passing reference to division of labour in his '[[Cyropaedia]]' (a.k.a. [[Cyropaedia|Education of Cyrus]]).\n\n{{quote|Just as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities, in the same way food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner. In small towns the same man makes couches, doors, ploughs and tables, and often he even builds houses, and still he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself. And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well. In large cities, however, because many make demands on each trade, one alone is enough to support a man, and often less than one: for instance one man makes shoes for men, another for women, there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes, another by cutting them out, another just by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts, Of necessity, he who pursues a very specialized task will do it best.<ref>Book VIII, ch, ii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA4ohkXjeF4C&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=cyropaedia+xenophon+I%22in+small+towns%22&source=bl&ots=rirS1vn2bT&sig=WAizKVoTZo7saTHrRQI3akwpy7s&hl=en&ei=_8Y_SvWpN4rAM5KMjKkO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 4[&#93;-6], cited in ''[[The Ancient Economy (book)|The Ancient Economy]]'' by M.

In his [[Muqaddimah]], he states:\n{{quote|The power of the individual human being is not sufficient for him to obtain (the food) he needs, and does not provide him with as much as he requires to live. Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food...that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation...Thus, he cannot do without a combination of many powers from among his fellow beings, if he is to obtain food for himself and for them.

Classically the workers in a [[shipyard]] would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organized with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on [[political economy]].\n\nPetty also applied the principle to his survey of [[Ireland]]. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.\n\n=== Bernard de Mandeville ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] discusses the matter in the second volume of ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714).  This elaborates many matters raised by the original poem about a 'Grumbling Hive'. He says:\n{{quote|But if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one of the Five.}}\n\n=== David Hume ===\n\n{{quote|When every individual person labors apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labor being employed in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employments, our ability increases: And by mutual succor we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. \u2019Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous.}}\n\n=== Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau ===\nIn his introduction to ''Art de l'\u00c9pinglier'' [The Art of the Pin-Maker] (1761),<ref>R. R\u00e9aumur and A. de Ferchault. Art de l'\u00c9pinglier avec des additions de M. Duhamel du Monceau et des remarques extraites des m\u00e9moires de M. Perronet, inspecteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es. Paris, Saillant et Nyon, 1761.</ref> [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] writes about the \"division of this work\":<ref>[[:File:Duhamel.jpg|Scan]] of the text of \"l'Art de l'\u00c9pinglier\", with the expression \"division de ce travail\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|There is nobody who is not surprised of the small price of [[pin]]s; but we shall be even more surprised, when we know how many different operations, most of them very delicate, are mandatory to make a good pin. We are going to go through these operations in a few words to stimulate the curiosity to know their detail; this enumeration will supply as many articles which will make the division of this work. [...] The first operation is to have brass go through the drawing plate to calibrate it. [...]}}\n\nBy \"division of this work\", Duhamel du Monceau is referring to the subdivisions of the text describing the various trades involved in the pin making activity; this can also be described as division of labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith ===\n\nIn the first sentence of ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]] foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a substantial increase in productivity. Like du Monceau, his example was the making of pins. Unlike [[Plato]], Smith famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialization determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book Smith criticizes the division of labour saying it can lead to \"the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people. \u2026 unless government takes some pains to prevent it.\"<ref>\"The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgement concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life... But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.\", ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]]</ref> The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=The Celebrated Adam Smith|url=https://mises.org/page/1430|website=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=2012-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015921/http://mises.org/page/1430|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] agreed with Smith: \"Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |year= 1841 |title= Democracy in America: Volume I |location= New York, NY |publisher= J.&nbsp;& H.&nbsp;G.

For example, pin makers were organized with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment.  Similarly he emphasised a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship.\n\nIn modern economic discussion, the term [[human capital]] would be used.  Smith's insight suggests that the huge increases in productivity obtainable from [[technology]] or technological progress are possible because human and physical capital are matched, usually in an organization. See also a short discussion of Adam Smith's theory in the context of [[Pin Factory|business processes]].\n\nBabbage wrote a seminal work \"On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures\" analyzing perhaps for the first time the division of labour in factories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|title=Babbage: pioneer economist by Nathan Rosenberg|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/babbage/rosenb.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\nIn the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of morals]]'' 1785, Kant notes the value of the division of labour:<blockquote>All crafts, trades and arts have profited from the division of labour; for when each worker sticks to one particular kind of work that needs to be handled differently from all the others, he can do it better and more easily than when one person does everything. Where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg|website=Project Gutenberg|access-date=2016-11-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nMarx argued that increasing the specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. He described the process as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]: workers become more and more specialized and work becomes repetitive, eventually leading to complete alienation from the process of production. The worker then becomes \"depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine\".<ref>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, 1844, First Manuscript, in T.B. Bottomore, Karl Marx Early Writings, C.A. Watts and Co. Ltd., London, 1963, p.&nbsp;72</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Marx argued that division of labour creates less-skilled workers. As the work becomes more specialized, less training is needed for each specific job, and the workforce, overall, is less skilled than if one worker did one job entirely.<ref>Wage Labor & Capital</ref>\n\nAmong Marx's theoretical contributions is his sharp distinction between the economic and the [[social division of labor]].<ref>Marx, K. (1977). ''[[Capital, Volume I|Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1.]]'' New York: Vintage Books, pp. 781\u201394.</ref> That is, some forms of labour co-operation are purely due to \"technical necessity\", but others are a result of a \"social control\" function related to a class and status hierarchy. If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by [[Power (sociology)|power]] relationships. He also argues that in a [[communism|communist]] society, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.<ref>Ali Rattansi: Marx and the Division of Labor (Macmillan, 1982)</ref>\n\n=== Henry David Thoreau ===\n[[Henry David Thoreau]] criticized the division of labour in ''[[Walden]]'' (published in 1854), on the basis that it removes people from a sense of connectedness with society and with the world at large, including nature. He claimed that the average man in a civilized society is less wealthy, in practice, than one in a \"savage\" society. The answer he gave was that [[self-sufficiency]] was enough to cover one's basic needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThoreau's friend and mentor, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], criticized the division of labour in \"The American Scholar\"; a widely informed, holistic citizenry is vital for the spiritual and physical health of the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== \u00c9mile Durkheim ===\nIn his seminal work, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]<ref>A founding father of sociology, Emile Durkheim, best known for his 1893 seminal work, ''De La Division Du Travail Social'' (''The Division of Labor in Society''),\"dedicated himself to the establishment of sociology as a legitimate and respected science and as an instrument of rational social action.\" {{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462\u201365 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}</ref> observes that the division of labour appears in all societies and positively correlates with societal advancement because it increases as a society progresses. Durkheim arrived at the same conclusion regarding the positive effects of the division of labour as his theoretical predecessor, [[Adam Smith]].  In ''The Wealth of the Nations'', Smith observes the division of labour results in \"a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labor.\"<ref>Smith, Adam. ''The Wealth of Nations''.  Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1970.</ref>  While they shared this belief, Durkheim believed the division of labour applied to all \"biological organisms generally\" while Smith believed this law applied \"only to human societies.\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\">Jones, Robert. ''Emile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works.'' Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications, Inc., 1986. Print.</ref>  This difference may result from the influence of [[Charles Darwin]]\u2019s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' on Durkheim\u2019s writings.<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" />  For example, Durkheim observed an apparent relationship between \"the functional specialization of the parts of an organism\" and \"the extent of that organism's evolutionary development,\" which he believed \"extended the scope of the division of labour so as to make its origins contemporaneous with the origins of life itself\u2026implying that its conditions must be found in the essential properties of all organized matter.\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" />\n\nSince Durkheim\u2019s division of labour applied to all organisms, he considered it a \"[[natural law]]\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" /> and worked to determine whether it should be embraced or resisted by first analysing its functions.  Durkheim hypothesized that the division of labour fosters [[social solidarity]], yielding \"a wholly moral phenomenon\" that ensures \"mutual relationships\" among individuals.<ref name=\"DurkheimEmile\">Durkheim, Emile. ''The Division of Labor in Society.''  New York: The Free Press, 1997.

It is argued that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within capitalism, and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is downplayed as mere romantic fiction.\n\n=== Friedrich A. Hayek ===\nIn ''[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]'', [[Friedrich A. Hayek]] states:\n\n{{quote|The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a division of labour but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labour on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the \"state\" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.<ref>Editor/Trans.First Pub.

American Economic Association Author Hayek, Friedrich A.</ref>}}\n\n== Globalization and global division of labour ==\nThe issue reaches its broadest scope in the controversies about [[globalization]], which is often interpreted as a euphemism for the expansion of world trade based on [[comparative advantage]].\nThis would mean that countries specialize in the work they can do at the lowest relative cost measured in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of not using resources for other work, compared to the opportunity costs experienced countries. Critics, however, allege that international specialization cannot be explained sufficiently in terms of \"the work nations do best\", rather this specialization is guided more by [[commerce|commercial]] criteria, which favour some countries over others.\n\nThe [[OECD]] recently advised (28 June 2005) that:\n\n{{quote|Efficient policies to encourage employment and combat unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalization and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalization... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible.}}\n\nFew studies have taken place regarding the global division of labour.  Information can be drawn from [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and national statistical offices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn one study, [[Deon Filmer]] estimated that 2.474 billion people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these,\n* around 15%, or 379 million people, worked in industry,\n* a third, or 800 million worked in services, and\n* over 40%, or 1,074 million, in agriculture.\n\nThe majority of workers in industry and services were wage and salary earners \u2013 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion were self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services. The 2007 ILO Global Employment Trends Report indicated that services have surpassed agriculture for the first time in human history: \"In 2006 the service sector\u2019s share of global employment overtook agriculture for the first time, increasing from 39.5 per cent to 40 per cent. Agriculture decreased from 39.7 per cent to 38.7 per cent.

In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just.\n\nTwo styles of management that are seen in modern organizations are control and commitment, control being the division of labour style of the past and commitment being the style of the future. Control management is based on the principles of job specialization and the division of labour. This is the [[assembly line]] style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">McAlister-Kizzier, Donna. \"Division of Labor.\"  Encyclopedia of Business and Finance, 2nd ed.. 2007.

However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIt is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour hierarchy is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.\n\nSize, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nIt is often agreed{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability. This important concept of [[meritocracy]] could be read as an [[explanation]] or as a justification of why a division of labour is the way it is.\n\nIn general, in capitalist economies, such things are not decided consciously.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.  This does not present a problem,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} as the only requirement of a capitalist system is that you turn a profit.\n\n==Limitations==\n\n[[Adam Smith]] famously said in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market. This is because it is by exchange that each person can be specialized in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.1956.tb02717.x | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGY: SPECIALIZATION AND SPECIATION | year=1956 | journal=Kyklos | pages=181\u2013189 | last1 = Houthakker | first1 = H.

Hence, a [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] approach to work design contributed to worsened industrial relations.\n\nThere are also limitations to the division of labour (and the division of work) that result from work-flow variations and uncertainties.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1628/093245613X13620416111326 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=The Division of Labour under Uncertainty | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE | pages=253\u2013274 | last1 = Wadeson | first1 = Nigel}}</ref><ref>[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12274210], Barrera, Catherine Grace (2014). Skill, Job Design, and the Labor Market under Uncertainty. ''Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University''</ref> These help to explain issues in modern work organization, such as task consolidations in [[business process reengineering]] and the use of multi-skilled work teams. For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages, so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Note also that modern [[flexible manufacturing system]]s require both flexible machines and flexible workers.\n\nIn project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the [[project manager]] as project [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] and resulting resource bookings are based on [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialisation.\n\nThere are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015 | volume=161 | issue=3 | title=Activity consolidation to improve responsiveness | year=2005 | journal=European Journal of Operational Research | pages=683\u2013703 | last1 = Rummel | first1 = Jeffrey L. | last2 = Walter | first2 = Zhiping | last3 = Dewan | first3 = Rajiv | last4 = Seidmann | first4 = Abraham}}</ref> For example, having a single person deal with a customer query means that only that one person has to be familiarised with the customer\u2019s details. It is also likely to result in the query being handled faster due to the elimination of delays in passing the query between different people.\n\n== Gendered division of labour ==\n{{Main article|Gender role|Women's work|Sexual division of labour|Occupational segregation}}\nThe clearest exposition of the principles of sexual division of labour across the full range of human societies can be summarized by a large number of logically complementary implicational constraints of the following form: if women of childbearing ages in a given community tend to do X (e.g., preparing soil for [[planting]]) they will also do Y (e.g., the planting) while for men the logical reversal in this example would be that if men plant they will prepare the soil. \"Entailment Theory and Method: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Sexual Division of Labor\"<ref>[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/Entail77.pdf eclectic.ss.uci.edu]</ref> by White, Brudner and Burton (1977, public domain), using statistical [[entailment]] analysis, shows that tasks more frequently chosen by women in these order relations are those more convenient in relation to [[childrearing]]. This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in [[cooking]]) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but [[ethnographic]] examples are lacking.\n\n== Industrial organizational psychology ==\nJob satisfaction has been shown to improve as an employee is given the task of a specific job. Students who have received PhDs in a chosen field later report increased satisfaction compared to their previous jobs. This can be attributed to their high levels of specialization.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = L.

It was created for use in [[coal mine]]s, to reduce the danger of explosions due to the presence of [[methane]] and other flammable gases, called ''[[firedamp]]'' or ''[[Damp (mining)|minedamp]].''\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Safety lamp#Timeline of the development of the safety lamp|label 1=Timeline of the development of the safety lamp}}\nDavy's invention was preceded by that of [[William Reid Clanny]], an Irish doctor at [[Bishopwearmouth]], who had read a paper to the [[Royal Society]] in May 1813. The more cumbersome Clanny safety lamp was successfully tested at Herrington Mill, and he won medals, from the [[Royal Society of Arts]].<ref name=\"Knight\"/>\n\nDespite his lack of scientific knowledge, engine-wright [[George Stephenson]] devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass. A month before Davy presented his design to the Royal Society, Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down [[Killingworth#Killingworth Colliery|Killingworth Colliery]] and holding it in front of a fissure from which [[firedamp]] was issuing.\n\nThe first trial of a Davy lamp with a wire sieve was at [[Hebburn]] Colliery on 9 January 1816.<ref name=\"Thompson2004\"/> A letter from Davy (which he intended to be kept private) describing his findings and various suggestions for a safety lamp  was made public at a meeting in Newcastle on 3 November 1815,<ref name=\"Paris1831\">{{cite book|author=John Ayrton Paris|title=The Life of Sir Humphry Davy, Late President of the Royal Society, Foreign Associate of the Royal Institute of France ...: In 2 volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_g5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA88|year=1831|publisher=Colburn & Bentley}}</ref> and a paper describing the lamp was formally presented at a Royal Society meeting in London on 9 November.<ref name=\"Royal Society\"/> For it, Davy was awarded the Society's Rumford Medal.

He follows Smiles(1857) in referring to an incident in 1857 at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.}}\n\n== Design and theory ==\n[[File:Pieler safety lamp.jpg|thumb|upright|A type of Davy lamp with apertures for gauging flame height]]\n\nThe lamp consists of a [[Candle wick|wick]] lamp with the flame enclosed inside a mesh screen.  The screen acts as a [[flame arrestor]]; air (and any firedamp present) can pass through the mesh freely enough to support combustion, but the holes are too fine to allow a flame to propagate through them and ignite any firedamp outside the mesh. It originally burned a heavy vegetable oil.\n\nThe lamp also provided a test for the presence of gases. If flammable gas mixtures were present, the flame of the Davy lamp burned higher with a blue tinge.  Lamps were equipped with a metal gauge to measure the height of the flame. Miners could place the safety lamp close to the ground to detect gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], that are denser than air and so could collect in depressions in the mine; if the mine air was oxygen-poor ([[asphyxiant gas]]), the lamp flame would be extinguished (''[[black damp]]'' or ''chokedamp''). A methane-air flame is extinguished at about 17% oxygen content (which will still support life), so the lamp gave an early indication of an unhealthy atmosphere, allowing the miners to get out before they died of asphyxiation.\n\n== Impact ==\nIn 1816, the [[Cumberland Pacquet]] reported a demonstration of the Davy lamp at William Pit, Whitehaven. Placed in  a blower \"... the effect was grand beyond description. At first a blue flame was seen to cap the flame of the lamp, - then succeeded a lambent flame, playing in the cylinder; and shortly after, the flame of the firedamp expanded, so as to completely fill the wire gauze. For some time, the flame of the lamp was seen through that of the firedamp, which became ultimately extinguished without explosion. Results more satisfactory were not to be wished...\"<ref name=\"WilliamPit1816\">{{cite news|title=untitled paragraphs|work=Cumberland Pacquet, and Ware's Whitehaven Advertiser|page=3|date=9 April 1816}}</ref> Another correspondent to the paper commented \"The Lamp offers absolute security to the miner...

The coroner noted that a previous firedamp explosion in 1821 had killed 52, but directed his jury that any finding on the wisdom of continuing to work the seam was outside their province.<ref name=\"Sykes 1835\">{{cite book|last1=Sykes|first1=John|title=An account of the dreadful explosion in Wallsend Colliery, on the 18th June, 1835, to which is added a list of explosions, inundations, &c. which have occurred in the Coal Mines of Northumberland and Durham ...|date=1835|publisher=John Sykes|location=Newcastle|url=https://archive.org/details/b22485302}} (Sykes was the publisher of the [[Newcastle Courant]])</ref>\n\nThe lamps had to be provided by the miners themselves, not the owners, as traditionally the miners had bought their own candles from the company store. Miners still preferred the better illumination from a naked light, and mine regulations insisting that only safety lamps be used<ref name=\"wood1988\" />{{rp|139}} were draconian in principle, but in practice neither observed nor enforced. After two accidents in two years (1838-9) in Cumberland pits, both caused by safety checks being carried out by the light of a naked flame, the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842|Royal Commission on Children's Employment]] commented both on the failure to learn from the first accident, and on the 'further absurdity ' of 'carrying a Davy lamp in one hand for the sake of safety, and a naked lighted candle in the other, as if for the sake of danger. Beyond this there can be no conceivable thoughtlessness and folly; and when such management is allowed in the mine of two of the most opulent coal-proprietors in the kingdom, we cease to wonder at anything that may take place in mines worked by men equally without capital and science'<ref name=\"wood1988\" />{{rp|140}}\n\nAnother reason for the increase in accidents was the unreliability of the lamps themselves. The bare gauze was easily damaged, and once just a single wire broke or rusted away, the lamp became unsafe.\nWork carried out by a scientific witness and reported by the Select Committee showed that the Davy lamp became unsafe in airflows so low that a Davy lamp carried at normal walking pace against normal airflows in walkways was only safe if provided with a draught shield<ref name=\"mines1843\" />{{rp|13\u201317}} (not normally fitted), and the Committee noted that accidents had happened when the lamp was \"in general and careful use; no one survived to tell the tale of how these occurrences took place; conjecture supplied the want of positive knowledge most unsatisfactorily; but incidents are recorded which prove what must follow unreasonable testing of the lamp; and your Committee are constrained to believe that ignorance and a false reliance upon its merits, in cases attended with unwarrantable risks, have led to disastrous consequences\" <ref name=\"Smiles1857\" />{{rp|131}} The \"South Shields Committee\", a body set up by a public meeting there<ref>advertisement beginning {{cite news|title=At A Public Meeting of the Inhabitants...|work=Durham County Advertiser|date=5 July 1839|page=3}}</ref> (in response to an explosion at the St Hilda pit in 1839)<ref>{{cite news|title=Awful Loss of Life at South Shields|work=Newcastle Courant|date=5 July 1839|page=2}}</ref> to consider the prevention of accidents in mines  had shown that mine ventilation in the North-East was generally deficient, with an insufficient supply of fresh air giving every opportunity for explosive mixtures of gas to accumulate.<ref name=\"mines1843\">{{cite book|title=The Report of the South Shields Committee, appointed to investigate the causes of Accidents in Coal Mines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzUJAAAAQAAJ|year=1843|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, & Longmans|location=London}}</ref>{{rp|28\u201336}}{{efn| The Shields Committee argued that the local mines had had far too few shafts for the size of the underground workings (a view supported by evidence from George Stephenson, amongst others) and that the Commons Select Committee of 1835 had been misled on this point by gross over-estimates of the cost of additional shafts given them by [[John Buddle]]. The Shields Committee also argued against the practice (which it thought Parliament should legislate against for all new winnings) of sinking a single shaft and sub-dividing it by partitions ('brattices') to separate in- and out-flowing ventilation air - any explosion destroying the bratticing would destroy the ventilation of the mine and ensure the death by asphyxiation of those underground.  This scenario had led to some of the deaths in the Wallsend accident of 1835: multiple shafts became a legal requirement in 1863 after the death of 204 miners in the [[Hartley Colliery disaster]] of 1862 where the catastrophic failure of a pump beam both destroyed the ventilation and blocked the only means of escape.}}  A subsequent Select Committee in 1852 concurred with this view; firedamp explosions could best be prevented by improving mine ventilation (by the use of steam ejectors: the committee specifically advised against fan ventilation), which had been neglected because of over-reliance on the safety of the Davy lamp.<ref>{{cite book|title=Report from the Select Committee on Coal Mines, together with the Proceedings of the Committee, Minutes of Evidence, Appendix and Index|date=1852|publisher=by order of the House of Commons|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/reports18354918502grea}}</ref>{{rp|viii}}\n\nThe '''Regulation and Inspection of Mines Act''' of 1860 therefore required coal mines to have an adequate amount of ventilation, constantly produced, to dilute and render harmless noxious gases so that work areas were - under ordinary circumstances - in a fit state to be worked (areas where a normally safe atmosphere could not be ensured were to be fenced off \"as far as possible\"): it also required safety lamps to be examined and securely locked by a duly authorised person before use.\n\nEven when new and clean, illumination from the safety lamps was very poor, and the problem was not fully resolved until electric lamps became widely available in the late 19th century.\n\n== Successors ==\n\nA modern-day equivalent of the Davy lamp is the Protector Garforth GR6S<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.protectorlamp.com/gr6s-mines-approved-flame-safety-lamp-atex-m2/|title=GR6S Mines Approved Flame Safety Lamp, ATEX M2 - Protector Lamp|website=www.protectorlamp.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref> flame safety lamp which is the approved lamp for firedamp testing in all [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|UK coal mines]].

Travis Morgan & Partners were commissioned by the London Docklands Study Team to consider the issue. They proposed, among other recommendations, that a \"minitram\" people-mover system capable of carrying up to 20 people in each unit should be constructed to connect the Docklands with the planned Fleet line tube railway terminus at [[Fenchurch Street railway station]]. The [[Greater London Council]] formed a Docklands Joint Committee with the Boroughs of [[Greenwich]], [[Lewisham]], [[Newham]], [[Southwark]] and [[Tower Hamlets]] in 1974 to undertake the redevelopment of the area. A light railway system was envisaged, terminating either at [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill Underground station]] or at Fenchurch Street, but both options were seen as too expensive. Nonetheless, in 1976 another report proposed a conventional tube railway for the area and London Transport obtained Parliamentary powers to build a line from [[Charing Cross railway station]] to Fenchurch Street, Surrey Docks (now [[Surrey Quays railway station]]), the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[North Greenwich, Isle of Dogs|North Greenwich]] and Custom House to [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]]. This was intended to be the second stage of the Fleet line&nbsp;\u2013 which had been renamed the [[Jubilee line]], the first stage of which opened in 1979 from {{LUL stations|station=Stanmore}} to {{LUL stations|station=Charing Cross}}. However, when the Conservative Party came to power in May 1979 under [[Margaret Thatcher]], the plans to extend the Jubilee line were halted and the new government insisted that a lower-cost option should be pursued.<ref name=\"DLRhandbook-p4-5\">{{Cite book|title=Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook|last2=Hardy|first2=Brian|last3=Stannard|first3=Colin|date=November 2000|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|isbn=185414-223-2|location=Harrow Weald|pages=4\u20135|last1=Pearce|first1=Alan}}</ref>\n\nThe government created the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] (LDDC) in July 1981 to coordinate the redevelopment of the Docklands. The need to provide a cheap public transport solution led to it commissioning London Transport to evaluate a number of exclusively light rail options. The core of the route ran alongside the [[Great Eastern Main Line|Great Eastern line]] out of London and south along the former London & Blackwall Railway line through the Isle of Dogs. Three terminus options were proposed at the west end, at Tower Hill, Minories and Aldgate East. The Tower Hill option would have required a low-level interchange to be constructed alongside the existing Underground station, but this would have been a very costly venture. The Minories option, a high-level station virtually on the site of the old [[Minories railway station]], was selected and became the current Tower Gateway DLR terminus.<ref name=\"DLRhandbook-p4-5\" /> Aldgate East would have been perhaps the most ambitious of all of the options, as it originally envisaged a low-level connection with the [[District line]] that would have allowed DLR trains to run on Underground tracks to a variety of central London destinations. However, it quickly became apparent that there was no capacity on the existing network for integrating the DLR into the Underground.<ref name=\"DLRhandbook-p6\">Pearce, Hardy & Stannard, ''Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook'' (2000), p. 6</ref>\n\nTwo southern terminus options were put forward, at Cubitt Town (today's Island Gardens station) and Tiller Road, on the west side of Millwall Dock, with two possible routes to reach them. A \"western\" route would have run from the Westferry station alongside West Ferry Road via Cuba Street, then either terminating at Tiller Road or continuing over Millwall Docks Cut to a terminus at Cubitt Town. The \"central\" option required the West India Docks to be infilled or bridged and would run down the middle of the peninsula, through what was at the time an area of derelict warehouses.<ref name=\"DLRhandbook-p6\" /> Ultimately this latter option was chosen, though the 1981 London Transport report warned that without extensive development around Canary Wharf the area would be \"very isolated with poor traffic prospects\"&nbsp;\u2013 as indeed it was, for a number of years.<ref name=\"DLRhandbook-p7\">Pearce, Hardy & Stannard, ''Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook'' (2000), p. 7</ref>\n\nThe contract for the initial system was awarded to [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] [[Mowlem]] in 1984<ref name=\"20CentLondon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conInformationRecord.27 |title=Docklands Light Railway (D.L.R.) |publisher=Exploring 20th Century London |accessdate=3 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ZMSGS08?url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/docklands-light-railway-d-l-r |archivedate=20 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the system was constructed from 1985 to 1987 at a cost of \u00a377&nbsp;million.<ref name=ModernRailways3>[[Roger Ford|Ford, Roger]]. \"Opening of the Docklands Light Railway\".

It was mainly elevated on disused railway viaducts or new concrete viaducts, and adopted disused surface railway formations between Poplar and Stratford. The trains were fully automated, controlled by computer, and had no driver; a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) on each train, originally referred to as a \"Train Captain\", was responsible for patrolling the train, checking tickets, making announcements and controlling the doors.

Transmissions occur via an inductive loop cable between each train's Vehicle On-Board Controller ([[VOBC]]) and the control centre (VCC, SMC) at Beckton. If this link is broken and communication is lost between the [[VOBC]] and VCC, SMC, the train stops until it is authorised to move again.

The chimney takes its name from jute baron James Cox who later became [[List of Lord Provosts of Dundee|Provost]] of the city]]\n\nThe period following World War II was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. [[NCR Corporation]] selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<ref name=\"ncr\">{{harvnb|NCR Cash Advance}}</ref> primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on 11 June 1947. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant the 250,000th cash register was produced.\n\nBy the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city producing [[cash register]]s, and later [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATMs]], at several of its Dundee plants. The firm developed magnetic-strip readers for cash registers and produced early computers.<ref>{{harvnb|First Dundee computer next year}}</ref> Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold [[refrigerators]] and [[Clothes dryer|spin dryers]] was merged into [[Morphy Richards]] and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people.

To combat growing unemployment and declining economic conditions, Dundee was declared an [[Enterprise Zone]] in January 1984. In 1983, the first [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] [[home computers]] were produced in Dundee by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]]. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a [[sit-in]] by workers protesting against job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket.

''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' (1967\u20131968)\n}}\n\n'''''Do Not Adjust Your Set''''' ('''''DNAYS''''') was a television series produced originally by [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion, London]], then, by the fledgling [[Thames Television]] for British commercial television channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 26 December 1967 to 14 May 1969. The show took its name from the message (frequently seen on the TV screen in those days) which was displayed when there was a problem with transmission.\n\nIt included early appearances of [[Denise Coffey]], [[David Jason]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], and [[Michael Palin]]; the last three became members of the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe soon afterwards. Although originally conceived as a children's programme, it quickly acquired a following amongst many adults, including future Pythons [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]] (as mentioned by Cleese himself in the \"Paying my ex-wife\" stage performance tour, October 2010).\n\nSatirical comedy/art/pop group The [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] also performed a song or two in each programme and frequently appeared as extras in sketches. The programme itself comprised a series of frequently satirical sketches, often presented in a bizarre, surreal and disjointed style which anticipates ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which followed five months after the last episode of ''DNAYS''. Strange animations between sketches were crafted for the final episodes by the then-unknown [[Terry Gilliam]], who soon graduated to ''Python'' with Palin, Jones and Idle \u2013 part of Gilliam's \"Christmas cards\" animation reappeared there in the \"Joy to the World\" segment. \n\nOne long-running feature of the show was ''[[Captain Fantastic (TV series)|Captain Fantastic]]'', a [[superhero]] parody   featuring David Jason in improbable and even macabre adventures against [[villainess]] Mrs. Black (Coffey). These segments were shot entirely on film, on location in London. The feature was so popular with the young audience that after DNAYS itself ended Captain Fantastic briefly continued on its own terms. In 1968, the feature won the show an international award, the Prix Jeunesse, in Munich.\n\n==Episodes==\n*Episodes produced by [[Associated-Rediffusion]]:\n**The very first episode, an introductory special meant for Boxing Day 1967, was accidentally switched with the first regular episode in all regions except for London.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DNAYS.jpg|thumb|alt=Episodes for 26-12-1967 and 4-1-1968 were accidentally swapped on premiere.|The episodes for 26-12-1967 and 4-1-1968 were accidentally swapped on premiere.]] -->\n**Thirteen regular c.25 minute episodes (in a 30 minutes slot) broadcast between 26 December 1967 to 28 March 1968, Thursdays at 17:25.\n**Untitled special c.25 minutes broadcast 29 July 1968, Monday at 19:00.\n*Episodes produced by [[Thames]]:\n**\"Do not adjust your stocking\", 40 minutes broadcast 25 December 1968, Wednesday 16:10. For a 1986 repeat, David Jason demanded to be removed from the show, thus creating an abridged version of 25 minutes.\n**Series two: 13 episodes of c.25 minutes broadcast between 19 February 1969 to 14 May 1969, Wednesdays at 17:20.\n*In common with another important ''Monty Python'' predecessor, ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', many episodes were [[wiping|wiped]].\n\n==DVD release==\nNine of the 14 episodes from the first (Rediffusion) series were released on DVD in the UK and the US in August 2005. Both releases use the same [[NTSC]] Region 0 discs made from [[telerecording]]s of the original videotapes.\n\nThe episodes are renumbered 1 to 9, although, in fact they are episodes 1-2, 5-6, and 9-13 (a similar fault was made on the release of ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''). The sole surviving episode from series 2 and ''Do Not Adjust Your Stocking'' were not included.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011194036/http://www.btinternet.com/~m.brown1/dnays.htm Missing Episodes website]</ref> The 4th episode of the first series was only discovered afterwards - it survives because the show was entered for the Prix de Jeunesse award, so a copy was sent to the jury - and does not appear on the DVD either.<ref>[http://www.thiswaydown.org/missing-episodes/dnays.htm Missing Episodes website]</ref>\n\nThe packaging further implies that Gilliam's animations appear in these episodes, but they do not. Gilliam does appear as one of the additional writers in the credits for episodes three and four. The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band is seen playing its song \"[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]\" (also performed in [[The Beatles]]' film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'') in the DVD, Episode 7.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | title=A Concise History of British Television 1930\u20132000 | first=Tony | last=Currie | publisher=Kelly Publications | year=2004 | isbn=1-903053-17-X | page=64 }}\n* {{cite book | title=From Fringe to Flying Circus: Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy, 1960\u20131980 | first=Roger | last=Wilmut | publisher=Eyre Methuen | year=1980 | page=183 }}\n\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/515090/index.html British Film Institute Screen Online]\n*[http://www.popmatters.com/review/do-not-adjust-your-set/ A Review of DNAYS!]\n* {{IMDb title|0061247|Do Not Adjust Your Set}}\n* {{tv.com show|do-not-adjust-your-set|Do Not Adjust Your Set}}\n\n{{Monty Python}}\n<!--Need to check the full cast list-->\n\n[[Category:1967 British television programme debuts]]\n[[Category:1969 British television programme endings]]\n[[Category:1960s British comedy television series]]\n[[Category:ITV sketch shows]]\n[[Category:ITV comedy]]\n[[Category:Monty Python]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Associated-Rediffusion]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Thames Television]] \n[[Category:English-language television programs]]", "sha1": "eqt26ktx6j3yq486zm8eqj5p9edt162"}}, {"title": "West Memphis Three", "ns": "0", "id": "8832", "revision": {"id": "865937955", "parentid": "862589426", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T04:59:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gagwef", "id": "33365190"}, "comment": "ctrl+f", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|WM3}}\n{{redirect|Jason Baldwin|the former Australian rules footballer|Jason Baldwin (footballer)}}\n{{short description|three men convicted of the 1993 murders of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{pp-semi-blp|small=yes}}\n[[File:West Memphis Three Mugshot.jpg|thumb|300px|The West Memphis Three photographed after their arrest in June 1993 by the West Memphis Police Department]]\n\nThe '''West Memphis Three''' are three men who&nbsp;&ndash; while teenagers&nbsp;&ndash; were tried and convicted, in 1994, of the 1993 murders of three boys in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]].

Misskelley and Echols had dropped out of high school; however, Baldwin earned high grades and demonstrated a talent for drawing and sketching, and was encouraged by one of his teachers to study [[graphic design]] in college.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\"/> Echols and Baldwin were close friends, and bonded over their similar tastes in music and fiction, and over their shared distaste for the prevailing cultural climate of West Memphis, situated in the [[Bible Belt]]. Baldwin and Echols were acquainted with Misskelley from school, but were not close friends with him.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\"/>\n\nEchols' family was poor and received frequent visits from [[social work]]ers, and he rarely attended school. He and a girlfriend had run off and later broken into a trailer during a rain storm; they were arrested, though only Echols was charged with burglary.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\"/>\n\nEchols spent several months in a mental institution in Arkansas and afterward received \"full disability\" status from the [[Social Security Administration]].<ref name=\"Leveritt03\"/> During Echols' trial, Dr. George W.

Chris Morgan and Brian Holland, both with drug offense histories, had abruptly departed for [[Oceanside, California]], four days after the bodies were discovered.<ref name=\"Lp2728\"/> Morgan was presumed to be at least casually familiar with all three murdered boys, having previously driven an ice cream truck route in their neighborhood.\n\nArrested in Oceanside on May 17, 1993, Morgan and Holland both took [[polygraph]] exams administered by California police. Examiners reported that both men's charts indicated deception when they denied involvement in the murders. During subsequent questioning, Morgan claimed a long history of drug and alcohol use, along with blackouts and memory lapses. He claimed that he \"might have\" killed the victims but quickly recanted this part of his statement.<ref name=\"Lp2728\"/>\n\nCalifornia police sent blood and urine samples from Morgan and Holland to the WMPD, but there is no indication WMPD investigated Morgan or Holland as suspects following their arrest in California.

The man was bleeding and had brushed against the restroom walls. Officer Regina Meeks responded to the call, taking the restaurant manager's report through the eatery's [[Drive-through|drive-through window]]. By then, the man had left, and police did not enter the restroom on that date.<ref name=\"Leveritt6-174\">{{cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1760-7|pages=6, 174}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the victims' bodies were found, Bojangles' manager Marty King, thinking there was a possible connection to the bloody man found in the bathroom, reported the incident to police officers who then inspected the ladies' room. King gave the officers a pair of sunglasses he thought the man had left behind, and the detectives took some blood samples from the walls and tiles of the restroom. Police detective Bryn Ridge testified that he later lost those blood scrapings. A hair identified as belonging to a black male was later recovered from a sheet wrapped around one of the victims.<ref name=\"Leveritt6-174\"/>\n\n==Investigation==\n===Evidence and interviews===\nPolice officers James Sudbury and Steve Jones felt that the crime had \"cult\" overtones, and that Damien Echols might be a suspect because he had an interest in occultism, and Jones felt Echols was capable of murdering children.<ref name=Newton1/> The police interviewed Echols on May 7, two days after the bodies were discovered.<ref name=Newton1/> During a [[polygraph]] examination, he denied any involvement.

Nonetheless, they claimed he was not regarded as a direct suspect but a source of information.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" />\n\nOn June 3, the police interrogated Jessie Misskelley, Jr. Despite his reported [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 72 (categorizing him as [[borderline intellectual functioning]]) and his status as a [[minor (law)|minor]], Miskelley was questioned alone; his parents were not present during the interrogation.<ref name=\"CB\" /><ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Misskelley's father gave permission for Misskelley to go with police but did not explicitly give permission for his son to be questioned or interrogated.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Misskelley was questioned for roughly 12 hours.

Eight months after his original confession, on February 17, 1994, Misskelley made another statement to police.

Hutcheson's young son, Aaron, was also present, and proved such a distraction that Bray was unable to administer the polygraph. Aaron, a playmate of the murdered boys', mentioned to Bray that the boys had been killed at \"the playhouse.\" When the bodies proved to have been discovered near where Aaron indicated, Bray asked Aaron for further details, and Aaron claimed that he had witnessed the murders committed by Satanists who spoke Spanish. Aaron's further statements were wildly inconsistent, and he was unable to identify Baldwin, Echols, or Misskelley from photo line-ups, and there was no \"playhouse\" at the location Aaron indicated. A police officer leaked portions of Aaron's statements to the press contributing to the growing belief that the murders were part of a Satanic rite.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOn or about June 1, 1993, Hutcheson agreed to police suggestions to place hidden microphones in her home during an encounter with Echols. Misskelley agreed to introduce Hutcheson to Echols. During their conversation, Hutcheson reported that Echols made no incriminating statements. Police said the recording was \"inaudible\", but Hutcheson claimed the recording was audible. On June 2, 1993, Hutcheson told police that about two weeks after the murders were committed, she, Echols, and Misskelley attended a [[Wicca]]n meeting in [[Turrell, Arkansas]]. Hutcheson claimed that, at the Wiccan meeting, a drunken Echols openly bragged about killing the three boys. Misskelley was first questioned on June 3, 1993, a day after Hutcheson's purported confession. Hutcheson was unable to recall the Wiccan meeting location and did not name any other participants in the purported meeting. Hutcheson was never charged with theft. She claimed she had implicated Echols and Misskelley to avoid facing criminal charges, and to obtain a reward for the discovery of the murderers.<ref name=\"CB\"/>\n\n==Trials==\nMisskelley was tried separately, and Echols and Baldwin were tried together in 1994.

Echols testified that Detective Ridge's description of their earlier conversation (which was not recorded) regarding those particular details was inaccurate (and indeed that some other claims by Ridge were \"lies\"). Mara Leveritt, an investigative journalist and the author of ''[[Devil's Knot]]'', argues that Echols' information may have come from police leaks, such as Detective Gitchell's comments to Mark Byers, that circulated amongst the local public.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\"/><ref name = \"courttv\"/> The defense team objected when the prosecution attempted to question Echols about his past violent behaviors, but the defense objections were overruled.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1760-7|page=245}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Criticism of the investigation===\n[[File:Free the West Memphis Three.jpg|thumb|Protestors followed the trial]]\nThere has been widespread criticism of how the police handled the [[crime scene]].<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Misskelley's former attorney Dan Stidham cites multiple substantial police errors at the crime scene, characterizing it as \"literally trampled, especially the creek bed.\" The bodies, he said, had been removed from the water before the coroner arrived to examine the scene and determine the state of [[rigor mortis]], allowing the bodies to decay on the creek bank and to be exposed to sunlight and insects. The police did not telephone the coroner until almost two hours after the discovery of the floating shoe, resulting in a late appearance by the coroner. Officials failed to drain the creek in a timely manner and secure possible evidence in the water (the creek was sandbagged after the bodies were pulled from the water).\n\nMoreover, Stidham calls the coroner's investigation \"extremely substandard.\" There was a small amount of blood found at the scene that was never tested. According to HBO's documentaries ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]]'' (1996) and ''[[Paradise Lost 2: Revelations]]'' (2000), no blood was found at the crime scene, indicating that the location where the bodies were found was not necessarily the location where the murders actually happened. After the initial investigation, the police failed to control disclosure of information and speculation about the crime scene.<ref>{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003| publisher= Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |page=25 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Leveritt, \"Police records were a mess. To call them disorderly would be putting it mildly.\"<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Leveritt speculated that the small local police force was overwhelmed by the crime, which was unlike any they had ever investigated. Police refused an unsolicited offer of aid and consultation from the violent crimes experts of the [[Arkansas State Police]], and critics suggested this was due to the WMPD's being under investigation by the Arkansas State Police for suspected theft from the [[Crittenden County, Arkansas|Crittenden County]] drug task force.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Leveritt further noted that some of the physical evidence was stored in paper sacks obtained from a supermarket (with the supermarket's name printed on the bags) rather than in containers of known and controlled origin.\n\nWhen police speculated about the assailant, the juvenile probation officer assisting at the scene of the murders speculated that Echols was \"capable\" of committing the murders,\" stating: \"it looks like Damien Echols finally killed someone.\"<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" />\n\nBrent Turvey, a forensic scientist and criminal profiler, stated in the film ''Paradise Lost 2'' that human bite marks could have been left on at least one of the victims. However, these potential bite marks were first noticed in photographs years after the trials and were not inspected by a board-certified medical examiner until four years after the murders. The defense's expert testified that the mark in question was not an adult bite mark, while experts put on by the State concluded that there was no bite mark at all.<ref>{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003 | publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |pages=399, 404}}</ref> The State's experts had examined the actual bodies for any marks, and others conducted expert photo analysis of injuries.

The knife was a folding [[hunting knife]] manufactured by [[Kershaw Knives|Kershaw]]. According to the statements given by Berlinger and Sinofsky, Cooper informed them of his receipt of the knife on December 19, 1993. After the documentary crew returned to New York, Berlinger and Sinofsky were reported to have discovered what appeared to be blood on the knife. HBO executives ordered them to return the knife to the West Memphis Police Department. The knife was not received at the West Memphis Police Department until January 8, 1994.\n\nByers initially claimed the knife had never been used. However, after blood was found on the knife, Byers stated that he had used it only once, to cut deer meat. When told the blood matched both his and Chris' blood type, Byers said he had no idea how that blood might have gotten on the knife. During interrogation, West Memphis police suggested to Byers that he might have left the knife out accidentally, and Byers agreed with this.<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> Byers later stated that he may have cut his thumb. Further testing of the knife produced inconclusive results about the source of the blood. Uncertainty remained due to the small amount of blood<ref name=\"Leveritt03\" /> and because both John Mark Byers and Chris Byers had the same [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-DQ\u03b1 genotype.\n\nByers agreed to and passed a polygraph test about the murders during the filming of ''Paradise Lost 2: Revelations'', but the documentary indicated that Byers was under the influence of several [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive prescription]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] that could have affected the test results.\n\n===Possible teeth imprints (1996\u20131997)===\nFollowing their convictions, Echols, Misskelley, and Baldwin submitted imprints of their teeth. These were compared to the alleged bite marks on Stevie Branch's forehead that had not been mentioned in the original autopsy or trial.

His stated reasons for the removal are apparently contradictory.

Stidham overheard Judge Burnett discuss taking a lunch break with the jury foreman and heard the foreman reply that the jury was almost finished. He testified Judge Burnett responded, \"You'll need food for when you come back for sentencing,\" and that the foreman asked in return what would happen if the defendant was acquitted. Stidham said the judge closed the door without answering.

After losing his seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]], he served in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] again from [[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|1978]] until his death in 2000.<ref>Chambers Biographical Dictionary, 2007</ref> He served as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in [[Prime Minister (UK)|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from 1997 to 1999, successfully campaigning for a [[Scottish Parliament]] in the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 Scottish devolution referendum]].\n\nHaving led the Labour campaign in the run up to the first [[Scottish Parliament general election, 1999|Scottish Parliament election]], he subsequently became the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]] on 6 May 1999, and was appointed [[Scottish Labour Party#Organisation|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] a day later and became the first Scottish First Minister as the head of a devolved coalition government with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]].\n\nHe died of a [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]] while in office, and was succeeded as First Minister and Scottish Labour leader by [[Henry McLeish]].\n\n==Biography==\nDewar was born in [[Glasgow]] on 21 August 1937 as the only child of Alasdair (1897\u20131973) and Mary Dewar (n\u00e9e Bennett). His father was a [[dermatologist]] and a former general practitioner. Both Dewar's parents had ill health during his childhood; his father contracted [[tuberculosis]] and his mother suffered from a benign [[brain tumour]] when Donald was young.<ref>Allan 2000, para. 5</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Glasgow Academy]], and was admitted to the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1957, where he gained a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree in History in 1961, a second-class [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] degree in 1964, and was an editor of the ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]''.\n\nDewar met several future politicians at the university [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society|Dialectic Society]], including [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] (who would later become leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]), Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] (who would later become leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) and [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] (who would serve as [[Lord Chancellor]] in the same cabinet as Dewar). At university, he also served as chair of the [[Glasgow University Labour Club]] and president of the [[Glasgow University Union]].\n\nOn 20 July 1964, Dewar married Alison Mary McNair, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Marion, and a son, Ian. In 1972, McNair separated from Dewar and entered a relationship with the Scottish lawyer [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]]. Dewar and his wife divorced in 1973, and he never remarried.\n<ref name=\"dailymail1\">{{Cite news\n |title       = Ministers turn their backs on marriage.\n |url         = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109589012.html\n |publisher   = ''The Daily Mail''\n |date        = 15 January 2001\n |accessdate  = 2007-08-17\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516182859/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109589012.html\n |archivedate = 16 May 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Dewar and Irvine never reconciled, even though they later served in the same [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from May 1997 until 1999.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nHe worked as a [[solicitor]] in Glasgow after graduating from university, and was also a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and soon turned his sights towards being elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]. In 1962, he was selected as the Labour candidate for the [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] constituency. In the 1964 general election, he failed to win the seat, but won it at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]] at the age of 28\u2014defeating [[Priscilla Tweedsmuir]] by 1,799 votes.\n\nIn his maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the same year, Dewar spoke against a proposed increase on potato tax. His speech became his first political success: as the tax was repealed the following year in 1967. Also in 1967, Dewar was made a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]] [[Anthony Crosland]], with whom Dewar later confessed to having never establishing a rapport\u2014saying Crosland was a \"very odd man\".\n\nDewar remained in that position at the Department of Education until 1969, in which year Dewar opposed a visit to Aberdeen by the Springbok rugby team and staged a silent vigil near the team's ground. In April 1968, he was proposed for a [[Minister of State]] position by [[Roy Jenkins]], but was not appointed. Dewar lost his constituency seat to the Conservative candidate [[Iain Sproat]] at the 1970 general election by over 1,000 votes.\n\n===Out of parliament===\nDewar spent much of the 1970s looking for another parliamentary seat. He hosted a Friday evening talk show on [[Radio Clyde]], and in June 1971 was beaten by [[Dennis Canavan]] when he applied for the seat of [[West Stirlingshire]]. He worked as a [[solicitor]] for much of that decade and became a reporter on children's panels and was involved with the Lanarkshire local authority. Dewar became a partner in Ross Harper Murphy, in 1975.\n\nIn September 2009, Dennis Canavan said Dewar reacted callously when his son was diagnosed with [[skin cancer]] in 1989. The disease eventually killed him. Canavan said Dewar remarked, \"Oh no! That's all we need. He was mad enough before but I shudder to think what he'll be like now.\"<ref>''The Herald'' 2009</ref>\n\n===Return to Westminster===\nDonald Dewar was selected for the seat [[Glasgow Garscadden (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Garscadden]] by a majority of three, after Dewar's friend in the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers MP [[William Small (Scottish politician)|Willie Small]] died unexpectedly. He was returned to parliament at a [[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|by-election]] on 13 April 1978, a crucial victory which was seen as halting the rise of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In Scotland's first referendum on devolution, held in March 1979, he campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote alongside the Conservative [[Alick Buchanan-Smith (1932\u20131991)|Alick Buchanan-Smith]] and the Liberal [[Russell Johnston (politician)|Russell Johnston]]. Though they won a narrow majority, it fell short of the 40% required, contributing to the downfall of the Callaghan Government, in May 1979.\n\n===Opposition===\nDewar gained a parliamentary platform as chairman of the [[Scottish Affairs Select Committee]]. After a year honing his inquisitorial skills, he joined the front bench in November 1980 as a Scottish affairs spokesman when [[Michael Foot]] became party leader. In 1981, as the Labour Party divided itself further due to internal disagreement, Dewar was almost deselected in his constituency by hard left activists, but he successfully defended himself against this threat.\n\nHe rose quickly through the ranks, becoming Shadow Scottish Secretary in November 1983. On 21 December 1988, Dewar was in Lockerbie after the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]],<ref>The Scottish Government, 1998</ref> as the member of the Shadow Cabinet in charge of Scottish affairs. In 1992, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] made him Shadow [[Social security|Social Security]] Secretary and three years later, Dewar was made a Chief Whip for the Labour Party by [[Tony Blair]].\n\n===In government===\nAt the 1997 general election, he became MP for [[Glasgow Anniesland (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], which was mostly the same constituency with minor boundary changes. Labour won this election by a landslide, and Dewar was given the post of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. He was able to start the devolution process he dreamt of years earlier, and worked tirelessly on creating the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], popularly referred to as \"Smith's unfinished business\". When ratified, this was to give Scotland its first [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] for nearly 300 years.\n\n===First Minister of Scotland===\n\n{{Quote box|quote='There shall be a Scottish parliament.'

Although Scottish Labour won more seats than any other party, they did not have a majority in Parliament to allow them to form an Executive without the help of a smaller party. A deal was agreed with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] to form a coalition, with Dewar agreeing to their demand for the abolition of up front tuition fees for university students.<ref>''The Guardian'', 1999</ref>\n\nOn 13 May 1999, Dewar was nominated as First Minister, and was officially appointed by the Queen on 17 May at a ceremony in the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. He later travelled to the [[Court of Session]] to be sworn in by the Lord President and receive the [[Great Seal of Scotland]].<ref>''BBC News'', 1999a</ref>\n\nOn 16 June, Dewar set out the legislative programme for the Executive which included: an Education bill to improve standards in Scottish schools; land reform to give right of access to the countryside, a bill to abolish the feudal system of land tenure; and a bill to establish [[National Parks]] in Scotland.<ref>''BBC News'', 1999b</ref>\n\n===Death and funeral===\n[[File:Wfm donald dewar statue.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 2002, a {{convert|9|ft|spell=in|adj=on}} bronze statue of Dewar was erected outside Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall in a ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, and other Scottish politicians.<ref>''BBC News'' 2002</ref>]]\nIn April 2000, Dewar was admitted to hospital for tests on his heart, following a previous test where a minor irregularity was discovered.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000a</ref> In May 2000, he had surgery to repair a leaking heart valve, and was forced to take a three-month break from Parliament, with [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] taking over as Acting First Minister.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000b</ref> He returned to work on 14 August 2000.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000c</ref>\n\nDewar dealt with the [[SQA examinations  controversy|2000 exam results fiasco]] and the lorry drivers' strike, and attended the Labour Party conference in Brighton, but at the end of September he told the historian Tom Devine in [[Dublin]] that if there was no surge of the energy of old, he would have to reappraise the situation within a few months.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/donald_dewar.htm \"Donald Dewar\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513102041/http://www.electricscotland.com/history/donald_dewar.htm |date=13 May 2012 }}, ''Electronic Scotland'', October 2000''</ref>\n\nOn 10 October 2000 around lunchtime, Dewar sustained a fall.

In keeping with his famous unkempt appearance, it showed Dewar wearing a slightly crushed jacket.\n\nThe statue was taken down in October 2005 to be cleaned, and was re-erected on {{convert|6|ft|m|sing=on}} high plinth in December in an effort to protect it from vandalism. On the base of the statue were inscribed the opening words of the Scotland Act: \"There Shall Be A Scottish Parliament\", a phrase to which Dewar himself famously said, \"I like that!\"\n\nDewar called the [[New Parliament House, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] on [[Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]] a \"[[Scottish nationalist|nationalist]] [[shibboleth]]\", mainly because it had been the proposed site of the [[Scottish Assembly]] in the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1979|1979 referendum]]. Dewar's opposition to the Calton Hill site partly contributed to the selection of the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] site, [[Scottish Parliament Building#Problems|which proved expensive]].\n\nThe First ScotRail [[British Rail Class 334|Class 334]] train ''334001'' was named ''Donald Dewar'' in his memory. The \"Dewar Arts Award\" was created by the Scottish Executive in 2002 dedicated to his memory.

The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a \"[[Virtual world|Digital World]]\", a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various communication networks. In many incarnations, Digimon are raised by humans called \"Digidestined\" or \"Tamers\" (\"Chosen Children\" in the Japanese version), and they team up to defeat evil Digimon and human villains who are trying to destroy the fabric of the Digital world.\n\nThe franchise was first created in 1997 as a [[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|series of virtual pets]], akin to\u2014and influenced in style by\u2014the contemporary [[Tamagotchi]] or nano [[Giga Pet]] toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American [[comics]]. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', and an early video game, ''[[Digimon World]]'', both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and [[List of Digimon video games|the video game series]] has expanded into genres such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[racing game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]].

They age via a process called \"Digivolution\" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as ''Ultimate'' and ''Mega'' in the dub. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as ''Ultra'' in the dub.\n\nThe first Digimon anime introduced the Digimon [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]: They age in a similar fashion to real organisms, but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data, which can be seen throughout the show. Any Digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into [[infinitesimal]] bits of data. The data then recomposes itself as a Digi-Egg, which will hatch when rubbed gently, and the Digimon goes through its life cycle again. Digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life. However, if a Digimon's data is completely destroyed, they will die. An exception is partner Digimon, as whilst they can be reborn as many times as needed during their life span, should their partner die - the Digimon permanently dies as well. This is shown with Yukio Oikawa and Datirimon in ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''.<ref>https://withthewill.net/threads/19785-Digimon-Staff-Q-and-A-Livestream</ref>\n\n==Virtual pet toy==\n{{Main|Digital Monster (virtual pet)}}\nDigimon started out as [[digital pet]]s called \"[[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|Digital Monsters]]\", similar in style and concept to the [[Tamagotchi]]. It was planned by WiZ and released by [[Bandai]] on June 26, 1997<!--The earliest sources point to this as the date of release in Japan-->. The toy began as the simple concept of a [[Tamagotchi]] mainly for boys. The V-Pet is similar to its predecessors, with the exceptions of being more difficult and being able to fight other Digimon v-pets. Every owner would start with a Baby Digimon, train it, evolve it, take care of it, and then have battles with other Digimon owners to see who was stronger. The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had different Digimon. In December, the second generation of Digital Monster was released, followed by a third edition in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title = What Is Digimon?|accessdate = September 5, 2006|url = http://shiningevo.ultmatedigimon.com/wit.php|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100406051735/http://shiningevo.ultmatedigimon.com/wit.php|dead-url = yes|archive-date = April 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Anime==\n{{See also|List of Digimon episodes and movies}}\n\n===Television series===\n\nOn March 6, 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made. On March 7, 1999, they began airing a television sequel titled ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''.\n\nSix more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies, and the series was dubbed for release in western markets in the fall of the same year. The show spawned card games, with ''Hyper Colosseum'' in Japan and later ''Digi-Battle'' in America, and more video games. The animated series is easily the best-known segment of the Digimon universe and responsible for the majority of its popularity.\n\n\"Digimon\" are \"[[Digital data|Digital]] [[Monster]]s\". According to the stories, they are inhabitants of the \"[[List of Digimon locations|DigiWorld]]\", a manifestation of Earth's communication network. The stories tell of a group of mostly pre-[[teen]]s, who accompany special Digimon born to defend their world (and ours) from various evil forces. To help them surmount the most difficult obstacles found within both realms, the Digimon have the ability to evolve ''([[Digivolution|Digivolve]])''<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/digimon-digital-monsters/ |title=Digimon: Digital Monsters |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/tv/cover-story-masters-of-the-universe-youth-division.html | work=The New York Times | first=Laurel | last=Graeber | title=COVER STORY; Masters of the Universe, Youth Division | date=August 29, 1999}}</ref> In this process, the Digimon change appearance and become much stronger,<ref name=\"clements2006\">{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|author2=McCarthy, Helen}}</ref> often changing in personality as well. The group of [[child]]ren who come in contact with the Digital World changes from series to series.\n\nAs of 2016, there have been seven series&nbsp;\u2013 ''Digimon Adventure'', the follow-up sequel ''Digimon Adventure 02'', ''Digimon Tamers'', ''Digimon Frontier'', ''Digimon Data Squad'', ''Digimon Fusion'' and ''Digimon Universe: App Monsters''. The first two series take place in the same fictional universe, but the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh each occupy their own unique world. Each series is commonly based on the original storyline but things are added to make them unique. However, in ''Tamers'', the ''Adventure'' universe is referred to as a commercial enterprise&nbsp;\u2013 a trading card game in Japan, plus a show-within-a-show in the English dub. It also features an appearance by [[Ryo Akiyama|a character from the ''Adventure'' universe.]] In addition, each series has spawned assorted feature films. Digimon still shows popularity, as new card series, video games, and movies are still being produced and released: new card series include Eternal Courage, Hybrid Warriors, Generations, and Operation X; the video game, ''[[Digimon Rumble Arena 2]]''; and the previously unreleased movies ''[[Digimon Adventure 02#Revenge of Diaboromon|Revenge of Diaboromon]]'', ''[[Digimon Tamers#Runaway Locomon|Runaway Locomon]]'', ''[[Minami Uehara|Battle of Adventurers]]'', and ''[[Island of Lost Digimon]]''. In Japan, ''[[Digital Monster X-Evolution]]'', the eighth TV movie, was released on January 3, 2005, and on December 23, 2005 at [[Jump Festa]] 2006, the fifth series, ''[[Digimon Data Squad|Digimon Savers]]'' was announced for Japan to begin airing after a three-year [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] of the show. A sixth television series, ''[[Digimon Fusion|Digimon Xros Wars]]'', began airing in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/digimon-tv-anime-listed |title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime Listed |publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> and was followed by a second season, which started on October 2, 2011 as a direct sequel to ''Digimon Xros Wars''.\n\nIn August 2014, it was announced that a new Digimon Series will start airing in 2015. Celebrating the 15 years of the first series, it will be set in the ''Digimon Adventure'' universe, following a 17-year-old Tai and his friends in an all new story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-01/digimon-adventure-anime-returns-next-spring-in-high-school-sequel/.77195 |title=Digimon Adventure Anime Returns Next Spring in High School Sequel |publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> Titled ''[[Digimon Adventure tri.]]'', the new project was confirmed to be a series of six films, which started release in November 2015.\n\n''Digimon'' was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. The series were broadcast in Japan by [[Fuji Television]], except for ''Xros Wars'' and ''App Monsters'', which instead aired on [[TV Asahi]] and [[TV Tokyo]]. The first four series were called ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' in international markets, while ''Savers'' was released as ''Digimon Data Squad'' and ''Xros Wars'' has been released as ''Digimon Fusion''.\n\n====''Digimon Adventure''====\n{{Main|Digimon Adventure}}\nThe first Digimon television series, which began airing on March 7, 1999 in Japan on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and [[Kids Station]] and on August 14, 1999 in the United States on [[Fox Kids]] dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] for the North American English version. Its premise is a group of seven kids who, while at summer camp, travel to the Digital World,<ref name=\"clements2006\"/> inhabited by creatures known as Digital Monsters, or Digimon, learning they are chosen to be \"[[DigiDestined]]\" (\"Chosen Children\" in the Japanese version) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil. Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a [[Chosen Digimon|Digimon Partner]], such as Tai being paired up with [[Agumon]] and Matt with [[Gabumon]]. The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai, who helps them via hologram. The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril. The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms. Later, each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person; Tai the Crest of Courage, Matt the Crest of Friendship, Sora the Crest of Love, Izzy the Crest of Knowledge, Mimi the Crest of Sincerity, Joe the Crest of Reliability, T.K. the Crest of Hope, and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their Digimon to digivolve into their Ultimate forms. The group consisted of seven original characters: [[Tai Kamiya|Taichi \"Tai\" Yagami \"Kamiya\"]], [[Yamato \"Matt\" Ishida]], [[Sora Takenouchi]], [[Koushiro \"Izzy\" Izumi]], [[Mimi Tachikawa]], [[Joe Kido]], and [[Takeru \"T.K.\" Takaishi]]. Later on in the series, an eighth character was introduced: [[Hikari \"Kari\" Yagami \"Kamiya\"]] (who is Taichi's younger sister).<ref name=\"clements2006\"/>\n\n====''Digimon Adventure 02''====\n{{Main|Digimon Adventure 02}}\nThe second Digimon series is direct continuation of the first one, and began airing on April 2, 2000. Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Dark Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as [[Ken Ichijouji]] on Earth, only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires created by the evil Arukenimon start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken joins the DigiDestined, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner [[Wormmon]] revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including France and Australia from control spires and must fight and defeat the evil MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series. They stop the evil from destroying the two worlds, and at the end, every person on Earth gains their own Digimon partner.\n\n====''Digimon Tamers''====\n{{Main|Digimon Tamers}}\nThe third Digimon series, which began airing on April 1, 2001, is set largely in a \"real world\" where the ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02'' series are television shows, and where Digimon game merchandise (based on actual items) become key to providing power boosts to real Digimon which appear in that world. The plot revolves around three Tamers, [[Takato Matsuki]], [[Rika Nonaka]], and [[Henry Wong]]. It began with Takato creating his own Digimon partner by sliding a mysterious blue card through his card reader, which then became a [[Digivice|D-Power]]. [[Guilmon]] takes form from Takato's sketchings of a new Digimon. Together they bond with Rika, Henry, and Takato's friends Kenta, Kazu, and Jeri on a quest to rescue Calumon and defeat the evil force called the D-Reaper, who threatens to take over their world. (''Tamers''' only human connection to the ''Adventure'' series is [[Ryo Akiyama]], a character featured in some of the Digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the ''Adventure'' story-line.) Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve with the introduction of Biomerge-Digivolution and the way their \"Digivices\" work. In this series, the Tamers can slide game cards through their \"Digivices\" and give their Digimon partners certain advantages, as in the card game. This act is called \"Digi-Modify\" (Card Slash in the Japanese version). The same process was often used to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual, emotions play a big part in the digivolving process. Unlike the two seasons before it and most of the seasons that followed, ''Digimon Tamers'' takes a darker and more realistic approach to its story featuring Digimon who do not reincarnate after their deaths and more complex character development in the original Japanese. The anime has become controversial over the decade, with debates about how appropriate this show actually is for its \"target\" audience, especially due to the [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian nature]] of the last arc. The English dub is more lighthearted dialogue-wise, though still not as much as previous series.\n\n====''Digimon Frontier''====\n{{Main|Digimon Frontier}}\nThe fourth Digimon series, which began airing on April 7, 2002, radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution, Spirit Evolution, in which the human characters use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to transform themselves into special Digimon called Legendary Warriors, detracting from the customary formula of having digital partners. After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon (one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and [[Cherubimon]]) Takuya Kanbara, Koji Minamoto, Junpei Shibayama, Zoe Orimoto, Tommy Himi, and Koichi Kimura<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeadmirers.com/dfpages/dfstory1.html |title=Digimon Frontier Story and Characters |publisher=Animeadmirers.com |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World.\n\nSummoned by Ophanimon, the Digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of Cherubimon from physically destroying the Digital World. After finding the ten spirits of the Legendary Warriors and defeating Mercurymon, Grumblemon, Ranamon, and Arbormon, they finally end up fighting Cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. After the defeat of Cherubimon, the Digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the Royal Knights&nbsp;\u2013 Dynasmon and Crusadermon&nbsp;\u2013 from destroying the Digital World and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical Lucemon. Ultimately the Digidestined fail in preventing Lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the Real World. In the final battle, all of the legendary spirits the digidestined have collected thus far merge and create Susanoomon. With this new form, the digidestined are able to effectively defeat Lucemon and save the Digital World. In general, ''Frontier'' has a much lighter tone than that of ''Tamers'', yet remains darker than ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02''.\n\n====''Digimon Savers'' (''Digimon Data Squad'')====\n{{Main|Digimon Data Squad}}\nAfter a three-year hiatus, a fifth Digimon series began airing on April 2, 2006. Like ''Frontier'', ''Savers'' has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth.\n\nLater the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by a wicked scientist named Akihiro Kurata,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shiningevo.ultimatedigimon.com/scharacters.php |title=Digimon: The Shining Evolution |publisher=Shiningevo.ultimatedigimon.com |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains and permanently delete them, along with several opponents the D.A.T.S. must face, like the demonic Belphemon, and the tyrannical King Drasil who threaten to destroy both worlds. The English version was dubbed by [[Studiopolis]] and it premiered on the [[Jetix]] block on [[Toon Disney]] on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in ''Data Squad'' requires the human partner's DNA (\"Digital Natural Ability\" in the English version and \"Digisoul\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon, and a will to succeed. ''Digimon Savers'' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take).\n\nLike previously in ''Tamers'', this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub.\n\nWell Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada.\n\n====''Digimon Xros Wars'' (''Digimon Fusion'')====\n{{Main|Digimon Fusion}}\nThree and a quarter years after the end of the fifth series, a new sixth series was confirmed by [[Bandai]] for the Digimon anime, its official name of the series revealed in the June issue of Shueisha's V Jump magazine being ''Digimon Xros Wars''. It began airing in Japan on TV Asahi from July 6, 2010 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/Digimon-tv-anime-listed|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon Anime TV Listed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-02|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-05/new-digital-monsters/Digimon-tv-anime-image-posted|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime's Image Posted|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref> Reverting to the design style of the first four series as well as the plot taking on the younger, lighter tone present in series one, two, and four throughout the story. The story follows a boy named Mikey Kud\u014d (Taiki Kudo in Japan) who, along with his friends, ends up in the Digital World where they meet Shoutmon and his Digimon friends. Wielding a Digivice known as a Fusion Loader (Xros Loader in Japan), Mikey is able to combine multiple Digimon into one to enhance his power, Shoutmon being the usual core of the combination, using a technique known as \"DigiFuse\" (\"Digi-Xros\" in Japan).\n\nForming Team Fusion Fighters (Team Xros Heart in Japan), Mikey, Shoutmon and their friends travel through the Digital World to liberate it from the evil Bagra Army, led by Bagramon (Lord Bagra in English), and Midnight, a shady group led by AxeKnightmon with Nene as a figurehead before joining the Fusion Fighters. The Fusion Fighters also finds themselves at odds with Blue Flare, led by Christopher Aonuma (Kiriha Anouma in Japan).\n\nThe second arc of ''Xros Wars'' was subtitled ''The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms''. It saw the main cast reshuffled with a new wardrobe while Angie (Akari in Japan) and Jeremy (Zenjiro in Japan) stay behind in the Human World; thus making Mikey, Christopher and Nene the lead protagonists as they set off to face the Seven Death Generals of the Bagra Army and AxeKnightmon's new pawn: Nene's brother Ewan (Yuu in Japan). A new evolution known as Super Digivolution was introduced at the end of the first arc. The English dub of the series began airing on [[Nickelodeon]] on September 7, 2013, which is produced by [[Saban Brands]].\n\nOn August 17, 2011, [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[V-Jump]]'' magazine announced a sequel set one year later, a third arc of ''Xros Wars'' subtitled ''The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time'', which aired from October 2, 2011 to March 25, 2012, following on from the previous arc. It focuses on a new protagonist, Tagiru Akashi and his partner Gumdramon who embark on a new journey with an older Mikey, Shoutmon, an older Ewan and the revived Damemon, along with other new comrades as they deal with a hidden dimension that lies between the Human World and the Digital World called DigiQuartz, and a new evil force known as Quartzmon. The series finale reintroduces the heroes of the previous five seasons as they all come together and help the current heroes in the final battle due to the fact that the DigiQuartz is essentially a tear in Space and Time, allowing all of the Digimon universes to converge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-08-17/digimon-xros-wars-anime-to-get-2nd-year-this-october |title=Digimon Xros Wars Anime to Get 2nd Year This October - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n''Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time'' was a nominee for the 2012 [[International Emmy Kids Awards]] for \"Best Animation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iemmys.tv/news_item.aspx?id=155 |title=News - News - Item Detail - International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |publisher=Iemmys.tv |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n====''Digimon Adventure tri.''====\n{{Main|Digimon Adventure tri.}}\nA new Digimon series was announced thirty months after the end of ''Digimon Fusion'' at a 15th anniversary concert and theater event for the franchise in August 2014.

It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcast through [[Fox Kids]]. The first four series were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''. Some scenes from the original version were omitted from the Saban dub, or were modified, in order to comply with Fox's [[standards and practices]] which considered several scenes to be inappropriate for the target age group. Often dialogue was changed, and the show became less \"serious\" in tone compared to the Japanese version, instead featuring more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score (usually orchestral music, including music recycled from Saban's ''[[Masked Rider (TV series)|Masked Rider]]'') and completely different sound effects, due to licensing issues. Another noticeable change in the dub is in some cases, using different voice actors for different forms of a certain Digimon or in other cases, the actors adopting different voices for different forms, whereas in Japan, the voice actor for the most part merely changes the tone of his/her voice slightly, sometimes being altered for effect (this is especially the case in Season 1). As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw ''Digi-Bowl'' specials co-produced with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]; ''NFL on Fox'' commentator [[Terry Bradshaw]] provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.\n\n:After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during the third series, the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]]. This was due to a deal between Disney and UPN that had various Disney cartoons airing in lieu of UPN programming it themselves (at first under the name ''[[Disney's One Too]]'') which concluded the season ''Frontier'' aired. ''Frontier'' aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and [[Toon Disney]] (for the latter under the [[Jetix]] branding) for several years after. ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor [[Disney XD]]. Disney eventually lost the license to Digimon. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Xros Wars]]''. [[Funimation Entertainment]] has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''.\n\n:In September 2012, [[Saban Brands]] announced it had re-acquired the ''Digimon'' franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Deborah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Brand|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/sep/25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal|date=September 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Franchise|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-franchise|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=AnimeNewsNetwork|date=September 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Brand|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=BSCKids|date=September 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234026/http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=}}</ref> {{citation needed span|text=In the U.S. [[insular area]] of [[Puerto Rico]], the show was redubbed in Spanish.|date=July 2014}} Saban would acquire the licence for ''[[Digimon Fusion|Digimon Xros Wars]]'', with an English version in the works.

The dubbed seasons of ''Fusion'' are currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n'''Canada'''\n:In Canada, the Saban-dubbed series were broadcast on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], but only the first 26 episodes of ''Digimon Fusion'' were shown. The dubbed version of ''Data Squad'', which was produced for the Disney-affiliated [[Jetix]], aired on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]]. In Quebec (where ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' aired on [[TQS]], and ''[[Digimon 02]]'' on [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon|T\u00c9L\u00c9TOON]]), the show was redubbed in French. A French version of ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' aired in France, but not in North America.\n\n'''United Kingdom'''\n:In the United Kingdom, the American dubbed version of Digimon is broadcast. ''Digimon'' first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s children's slot [[CITV]] from 2001-2002, which broadcast ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' and a small amount of ''Tamers'' airing during after school hours. The entirety of ''Tamers'' aired on cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] from 2002\u201304. ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' (the fourth series/season) never aired in the UK as the show's (then) provider ''Jetix'' placed the season on hold. From 2011, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on [[Kix!]] (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids's (2000\u201303) and Kix's (2010-) [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] Television ratings, ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' & ''Tamers'' (with ''Data Squad'' in last place) have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viewing Data Top 10s|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10?|publisher=BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board)|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by [[ITV Studios#ITV Studios Global Entertainment|ITV Studios Global Entertainment]], Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, [[CITV]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Michelle|title=ITV to broadcast Digimon Fusion anime in 2014|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2013101730346/itv-to-broadcast-digimon-fusion-anime-in-2014.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Jeremy|title=ITV licenses Digimon Fusion|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/10/18/itv-licenses-digimon-fusion/|publisher=Kidsscreen|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> The UK finally got a release of Frontier on October 29, 2018, over 16 years since it was originally supposed to air.<ref>https://mailchi.mp/30f437a59d09/aw-slate</ref>\n\n'''Other areas'''\n:Digimon has also aired in countries such as Australia, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, the Netherlands, Malaysia, South Africa and most of Latin America among others. After the overwhelming popularity of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' in India and Pakistan, [[Cartoon Network (India)|Cartoon Network]] started to air Digimon in 2004. Later, all 4 series were aired.\n\n:The Latin American and Brazilian versions of Digimon are licensed and dubbed completely uncensored and uncut from the original Japanese edition until [[Digimon Data Squad]]. The first four series were licensed by [[Cloverway Inc.]] (since 2000 to 2004), and aired on cable for [[Disney XD (Latin America)|Fox Kids]] (first four series) and later on [[Disney XD (Latin America)|Jetix]] (only first season) and [[Disney XD (Latin America)|Disney XD]] (only fourth and fifth seasons). From 2005, the Digimon franchise licenses were taken over by [[Toei Animation Inc.]]. In 2009, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' was licensed by Toei Animation Inc.  and aired on cable for [[Disney XD (Latin America)|Disney XD]] since 2010 to 2014. The current season; ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' (Saban's version) aired on [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]] in 2014.\n\n:The show also aired in the Philippines in the middle of 2000 on [[ABS-CBN]]. It would air Friday nights at 7:30 p.m. ABS-CBN hired Filipino voice actors to dub the show in English. The dubbing, in most cases, was similar to the original Japanese version of the show, which was the medium for the dub except the fact that some of the voices sounded like the U.S. version (e.g., Taichi having an adolescent's voice instead of a kid's) or completely original to the dubbing crew (e.g., Gabumon's deep, grumbly voice). The entire first series of ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' was dubbed in English (in order to compete with the [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids]] version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' which aired on the rival network [[GMA 7]] on the same day and time), along with ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''. The second series aired on a new Saturday morning block at 10 a.m.. two weeks after the first series finale. This series was dubbed in both English and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], so that it would be compatible with the other shows in the block. [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] began airing ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' around 2003, then ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' late in 2004. This time, the show, along with some of the other [[anime]] that aired with it, was dubbed by [[Singapore]]an voice actors. Tamers and Frontier were dubbed in Filipino when both series aired on ABS-CBN on its weekday morning line-up of animated shows (Tamers first followed by Frontier after a few months). ''[[Digimon Savers]]'' began airing in the country on September 8, 2008 and has currently ended. However, in January 2008, [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] started to broadcast the Digimon series in Filipino with different voices with [[Digimon Adventure]]. The series which is currently shown on Hero is a rerun of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' (July 2015)\n\n:In the Czech Republic, Digimon aired after the success of Pok\u00e9mon by the [[TV Nova (Czech Republic)|TV Nova]] but it never got that popular. The first season was taken from America, it had the same dialogues and the soundtrack was just translated (instead of \"Digimon, digital monsters, digimon are the champions\" it was \"Digimon, digit\u00e1ln\u00ed monstra, digimon\u00edch str\u00e1\u017ec\u016f \u0161ampion\" and so on). The second season, however, was translated from Japanese version (although to keep the continuity with the first season the English dubbed names of the characters were used). Digimon Tamers along with Digimon Frontier got there many years later and it aired by Czech version of [[Animax Eastern Europe|Animax]].\n\n:In Sweden, only the first two seasons were dubbed into [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and aired on Swedish channel [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] (2001 to 2003) (Reruns were shown on the Swedish version of [[Fox Kids]] and [[Jetix]] (from 2002 to 2006), it was a straight dub from the North American English version. After the second season was over, the third season was neither dubbed nor aired on Swedish TV. Digimon could not compete against Pok\u00e9mon in Sweden. The first three movies were cut and merged into a movie. The fourth movie \"Diaboromon Strikes Back\" was never released in Sweden.\n\n:In The Europe was airing on [[Fox Kids]] (excluding Italy, Finland and Others)\n\n:In Serbia, as in Sweden, only two seasons were dubbed into Serbian language and aired in two separate dubs. Very first season was dubbed by [[Radio Television Belgrade]] and aired on [[RTS1]] in 2001. In 2007, the first season was dubbed again, but this time by Mirius studio and aired on [[RTV Pink]]. The second season launched on RTV Pink, also in 2007 but later took place on Pink Kids in 2008. Third and fourth seasons were planned, but the project pulled out.\n\n:In Italy, it aired on [[Rai 2]] since September 4, 2000.\n\n:In Spain, it aired on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] (only the first season), [[TVE1]], [[TVE2]], [[Fox Kids]], [[Jetix]], [[Disney XD]], [[Clan TVE]], [[Boing (Spain)|Boing]] and [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n (pay television)|FDF]].\n\n:In Croatia, it aired on [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]] and later on [[Disney XD]].\n\n:In Germany, it aired on [[RTL II]] and on [[Fox Kids]] and [[Tele 5]].\n\n:In Slovenia, it aired on [[Radiotelevizija Slovenija]].\n\n:In Poland, it aired on [[Fox Kids]] and later on [[ZigZap]].\n\n:In Bulgaria, it aired on the Channel [[Fox Kids]].\n\n:In Ukraine, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' was airing on [[Novyi Kanal]] from 2002 to 2004 (3 times) and ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' aired on [[TET (TV channel)]] in 2008.\n\n==Manga==\nDigimon first appeared in [[narrative]] form in the [[One shot (comic)|one-shot]] manga \u201c[[C'mon Digimon]],\u201d released in the summer of 1997. C'mon Digimon spawned the popular ''[[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]]'' manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.\n\n===Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01===\n{{Main|Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01}}\n\n===Digimon Chronicle===\n{{Main|Digimon Chronicle}}\n\n===Digimon Next===\n{{Main|Digimon Next}}\n\n===Digimon Xros Wars===\n{{Main|Digimon Xros Wars (manga)}}\n\n===Digimon World Re:Digitize===\n{{Main|Digimon World Re:Digitize}}\n\n===Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode===\n{{Main|Digimon World Re:Digitize}}\n\n===Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth===\n{{Main|Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth}}\n\n===Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory===\n{{Main|Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory}}\n\n===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===\nA Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (\u4f59 \u9060\u9360 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series.

The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime.\n\nThe Cantonese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in Hong Kong.\n\nTwo English versions were also released.

While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.\n\n==Video games==\n{{main|List of Digimon video games}}\n\n[[File:DigimonWorld2Battle.JPG|thumb|left|The player battles with three Digimon: Rosemon, [[List of Digimon Adventure characters#Agumon|WarGreymon]], and [[Agumon|SkullGreymon]].

After serving in the [[Mahdist War]] and then the response to the [[Boxer Rebellion]], he commanded the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Sir John Jellicoe]]. He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that \"There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today\", after two of his ships exploded. Later in the war he succeeded Jellicoe as Commander in Chief of the [[Grand Fleet]], in which capacity he received the surrender of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] at the end of the war. He then followed Jellicoe's path a second time, serving as [[First Sea Lord]]\u2014a position that Beatty held longer (7 years 9 months) than any other First Sea Lord in history.  While First Sea Lord, he was involved in negotiating the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan should set their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller ratio fleets of 1.75 each.\n\n==Family and childhood==\nBeatty was born into an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] family at Howbeck Lodge in the parish of [[Stapeley]], near [[Nantwich]], Cheshire, on 17 January 1871.<ref>Roskill, p. 20</ref> He was the second son of five children born to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] David Longfield Beatty and Katherine (or Katrine) Edith Beatty (n\u00e9e Sadleir), both from Ireland: David Longfield had been an officer in the [[4th Queen's Own Hussars|Fourth Hussars]] where he formed a relationship with Katrine, the wife of another officer.<ref name=heath23>Heathcote, p. 23</ref>\n\nKatrine had fair hair and blue eyes, soft wide lips, and overall an air of command. Beatty's father was {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}} tall, dark haired with big hands and feet. Both David and his elder brother Charles were short, about {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}} with small hands and feet. Charles was fair haired taking after his mother's features, whereas David had more the look of his father. After the affair between David Longfield and Katrine became known, David Longfield's father (Beatty's grandfather), David Vandeleur Beatty (1815\u20131881), arranged for his son to be posted to India in the hope that the scandalous relationship might end. David Longfield resigned from the regiment on 21 November 1865, with the honorary rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]. He took up residence with Katrine in Cheshire and in 1869 [[sale of commissions|sold his commission]].<ref>Beatty (1980), p.4-5</ref> David Longfield was unable to marry Katrine until Katrine had obtained a divorce on 21 February 1871, after the birth of their first two sons. Beatty's birth certificate recorded his mother's surname as Beatty, and his parents' eventual marriage at St Michael's Church in [[Liverpool]] was kept secret.<ref>Beatty (1980), p.1-3</ref>\n\nBeatty's early education concentrated on horsemanship, hunting and learning to be a gentleman. Beatty had a close relationship with his elder brother Charles, who became his ally against their oppressive and overbearing father. They remained close throughout life, so much so that the only time Beatty felt despair was at his brother's death. Beatty later wrote to his wife about Charles, ''we lived together, played together, rode together, fought together.''<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 20 citing letter to Beatty's wife</ref> His brothers would later join the [[British Army]], but early on young David developed an interest in ships and the sea and expressed a desire to join the [[Royal Navy]]. In 1881 Beatty's grandfather died and David Longfield succeeded to the 18th century mansion, '[[Borodale]]', outside [[Enniscorthy]], in [[County Wexford]]. After retiring from the army David Longfield established a business training horses first in Cheshire and then at 'The Mount', near [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], Warwickshire. On inheriting and following the death of his wife at 'The Mount', David Longfield returned to Ireland abandoning the training business.<ref>Beatty (1980), p.31</ref>\n\nBeatty was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and in 1882 entered [[Burney's Academy|Burney's Naval Academy]] at [[Gosport]], which was a 'crammer' for boys wishing to take the entrance examinations for the Royal Navy.<ref>Beatty (1980), p.11</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Rear Admiral David Beatty pre-1915.jpg|thumb|right|Captain David Beatty]]\nBeatty joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[cadet]] passing into the training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] tenth out of ninety-nine candidates in January 1884.<ref name=Beatty21>Roskill, p. 21</ref> During his two years at ''Britannia'', moored at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], he was beaten three times for various infractions. He passed out of ''Britannia'' eighteenth out of the thirty-three remaining cadets at the end of 1885.<ref name=Beatty21/> Beatty's letters home made no complaint about the poor living conditions in ''Britannia'', and generally he was extrovert, even aggressive, and resented discipline. However, he understood how far he could transgress without serious consequences, and this approach continued throughout his career.<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 11-12</ref>\n\nBeatty was given orders to join the [[China Station]] in January 1886, but the posting did not appeal to his mother, who wrote to [[Lord Charles Beresford]], then a senior naval officer, member of parliament and personal friend, to use his influence to obtain something better.<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 14</ref> Beatty was, in February 1886, instead appointed to [[HMS Alexandra (1875)|HMS ''Alexandra'']], flagship of Admiral the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Edinburgh]], Queen Victoria's second son, who was Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Squadron]].<ref>Roskill, p. 22</ref> This proved an excellent social opening for Beatty, who established a longstanding relationship with the Duke's eldest daughter, [[Marie of Edinburgh|Marie]], and with other members of the court. ''Alexandra'' was a three-masted sailing ship with auxiliary steam power, nonetheless, remaining flagship in a navy which was steadily transitioning from sail to steam. Life in the Mediterranean fleet was considerably easier than cadet life, with visits to friendly ports all around the Mediterranean, but Beatty was concerned to work diligently towards naval examinations, which would determine seniority and future promotion prospects.<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 15, 21</ref> Beatty was promoted to [[midshipman]] on 15 May 1886<ref name=heath23/> and assigned to assist Lieutenant [[Stanley Colville]] on watchkeeping duties: Colville was to play an important part in Beatty's future career.<ref>Chalmers, p. 12</ref>\n\nBeatty left HMS ''Alexandra'' in March 1889 and joined the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Warspite (1884)|HMS ''Warspite'']] in July 1889 for manoeuvres before joining the sailing corvette [[HMS Ruby (1876)|HMS ''Ruby'']] in September 1889, in which he was promoted to [[sub-lieutenant]] on 14 May 1890.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26253|page=544|date=2 February 1892}}</ref> Next he attended courses at the [[Royal Naval College (Greenwich)|Royal Naval College, Greenwich]] during which he was somewhat distracted from his naval career by the delights of London. Beatty scored a first-class examination pass in Torpedoes, but only seconds in Seamanship, Gunnery and Pilotage, and a third in Navigation. A biography states that \"his cabin at Greenwich was full of photographs of actresses, some of which were signed in the most endearing terms\".<ref>Roskill, p. 24 citing Shane Leslie draft biography of Beatty which was discontinued at the request of the family</ref> After attending the gunnery school, [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], he undertook a posting to a torpedo boat in July 1891 and then a tour in [[HMS Nile (1839)|HMS ''Nile'']] from 19 January 1892.<ref name=heath23/>\n\nBeatty joined the Royal Yacht ''Victoria and Albert'' in July 1892 while [[Queen Victoria]] was holidaying in the Mediterranean: Victoria was in mourning for her grandson, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Albert Duke of Clarence]], who had died January 1892.<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 22</ref> Promoted to lieutenant on 25 August 1892,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26322|page=5016|date=2 September 1892}}</ref> he rejoined HMS ''Ruby'' in August 1892 and then transferred to the battleship [[HMS Camperdown (1885)|HMS ''Camperdown'']] in September 1893 (which had only recently been involved in the fleet accident where she had rammed and sunk the battleship [[HMS Victoria (1887)|HMS ''Victoria'']]).<ref name=heath23/> He transferred to the battleship [[HMS Trafalgar (1887)|HMS ''Trafalgar'']] in September 1895.<ref name=heath23/>\n\n==Sudan Campaign==\nBeatty gained recognition during the [[Mahdist War]] for his actions in the campaign to recapture the [[Sudan]]. Stanley Colville was placed in command of the gunboats attached to the British expeditionary force in Egypt and as Beatty's former commander in HMS ''Trafalgar'' and superior in HMS ''Alexandra'' he requested that Beatty join him. Control of the river Nile was considered vitally important for any expedition into Egypt and the Sudan. Beatty was seconded to the Egyptian government on 3 June 1896 and appointed second in command of the river flotilla.<ref name=heath23/> Colville was wounded during the operation, leaving Beatty in command of the gunboats for the successful attack on [[Dongola]].<ref name=heath23/> The campaign halted at [[Dongola]] to regroup and Beatty returned to Britain on leave. He was commended by Kitchener for his part in the campaign and as a result was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>Roskill, p. 26-27, 29</ref>\n\nBeatty was again seconded to the Egyptian government for the next phase of the campaign. This was now at [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s specific request, for the [[Khartoum]] expedition. Beatty first commanded the gunboat ''El Teb'' but this was capsized attempting to ascend the Fourth Cataract.<ref name=heath23/> Beatty then took command of gunboat ''Fateh'' between October 1897 and August 1898:<ref name=heath23/> the gunboats were frequently in action advancing along the Nile ahead of the army and saw action at the [[Battle of Omdurman]], where Beatty made the acquaintance of [[Winston Churchill]] who had become a cavalry officer in Beatty's father's old regiment, the 4th Hussars, and had there learnt his family history. In a few hours 10,000 Dervishes were killed by rifle and machine gun fire without any of them getting within 600 yards of the British force.<ref>Beatty (1980), p. 29-30</ref> This battle marked the effective end of resistance to the expeditionary force, but the gunboats were called into service to transport troops to [[Fashoda]], {{convert|400|mi|km}} south along the White Nile, where a small force of French troops had made a difficult land crossing and staked a claim to the area. Despite [[Fashoda Crisis|the ensuing crisis]], the French were persuaded to withdraw without incident.<ref name=heath24>Heathcote, p. 24</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/fashoda-incident.htm |title=Fashoda Incident \u2013 1898|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Kitchener commended Beatty for his efforts in the campaign<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27009|page=5731|date=30 September 1898}}</ref> and as a result Beatty was promoted to [[commander]], ahead of 400 other lieutenants,<ref name=heath24/> on 15 November 1898.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27023|page=6692|date=15 November 1898}}</ref>\n\n==Boxer Rebellion==\nBeatty was appointed executive officer of the small battleship [[HMS Barfleur (1892)|HMS ''Barfleur'']], flagship of the [[Commander-in-Chief, China|China Station]], on 20 April 1899.<ref name=heath24/> The first year of his tour of duty was uneventful, but unrest against foreigners was growing in China. The [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer]] movement was a secret Chinese peasant society committed to resisting oppression both from foreigners and from the Chinese government. The [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi]] partly encouraged the Boxer's opposition to foreigners in an attempt to turn their attention away from herself. The name was derived from ritual exercises supposed to make their users immune to bullets, which resembled boxing.<ref>Roskill, p. 30</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1900 the rebellion reached [[Beijing|Peking]], where the German legation was attacked and foreign nationals withdrew to the relative safety of the Legation Quarter. Government troops joined forces with the rebels and the railway to the Treaty Port of [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] was interrupted. Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Sir Edward Seymour]], then the Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, sent reinforcements to Peking, but they were insufficient to defend the Legation. An attempt was therefore made to send more troops from Tientsin, where British ships had been joined by French, German, Russian, American, Austrian, Italian and Japanese. The international [[naval brigade]] force of naval marines placed itself under the senior officer present, which was Seymour. After an urgent call for help from the Legation, Seymour set out on 10 June 1900 with 2,000 troops to attempt to break through to Peking in the [[Seymour Expedition]]. The force got about half way before abandoning the attempt because the railway line had been torn up. By now rebels had begun destroying the track behind the force, cutting it off from Tientsin.<ref>Roskill, p. 31-32</ref>\n\n[[File:SeymourTianjin.jpg|thumb|right|Admiral Seymour returning to Tientsin with wounded men]]\nOn 11 June 1900, Beatty and 150 men from HMS ''Barfleur'' landed as part of a force of 2,400 defending Tientsin from 15,000 Chinese troops plus Boxers. On 16 June 1900 the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Taku forts were bombarded]] and captured to ensure ships could still reach the port. Fierce fighting broke out throughout the foreign areas and railway station, and Beatty was injured.<ref name=heath24/> He later took part in the successful relief of the naval brigade and was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] on 8 November 1900.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27245|page=6855|date=9 November 1900}}</ref> Beatty returned to Britain, where he required an operation to restore proper use of his left arm.<ref>Roskill, p. 32-33</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\nBeatty had returned from leave after the Sudan campaign, but finding life in Ireland at the family home not to his taste, stayed instead with his brother at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]. The location allowed him good hunting, and access to aristocratic houses where his recent heroic reputation from the campaign made him an honoured guest. Out hunting one day he chanced to meet [[Ethel Beatty|Ethel Tree]], daughter of Chicago department store founder [[Marshall Field]]. Beatty was immediately taken with her, for her good looks and her ability to hunt. The immediate difficulty with the match was that Ethel was married already to Arthur Tree, with a son, [[Ronald Tree]].<ref>Beatty (1980), p.31-35</ref>\n\nAfter the Boxer Campaign, the couple had at first exchanged letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, \"I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not. And now I have arrived with the firm determination not to see you at all in my own mind... Unfortunately I shall go on loving you to the bitter end... To me always a Queen, if not always mine, Good-bye.\"<ref>Beatty (1980), p.38</ref>\n\nDespite this estrangement, the couple again met foxhunting and resumed a discreet relationship. Marshall Field was at first unimpressed by the impecunious Beatty as a future son-in-law, but was persuaded by his heroic reputation, impressive record of promotion and future prospects. There was the possibility that Field might revoke the settlement he had made on his daughter at the time of her first marriage and the new couple would have no means of support. Beatty's father was also unhappy about the match, fearing a repeat of the difficulties he had faced with his own relationship with a married woman, but with the added risk of publicity because both Beatty and Ethel were famous and the risk that Beatty's illegitimacy might be exposed. Beatty went so far as to consult a fortune teller, Mrs. Roberts, who predicted a fine outcome to the match. Ethel wrote to Arthur, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live with him again as his wife, though not naming any particular person or reason. Arthur agreed to co-operate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Beatty and Ethel married on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square, London with no family attending. Although Arthur Tree was himself from a wealthy American family, he now had to adjust to reduced circumstances without Ethel's support. He elected to remain in Britain and their son Ronald remained with him. Ronald and his mother were never reconciled from his perception that she had deserted his father, but he visited in later life and became friendly with Beatty. Ronald later became a member of parliament and, during the [[Second World War]] became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house, [[Ditchley|Ditchley Park]] near [[Oxford]], to [[Winston Churchill]] for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe. Beatty and Ethel set up home at Hanover Lodge in Regent's Park, London.<ref>Beatty (1980), p.38-44</ref>\n\nThe couple had two sons, [[David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty|David Field Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty]] (1905\u20131972) born at the Capua Palace in [[Malta]], and the Hon. [[Peter Beatty|Peter Randolph Louis Beatty]] (1910\u20131949). His marriage to a very wealthy [[Beneficiary|heiress]] allowed Beatty an independence that most other officers lacked. She is reputed to have commented after he was threatened with disciplinary action following the straining of his ship's engines, \"What? Court-martial my David?

A \"probably [[apocryphal]]\"<ref>Massie, p. 92</ref> story relates that as Beatty walked into Churchill's office at the Admiralty, Churchill looked him over and said, \"You seem very young to be an Admiral.\"  Unfazed, Beatty replied, \"And you seem very young to be First Lord.\" Churchill \u2013 who was himself only thirty-eight years old in 1912 \u2013 took to him immediately and he was appointed [[Naval Secretary]].<ref>Gordon, p. 381</ref>\n\n[[File:LionSP 001672.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Lion (1910)|HMS ''Lion'']], flagship of the battlecruiser squadron]]\nBeatty became Rear-Admiral Commanding the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] on 1 March 1913.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beatty Papers |volume=I |page=57 }}</ref> Beatty was late taking up his new post, choosing not to cut short a holiday in [[Monte Carlo]]. On his eventual arrival, he set about drafting standing orders regarding how the squadron was to operate. He noted, \"Captains...to be successful must possess, in a marked degree, initiative, resource, determination, and no fear of accepting responsibility\". He went on \"...as a rule instructions will be of a very general character so as to avoid interfering with the judgement and initiative of captains...The admiral will rely on captains to use all the information at their disposal to grasp the situation quickly and anticipate his wishes, using their own discretion as to how to act in unforeseen circumstances...\" The approach outlined by Beatty contradicted the views of many within the navy, who felt that ships should always be closely controlled by their commanding admiral, and harked back to reforms attempted by Admiral [[George Tryon]]. It is argued that Tryon had attempted to introduce greater independence and initiative amongst his captains, which he believed would be essential in the confusion of a real war situation, but had ironically been killed in an accident caused by captains rigorously obeying incorrect but precise orders issued by Tryon himself.<ref>Gordon p.381-382.

Seymour had aristocratic connections, which may have appealed to Beatty since he sought connections in society, but it was also the case that Seymour's sister was a longstanding close friend of Churchill's wife.

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Lang]], said \"In him something of the spirit of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] seemed to have come back\". The Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], called in the House of Commons for a public memorial to Beatty to be erected, but no action was taken until after the [[Second World War]], when busts of Beatty and Jellicoe were unveiled in [[Trafalgar Square]] on 21 October ([[Trafalgar Day]]) 1948.<ref name=\"Roskill 1980, pp368\"/>\n\nBeatty had requested in his will that he would like to be buried next to his wife Ethel at Dingley: however he was actually buried at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and therefore the double grave at Dingley Church contains only his wife's body.<ref>Roskill, p. 366</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\nA number of serious errors have been identified in Beatty's handling of his [[naval squadron|squadron]] at the Battle of Jutland:\n*He failed to engage the German battlecruiser squadron with all his ships, thus throwing away a two-to-one numerical superiority and instead fighting one-to-one. Beatty was given command of the [[5th Battle Squadron]] to replace a squadron of battlecruisers away for training. These were four of the most powerful ships in the world, but he positioned them so far away from his six battlecruisers that they were unable to take part in most of the engagement with [[Franz von Hipper|Admiral Hipper's]] squadron of five battlecruisers.<ref>Brooks p. 232-234</ref>\n*Beatty did not take advantage of the time available to him between sighting the enemy and the start of fighting to position his battlecruisers to most effectively attack the enemy. At the point the German ships opened fire with accurately determined ranges for their [[naval artillery|guns]], Beatty's ships were still manoeuvring, some could not see the enemy because of their own smoke, and hardly any had the opportunity of a period of steady course as they approached to [[gun laying|properly determine target range]]. As a result, the German ships had a significant advantage in early hits, with obvious benefit. During this time he also lost the potential advantage of the larger guns on his ships: they could commence firing at a longer range than the German ships.<ref>Brooks p. 234-240</ref>\n*He did not ensure that signals sent to his ships were handled properly and received by the intended ships. Lost signals added to the confusion and lost opportunities during the battle. This issue had already arisen in previous battles, where the same signals officer had been involved, but no changes had been made.<ref>Brooks p. 232-233, 237</ref> Although Beatty was supposed to act as a fast armoured scout and report to Jellicoe the exact position of the German ships he encountered, or to keep in contact with the German fleet while he retreated to the main British Grand Fleet, he failed to do so. This information was important to Jellicoe to know how best to position the main fleet to make the most of its eventual engagement with the German High Seas Fleet. Despite this, Jellicoe succeeded in positioning his ships to good advantage, relying on other closer [[cruiser]]s for final knowledge of the German's position, but necessitating last-minute decisions.<ref>Brooks p. 232-240</ref> \n*Additionally, the gunnery of Beatty's ships was generally poor compared to the rest of the fleet. This was partly a consequence of his ships being stationed at Rosyth, rather than Scapa Flow with the main fleet, since local facilities at Rosyth were limited, but this was a problem identified months before Jutland which Beatty had failed to correct.<ref>Brooks p.226-227</ref>\n\nAfter the war a report of the battle was prepared by the Admiralty under First Sea Lord [[Baron Wester Wemyss|Rosslyn Wemyss]]. Before the report was published, Beatty was himself appointed First Sea Lord, and immediately requested amendments to the report. When the authors refused to comply, he ordered it to be destroyed and instead had prepared an alternative report, which proved highly critical of Jellicoe. Considerable argument broke out as a result, with significant numbers of servicemen disputing the published version, including Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]], who wrote his own book about the battle, criticising the version sponsored by Beatty and highly critical of Beatty's own part in the battle.<ref>Bacon, p. 1-253</ref>\n\nBesides actively encouraging the publication of books and articles designed to praise his role at the Battle of Jutland and denigrate Jellicoe's, after his retirement Beatty assisted with the preparation of a 5,200 line poem \"The Epic of Jutland\" by [[Shane Leslie]].<ref>Roskill 1980, pp322-29</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n\n<center>\n(ribbon bar, as it would look today)\n\n[[File:Order of the Bath UK ribbon.png|100px]]\n\n[[File:Order of Merit (Commonwealth realms) ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:Royal Victorian Order ribbon sm.jpg|100px]]\n[[File:Dso-ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:Queens Sudan Medal BAR.svg|100px]]\n\n[[Image:Third China War Medal BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:1914 1915 Star ribbon bar.svg|100px]]\n[[File:British War Medal BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Victory Medal ribbon bar.svg|100px]]\n\n[[File:King George V Coronation Medal ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:GeorgeVSilverJubileum-ribbon.png|100px]]\n[[File:Order of the Medjidie lenta.png|100px]]\n[[File:OrderStGeorge4cl rib.png|100px]]\n\n[[File:Grande ufficiale OMS BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:JPN Kyokujitsu-sho 1Class BAR.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Legion Honneur GC ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 ribbon.svg|100px]]\n\n[[File:Star of Romania Ribbon.PNG|100px]]\n[[File:GRE Order Redeemer 1Class.png|100px]]\n[[File:Navy Distinguished Service Medal ribbon.svg|100px]]\n[[File:JPN Kyokujitsu-sho Paulownia BAR.svg|100px]]\n\n</center>\n\n===British===\n*Companion of the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO)-17 November 1896<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=26795|page=6271|date=17 November 1896}}</ref>\n*[[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] (GCB)-31 May 1916<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29751|page=9070|date=15 September 1916|supp=y}}</ref> (KCB: 19 June 1914;<ref name=\"London Gazette\"/> CB: 19 June 1911)<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28505|page=4588|date=19 June 1911 |supp=y}}</ref>\n*[[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] (GCVO)-25 June 1917<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30156|page=6409|date=25 June 1917}}</ref> (KCVO: 17 June 1916<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29629|page=6063|date=20 June 1916 |supp=y}}</ref> Member Fourth Class (present-day Lieutenant)(MVO): 28 April 1905)<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27792|page=3401|date=28 April 1905}}</ref>\n*Member of the [[Order of Merit]] (OM)-3 June 1919<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31379|page=7046|date=3 June 1919 |supp=y}}</ref>\n*[[Earl Beatty]], Viscount Borodale of Wexford in the County of Wexford, Baron Beatty of the North Sea and of Brooksby in the County of Leicester-18 October 1919<ref name=\"london-gazette.co.uk\"/>\n\nBeatty was granted the [[Freedom of the City of London]] on 16 June 1919 at the same ceremony as [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Lord Haig]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist/BHC_RTV/1919/06/16/BGT407052911/?v=0|title=Haig and Beatty made freemen of the City of London|work=itnsource.com|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> In June 1920, the [[Great Central Railway]] gave the name ''Earl Beatty'' to one of their newly built [[4-6-0]] express passenger locomotives, no. 1164 of [[GCR Class 9P|class 9P]] (LNER class B3).

After the baronial victory at the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] took control of royal government, but at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the next year Montfort was killed, and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] restored to power. A group of rebels [[Siege of Kenilworth|held out]] in the stronghold of [[Kenilworth Castle]], however, and their resistance proved hard to crush.\n\nA [[Siege of Kenilworth|siege of the castle]] was started, but through papal intervention King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels the right to buy back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the [[Statute of Marlborough]].\n\n==Background==\nAt the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, the rebellious barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], had defeated the royal army and taken King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] captive.<ref>Prestwich (1988), pp. 45&ndash;6.</ref> For the next year, the reins of government were in Montfort's hands, but his support soon began to crumble.<ref>Prestwich (2005), pp. 115&ndash;6</ref> On 4 August 1265, Montfort faced an army led by Prince Edward (later King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]) and the powerful [[Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford|Earl of Gloucester]], who had recently defected to the royalist side, at the [[Battle of Evesham]].<ref>Maddicott (1994), pp. 327&ndash;9.</ref> The battle resulted in a complete royal victory; Montfort was killed, and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] was restored to full power.<ref>Prestwich (2005), pp. 116&ndash;7.</ref>\n\nPart of the rebellious forces held out, however, and their stronghold was the virtually impregnable [[Kenilworth Castle]].<ref>Prestwich (1988), pp. 52&ndash;3.</ref> In the summer of 1266, a siege of the castle was initiated, but the effort proved futile.<ref>Powicke (1947), pp. 531&ndash;2.</ref> There were rumours that Montfort's son [[Simon VI de Montfort|Simon]] was planning an invasion of England from [[Normandy]], and this was the hope that the rebels hung on to.<ref>Powicke (1953), p. 208.</ref> It was in this situation that the papal legate [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuono Fieschi]] exerted his influence, to make the king pursue a more conciliatory policy.<ref>Ottobuono later became pope, as [[Pope Adrian V|Adrian V]];

In east and southeast London, it forms part of the boroughs of [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]], [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], and [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]]. The [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] were formerly part of the [[Port of London]], at one time the [[world's largest port]]. Following the closure of the docks, the area became derelict and poverty-ridden by the 1980s. The Docklands' regeneration began later that decade; it has been redeveloped principally for commercial and residential use. The name \"London Docklands\" was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971 and has since become virtually universally adopted. The redevelopment created wealth, but also led to conflict between the new and old communities in the areas thus designated.\n\n== Establishment ==\nIn [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[medieval]] times, ships arriving in the [[River Thames]] tended to dock at small quays in the present-day [[City of London]] or [[Southwark]], an area known as the [[Pool of London]]. However, these gave no protection against the elements, were vulnerable to thieves and suffered from a lack of space at the quayside. The [[Greenland Dock|Howland Great Dock]] in [[Rotherhithe]] (built in 1696, and later to form the core of the [[Surrey Commercial Docks]]) was designed to address these problems, providing a large, secure and sheltered anchorage with room for 120 large vessels. It was a major commercial success, and provided for two phases of expansion during the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and [[Victorian era]]s.\n\nThe first of the Georgian docks was the [[West India Docks|West India]] (opened in 1802), followed by the [[London Docks|London]] (1805), the [[East India Docks|East India]] (also 1805), the Surrey (1807), the [[Regent's Canal Dock]] (1820), [[St Katharine Docks|St Katharine]] (1828) and the West India South (1829). The Victorian docks were mostly further east, comprising the [[Royal Victoria Dock|Royal Victoria]] (1855), [[Millwall Dock|Millwall]] (1868) and [[Royal Albert Dock|Royal Albert]] (1880). The [[King George V Dock, London|King George V Dock]] was a late addition in 1921.\n\n==Development==\nThree principal kinds of docks existed. ''Wet docks'' were where ships were laid up at anchor and loaded or unloaded. ''Dry docks'', which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at ''dockyards'' along the riverside. In addition, the river was lined with innumerable [[List of locations in the Port of London|warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins]] (mooring points). The various docks tended to specialise in different forms of produce. The Surrey Docks [[British timber trade|concentrated on timber]], for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.\n\nThe docks required an army of workers, chiefly [[lightermen]] (who carried loads between ships and quays aboard small barges called [[Lighter (barge)|lighter]]s) and quayside workers, who dealt with the goods once they were ashore. Some of the workers were highly skilled: the lightermen had their own [[livery company]] or guild, while the [[deal porters]] (workers who carried timber) were famous for their acrobatic skills. Most were unskilled and worked as casual labourers. They assembled at certain points, such as pubs, each morning, where they were selected more or less at random by foremen. For these workers, it was effectively a lottery as to whether they would get work\u2014and pay, and food\u2014on any particular day. This arrangement continued until as late as 1965, although it was somewhat regularised after the creation of the [[National Dock Labour Scheme]] in 1947.\n\nThe main dockland areas were originally low-lying marshes, mostly unsuitable for agriculture and lightly populated. With the establishment of the docks, the dock workers formed a number of tight-knit local communities with their own distinctive cultures and slang. Poor communications meant that they were quite remote from other parts of London, and so tended to develop in some isolation. The [[Isle of Dogs]], for example, could only be accessed by road via two swing-bridges. Local sentiment there was so strong that Ted Johns, a local community campaigner, and his supporters, in protest at the lack of social provision from the state, proclaimed a unilateral declaration of independence for the area, setting up a so-called 'Island Council' with Johns himself as its elected leader, and blocked off the two roads coming in from the mainland.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1461749/Ted-Johns.html Ted Johns] Telegraph 14 May 2004 accessed 14 May 2015 2007</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n[[Image:Museum in Docklands at night 2005-01-10.JPG|thumb|[[Museum of London Docklands]], near Canary Wharf]]\nThe docks were originally built and managed by a number of competing private companies. From 1909, they were managed by the [[Port of London Authority]] (PLA) which amalgamated the companies in a bid to make the docks more efficient and improve [[labour relations]]. The PLA constructed the last of the docks, the King George V, in 1921, as well as greatly expanding the [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury docks]].\n\n[[The Blitz|German bombing]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] caused massive damage to the docks, with 380,000 tons of [[timber]] destroyed in the Surrey Docks in a single night. Nonetheless, following post-war rebuilding they experienced a resurgence of prosperity in the 1950s. The end came suddenly, between approximately 1960 and 1970, when the shipping industry adopted the newly invented [[Containerization|container system]] of cargo transportation. London's docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerization, and the shipping industry moved to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]]. Between 1960 and 1980, all of London's docks were closed, leaving around eight square miles (21&nbsp;km\u00b2) of derelict land in East London. Unemployment was high, and poverty and other social problems were rife.\n\n==Redevelopment==\n[[File:Canary Wharf at Sunset.jpg|thumb|Canary Wharf at sunset]]\n\nEfforts to redevelop the docks began almost as soon as they were closed, although it took a decade for most plans to move beyond the drawing board and another decade for redevelopment to take full effect. The situation was greatly complicated by the large number of landowners involved: the PLA, the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC), the [[British Gas plc|British Gas Corporation]], five borough councils, [[British Rail]] and the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]].\n\nTo address this problem, in 1981 the [[Secretary of State for the Environment]], [[Michael Heseltine]], formed the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] (LDDC) to redevelop the area. This was a statutory body appointed and funded by central government (a [[quango]]), with wide powers to acquire and dispose of land in the Docklands. It also served as the development planning authority for the area.\n\nAnother important government intervention was the designation in 1982 of an [[enterprise zone]], an area in which businesses were exempt from property taxes and had other incentives, including simplified planning and capital allowances. This made investing in the Docklands a significantly more attractive proposition and was instrumental in starting a property boom in the area.\n\nThe LDDC was controversial; it was accused of favouring elitist luxury developments rather than affordable housing, and it was unpopular with the local communities, who felt that their needs were not being addressed. Nonetheless, the LDDC was central to a remarkable transformation in the area, although how far it was in control of events is debatable. It was wound up in 1998 when control of the Docklands area was handed back to the respective local authorities.\n\nThe massive development programme managed by the LDDC during the 1980s and 1990s saw a huge area of the Docklands converted into a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial space. The clearest symbol of the whole effort was the ambitious [[Canary Wharf]] project that constructed Britain's tallest building at the time and established a second major financial centre in London. However, there is no evidence that the LDDC foresaw this scale of development; nearby [[Heron Quays]] had already been developed as low-density offices when Canary Wharf was proposed, and similar development was already underway on Canary Wharf itself, [[Limehouse Studios]] being the most famous occupant.\n\nCanary Wharf was far from trouble-free; the property slump of the early 1990s halted further development for several years. Developers found themselves, for a time, saddled with property that they were unable to sell or let.\n\n==Transport==\n<!-- [[File:docks-transport.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rail Transport in the Docklands in 2003 {{deletable image-caption}}]]-->\nThe Docklands historically had poor transport connections. This was addressed by the LDDC with the construction of the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR), which connected the Docklands with the City. According to Transport for London, the owner of the project, it was a remarkably<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/|title=Docklands Light Railway Capacity Upgrade|last=|first=|date=|website=Railway Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theb1m.com/video/building-an-urban-railway-30-years-of-the-dlr|title=Building an Urban Railway: 30 Years of th DLR|last=Ravenscroft|first=Tom|date=September 2017|website=The B1M|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> inexpensive development, costing only \u00a377 million in its first phase, as it relied on reusing disused railway infrastructure and derelict land for much of its length. The LDDC originally requested a full [[London Underground]] line, but the Government refused to fund it.\n\nThe LDDC also built the [[Limehouse Link tunnel]], a [[cut and cover]] road tunnel linking the Isle of Dogs to [[The Highway]] (the A1203 road) at a cost of over \u00a3150 million per kilometre, one of the most expensive stretches of road ever built.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe LDDC also contributed to the development of [[London City Airport]] ([[IATA airport code]] LCY), opened in October 1987 on the spine of the [[Royal Docks]].\n\nThe London Underground's [[Jubilee line]] was extended eastwards in 1999; it now serves Rotherhithe/[[Surrey Quays]] at [[Canada Water station]], the Isle of Dogs at [[Canary Wharf tube station]], [[Greenwich]] at [[North Greenwich tube station]] and the nearby Royal Docks at [[Canning Town station]]. The DLR was extended in 1994 to serve much of the Royal Docks area when the [[Beckton]] branch was opened. The Isle of Dogs branch was extended further south, and in 1999 it began serving Greenwich town centre\u2014including the [[Cutty Sark]] museum\u2014[[Deptford]] and finally [[Lewisham]]. In 2005, a new branch of the DLR opened from Canning Town to serve what used to be the eastern terminus of the [[North London Line]], including a station at [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]]. It was then further extended to [[Woolwich Arsenal station|Woolwich Arsenal]] in 2009.\n\n===Future developments===\nFurther development projects are being proposed and put into practice within the London Dockland area, such as:\n\n* Extensions of the DLR, possibly to [[Dagenham]].\n* [[Crossrail]] links to central London, [[Reading railway station|Reading]] and [[Heathrow Airport]].\n* Further development of [[Canada Water]].\n* Redevelopment of [[Blackwall Basin]] and [[Wood Wharf]], east of Canary Wharf.\n* New skyscrapers to be built at Canary Wharf, including the [[Riverside South (Canary Wharf)|Riverside South]] towers, the [[Heron Quays West]] double-skyscraper development and the [[North Quay, London|North Quay]] project, consisting of three towers.\n\nIn the early 21st century, redevelopment is spreading into the more suburban parts of east and southeast London, and into the parts of the counties of [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] that abut the [[Thames Estuary]]. See [[Thames Gateway]] and [[Lower Lea Valley]] for further information on this trend.\n\n===Docklands series buses===\n\n====History====\nThe numbers of several [[London Buses]] routes are prefixed ''D'' for Docklands; all run on the north bank of the River Thames as part of the London bus network, and act as feeder buses to the DLR. The ''D'' network was developed in the early stages of Docklands redevelopment; it was originally much larger, but as transport rapidly improved across east London, the need for the ''D'' routes reduced. Today only four remain, running primarily in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] and briefly into [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] and [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. [[Docklands Buses]] operates all routes apart from route D3, which is run by [[Stagecoach London]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==21st century==\nThe population of the Docklands has more than doubled during the last 30 years, and the area has become both a major business centre and an increasingly desirable area to live.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Canary Wharf has become one of Europe's biggest clusters of skyscrapers and a direct challenge to the financial dominance of the City of London.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAlthough most of the old wharfs and warehouses have been demolished, some have been restored and converted into flats. Most of the docks themselves have survived and are now used as marinas or watersports centres, the major exception being the Surrey Commercial Docks which are now largely filled in. Although large ships can\u2014and occasionally still do\u2014visit the old docks, all of the commercial traffic has moved downriver.\n\nThe revival of the Docklands has had major effects in run-down surrounding areas. Greenwich and Deptford are undergoing large-scale redevelopment, chiefly as a result of the improved transport links making them more attractive to commuters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe Docklands' redevelopment has, however, had some less beneficial aspects. The massive property boom and consequent rise in house prices has led to friction between the new arrivals and the old Docklands communities, who have complained of being squeezed out. It has also made for some of the most striking disparities to be seen anywhere in Britain: luxury executive flats constructed alongside run-down public housing estates.\n\nThe Docklands' status as a symbol of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain has also made it a target for terrorists. After a failed attempt to bomb Canary Wharf in 1992, a large IRA [[1996 Docklands bombing|bomb exploded at South Quay on 9 February 1996]]. Two people died in the explosion, forty people were injured and an estimated \u00a3150 million of damage was caused.<ref>''The parlous state of the Docklands property market at the time of the blast, combined with a lengthy delay in implementing redevelopment, means a true estimate of the financial cost is difficult to reach.'' {{verifysource|date=December 2009}}</ref> This bombing ended an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] ceasefire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/10/newsid_2539000/2539265.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 10 &#124; 1996: Docklands bomb ends IRA ceasefire |publisher=BBC News |date=10 February 1996 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> James McArdle was imprisoned for 25 years after a trial at [[Woolwich]] [[Crown Court]] that ended on 24 June 1998.

A DMU requires no separate [[locomotive]], as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. Diesel-powered single-unit [[railcar]]s are also generally classed as DMUs. Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type: diesel\u2013electric (DEMU), diesel\u2013mechanical (DMMU) or diesel\u2013hydraulic (DHMU).\n\n==Design==\nThe diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or in a separate car.\n\n==Types==\nDMUs are usually classified by the method of transmitting motive power to their wheels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Diesel\u2013mechanical {{Anchor|DMMU}}===\nIn a diesel\u2013mechanical multiple unit (DMMU), the rotating energy of the engine is transmitted via a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and driveshaft directly to the wheels of the train, like a [[automobile|car]]. The transmissions can be shifted manually by the driver, as in the great majority of first-generation [[British Rail]] DMUs, but in most applications gears are changed automatically.\n\n===Diesel\u2013hydraulic===\nIn a diesel\u2013hydraulic multiple unit (DHMU), a hydraulic [[torque converter]], a type of fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel engine to turn the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.\n\n===Diesel\u2013electric {{Anchor|DEMU}}===\nIn a diesel\u2013electric multiple unit (DEMU), a [[diesel engine]] drives an [[electrical generator]] or an [[Alternator#Diesel electric locomotive alternators|alternator]] which produces [[electrical energy]]. The generated current is then fed to electric [[traction motor]]s on the [[wheel]]s or [[bogie]]s in the same way as a conventional [[diesel\u2013electric locomotive]].<ref name=\"gaz-voyager\" />\n\nIn modern DEMUs, such as the [[Bombardier Voyager family]], each car is entirely self-contained and has its own engine, generator and electric motors.<ref name=\"gaz-voyager\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//cutting-noise-and-smoothing-the-ride.html|title=Cutting noise and smoothing the ride|publisher=Railway Gazette|date=1 August 2000|quote=In the Voyager application, every car has a Cummins underfloor engine and alternator supplying power to a pair of body-mounted traction motors.

It also permits passenger capacity to be matched to demand, and for trains to be split and joined en route. It is not necessary to match the power available to the size and weight of the train, as each unit is capable of moving itself. As units are added, the power available to move the train increases by the necessary amount. DMUs may have better acceleration capabilities, with more power-driven axles, making them more suitable for routes with frequent closely spaced stops, as compared with conventional locomotive and unpowered carriage setups.\n\nDistribution of the propulsion among the cars also results in a system that is less vulnerable to single-point-of-failure outages. Many classes of DMU are capable of operating with faulty units still in the consist. Because of the self-contained nature of diesel engines, there is no need to run [[Railway electrification|overhead electric lines]] or [[Third rail|electrified track]], which can result in lower system construction costs.\n\nSuch advantages must be weighed against the underfloor noise and vibration that may be an issue with this type of train.\n\nGenerally diesel traction has several downsides compared to electric traction, namely higher fuel costs, more noise and exhaust as well as worse acceleration and top speed performance. The power to weight ratio also tends to be worse.\n\nDMUs have further disadvantages compared to diesel locomotives in that they cannot be swapped out when passing onto an electrified line, necessitating either passengers to change trains or Diesel operation on electrified lines. Similarly the lost investment once electrification reduces the demand for diesel rolling stock is higher than with locomotive hauled trains where only the locomotive has to be replaced.\n\n==Around the world==\n\n===Europe===\n\n==== Croatia ====\nDiesel multiple units are in constant use in [[Croatia]], operated by national operator [[Croatian Railways]]. On Croatian Railways, DMUs have important role since they cover local, regional and distant lines across the country. Two largest towns in Croatia, [[Zagreb]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]], are daily connected with DMU [[Tilting train|titling]] trains \"[[RegioSwinger]]\" (Croatian series 7123) that provide Inter City service between those two towns since 2004.\n\nIn the early 1990s, luxury DMU series [[H\u017d series 7021|7021]] (ordered for [[Yugoslav Railways]] in 1970s, now scrapped) provided some of higher ranked lines across the country. DMU series [[H\u017d series 7121]] (renumbered leftover from former Yugoslav Railways), [[Y1 (railcar)|7122]] (ordered from Sweden in late 1990's) and later Croatian-built series 7022 and 7023 ([[prototype]]-remained) are nowadays in high use covering country's local and regional services, mostly in country's interior on the tracks that are not fully electrified.\n\n====Ireland====\n[[File:IE DMU 2751.JPG|thumb|right|[[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]] [[IE 2700 and 2750 Classes|DMU 2751]] at [[Limerick railway station|Limerick Colbert station]], 2006]]\n\n{{Main article|Multiple Units of Ireland}}\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland the [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann]] (CI\u00c9), which controlled the republic's railways between 1945 and 1986, introduced DMUs in the mid-1950s and they were the first diesel trains on many main lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gApAhy8QvoEC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=ireland+diesel+multiple+unit+1950&source=bl&ots=ge35Y5tY7v&sig=zsAIE9Brs1J9GETmaU3ELRwkIMo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUmcTOn4XZAhXN11MKHdeVAPA4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&q=ireland%20diesel%20multiple%20unit%201950&f=false|title=An A-Z of Famous Express Trains: An Illustrated Trip Down Memory Lane|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:222009 at St Pancras.jpg|thumb|right|[[East Midlands Trains]] [[British Rail Class 222|222009]] at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]]]]\n[[File:170518 at Peterborough.JPG|thumb|[[Central Trains]] [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] at [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough station]]]]\n[[File:The 12 - 52 to Londonderry leaves Yorkgate station - geograph.org.uk - 2359652.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Ireland Railways]] [[NIR Class 3000|C3K]] at [[Yorkgate railway station|Yorkgate station]]]]\n{{further information|British railcars and diesel multiple units|List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes}}\n\nThe first significant use of DMUs in the United Kingdom was by the [[Great Western Railway]], which introduced its small but successful series of diesel\u2013mechanical [[GWR railcars]] in 1934. The [[London and North Eastern Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lner.info/locos/IC/aw_railcar.php|title=LNER Encyclopedia: The LNER Armstrong-Whitworth Diesel\u2013Electric Railcars|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> and [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] also experimented with DMUs in the 1930s, the LMS both on [[LMS railcars|its own system]], and on that of its [[Northern Counties Committee#Railcars|Northern Irish subsidiary]], but development was curtailed by [[World War II]].\n\nAfter nationalisation, [[British Rail]]ways (BR) revived the concept in the early 1950s. At that time there was an urgent need to move away from expensive steam traction which led to many experimental designs using diesel propulsion and [[multiple unit]]s. The early DMUs proved successful, and under BR's [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948\u20131994#The Modernisation Plan|1955 Modernisation Plan]] the building of a large fleet was authorised. These BR \"First Generation\" DMUs were built between 1956 and 1963.\n\nBR required that contracts for the design and manufacture of new locomotives and rolling stock be split between numerous private firms as well as BR's own workshops, while different BR Regions laid down different specifications. The result was a multitude of different types, one of which was:\n* 'Intercity' units, which were more substantially constructed, and shared many features with contemporary hauled coaching stock.

A stopgap solution was to convert some services back to locomotive haulage, as spare locomotives and hauled coaching stock were available, but this also increased operating costs. Commencing in the mid '80s, British Rail embarked upon its so called \"Sprinterisation\" programme, to replace most of the first generation DMUs and many locomotive-hauled trains with three new families of DMU:\n*[[Pacer (train)|Class 140\u2013144]] ''Pacer'' [[railbus]]es, ultra-low-cost diesel\u2013mechanical units utilising 4-wheeled chassis and lightweight bus bodywork, designed for provincial branch line and stopping services.\n*[[Sprinter (train)|Sprinter]] a family of diesel\u2013hydraulic DMUs.

From the September 1935 issue of Gernsback's ''Wonder Stories'':\n{{quote| \nTHREE MEMBERS EXPELLED\n\nIt grieves us to announce that we have found the first disloyalty in our organization...

It is for them and for the fan who admits it is his hobby and not his business that we formed the FAPA.\" In 1938, with several friends, he formed the [[Futurians]]\u2014arguably the best-known of the science fiction clubs. At one time or another, the membership included [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Cyril Kornbluth]], [[James Blish]], [[John B. Michel|John Michel]], [[Judith Merril]], [[Robert A. W.

It proved to be a lasting marriage and a publishing partnership.\n\nThe Futurians became less fan-oriented and more professional after 1940. Its conferences and workshops focused on writing, editing, and publishing, with many of its members interested in all three.<ref name=\"Locus90\"/>\n\n==Author==\n\nWollheim's first story, \"The Man from Ariel\", was published in the January 1934 issue of ''[[Wonder Stories]]''<ref name=isfdb/><ref>{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Steven H|authorlink=Steven H Silver|title=Debut Science Fiction|url=http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/debut.html#W:|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> when he was nineteen. \n[[File:Don Wollheim & daughter Betsy.jpg|thumb|left|Don Wollheim and his daughter Elizabeth (1954).]] \nHe was not paid for the story, and when he learned that other authors had not been paid either, he said so in the ''Bulletin'' of the Terrestrial Fantascience Guild.<ref name=\"speer\">{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack Speer|title=Up to Now|publisher=Full-Length Articles|year=1939}}</ref> Publisher [[Hugo Gernsback]] eventually settled with Wollheim and the other authors out of court for $75.

In the 1950s and 60s he wrote chiefly novels. He usually used pseudonyms for works aimed at grownups, and wrote children's novels under his own name. Notable and popular were the eight \"Mike Mars\" books for children, which explored different facets of the [[NASA]] space program.<ref name=\"ency\"/> Also well-received were the \"Secret\" books for young readers: ''The Secret of Saturn's Rings'' (1954), ''Secret of the Martian Moons'' (1955), and ''The Secret of the Ninth Planet'' (1959). As Martin Pearson he published the \"Ajax Calkins\" series, which became the basis for his novel ''Destiny's Orbit'' (1962).<ref name=\"ency\"/> A sequel, ''Destination: Saturn'' was published in 1967 in collaboration with [[Lin Carter]]. ''The Universe Makers'' (1971) is a discussion of themes and philosophy in science fiction.\n\nOne of Wollheim's short stories, \"Mimic\", was made into the feature [[Mimic (film)|film]] of the same name, released in 1997.<ref>{{IMDb name|938586}}.</ref>\n\nHis daughter [[Betsy Wollheim|Betsy]] declared: \"In true editorial fashion, he was honest about the quality of his own writing.

He wrote to the publishers, Albing Publications, to see if they were interested in adding a science fiction title to their list, and he was invited to meet them. They  did not have capital, however, and only guaranteed him a salary if the magazines were successful. He approached some of his fellow Futurians for free stories (some published under pseudonyms to protect their reputations with paying editors).<ref name=\"earlyyears166_169\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/166/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=166\u2013169}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Futurians|last = Knight|first = Damon|publisher = John Day|year = 1977|location = New York|pages=60\u201383}}</ref> It resulted in Wollheim's editing two of the earliest periodicals devoted to science fiction, the ''[[Cosmic Stories]]'' and ''[[Stirring Science Stories]]'' magazines starting in February 1941.

These periodicals contained mostly reprints and a few original stories.\n\nIn 1952 Wollheim left Avon to work for [[A. A. Wyn]] at the Ace Magazine Company and spearheaded a new paperback book list, [[Ace Books]]. In 1953 he introduced science fiction to the Ace lineup,<ref name=\"smith\"/> and for 20 years as editor-in-chief was responsible for their multi-genre list and, most important to him, their renowned sf list.<ref name=\"ency\"/> Wollheim invented the ''[[Ace Double]]s'' series which consisted of pairs of books, usually by different authors, bound back-to-back with two \"front\" covers.<ref name=\"silver\"/> Because these paired books had to fit a fixed total page length, one or both were usually abridged to fit, and Wollheim often made other editorial alterations \u2014 as witness the differences between [[Poul Anderson]]'s Ace novel ''War of the Wing-Men'' and its definitive revised edition, ''The Man Who Counts''. Among the authors who made their paperback debuts in Ace Doubles were [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]].<ref name=\"silver\"/> [[William S. Burroughs]]' first book, ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'', was published as an Ace Double.<ref name=\"silver\"/> Wollheim also helped develop [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Avram Davidson]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Thomas Burnett Swann]], [[Jack Vance]], and [[Roger Zelazny]], among others. While at Ace, he and co-editor Terry Carr began an annual anthology series, ''The World's Best Science Fiction'', the first collection of what they considered the best of the prior year's short stories, from magazines, hardcovers, paperback collections and other anthologies.<ref name=\"Locus90\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s Ace reintroduced Edgar Rice Burroughs' work, which had long been out of print, and in 1965, Ace bought the paperback rights to ''[[Dune]]''.<ref name=\"Locus90\"/> (Herbert's title worried Wollheim, who feared it would be mistaken for a western.)<ref name=\"betsy\"/> Eventually, Ace introduced single paperback books and became one of the preeminent genre publishers. Ace and Ballantine dominated sf in the 1960s and built the genre by publishing original material as well as reprints.<ref name=\"Locus90\"/>\n\n[[File:3 Ace Tolkien.jpeg|thumb|The Ace editions of ''The Lord of the Rings''.]] \nBefore the 1960s, no American paperback publisher would publish fantasy. It was believed that there was no public for fantasy and that it would not sell. Wollheim published an unauthorized paperback edition of [[J. R. R.

He was very offended. He did a little research and discovered a loophole in the copyright. Houghton Mifflin, Tolkien\u2019s American hardcover publisher, had neglected to protect the work in the United States. So, incensed by Tolkien\u2019s response, he realized that he could legally publish them and did.\n\nThis brash action (which ultimately benefited his primary competitors) was really the Big Bang that founded the modern fantasy field, and only someone like my father could have done that.

Few of them had any publishing experience before they found themselves running Ace. It showed.

DAW can claim to be the first mass market specialist science fiction and [[fantasy fiction]] publishing house.<ref name=\"smith\"/> DAW issued its first four titles in April 1972. Most of the writers whom he had developed at Ace went with him to DAW: Marion Zimmer Bradley, Andre Norton, Philip K. Dick, John Brunner, [[A. Bertram Chandler]], [[Kenneth Bulmer]], [[Gordon R. Dickson]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], and [[Jack Vance]]. In later years, when his distributor, [[New American Library]], threatened to withhold [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s Biblical fantasy ''How Are the Mighty Fallen'' (1974) because of its homosexual content, Wollheim fought vigorously against their decision and they relented.\n\nHis later author discoveries included [[Tanith Lee]], [[Jennifer Roberson]], [[Michael Shea (author)|Michael Shea]], [[Tad Williams]], [[Celia S.

For digital image capture, see [[digital cinematography]].}}\n'''Digital cinema''' refers to the use of [[digital data|digital]] technology to [[film distributor|distribute]] or [[video projector|project]] [[motion picture]]s as opposed to the historical use of reels of [[motion picture film]], such as 35&nbsp;mm film. Whereas film reels have to be shipped to [[movie theater]]s, a digital movie can be distributed to cinemas in a number of ways: over the [[Internet]] or dedicated [[satellite]] links, or by sending [[hard drives]] or [[optical disc]]s such as [[Blu-ray]] discs. Digital movies are projected using a [[video projector|digital video projector]] instead of a [[movie projector|film projector]]. Digital cinema is distinct from [[high-definition television]] and does not necessarily use traditional television or other traditional [[high-definition video]] standards, aspect ratios, or frame rates. In digital cinema, resolutions are represented by the horizontal pixel count, usually [[2K resolution|2K]] (2048\u00d71080 or 2.2 [[megapixel]]s) or [[4K resolution|4K]] (4096\u00d72160 or 8.8 megapixels).

Early video data storage units ([[RAID]]s) fed custom frame buffer systems with large memories.  In early digital video units, content was usually restricted to several minutes of material. Transfer of content between remote locations was slow and had limited capacity. It was not until the late 1990s that feature-length films could be sent over the \"wire\" (Internet or dedicated fiber links). On October 23, 1998, [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) projector technology was publicly demonstrated with the release of ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'', the first feature-length movie, shot, edited and distributed digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/1998-10-15/editors-pick/live-satellite-first-digital-premiere |title=Live via satellite: the first digital premiere &#124; Penn Current |publisher=Upenn.edu |date=1998-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/d_day_for_two_digital_movies_as_the_cruise_and_the_last_broadcast_debut_in_ |title=D Day for Two Digital Movies as \"The Cruise\" and \"The Last Broadcast\" Debut in Theaters Today &#124; Filmmakers, Film Industry, Film Festivals, Awards & Movie Reviews |publisher=Indiewire |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastbroadcastmovie.com/tlb99/filmmakersbios.htm |title=The Last Broadcast |publisher=Thelastbroadcastmovie.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> In conjunction with Texas Instruments, the movie was publicly demonstrated in five theaters across the United States ([[Philadelphia]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland (Oregon)]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]).\n\n===Foundations===\n[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype Projector, Mark V, 2000]]\nIn the [[United States]], on June 18, 1999, Texas Instruments' ''DLP Cinema'' projector technology was publicly demonstrated on two screens in Los Angeles and New York for the release of Lucasfilm's ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''.<ref>[[Charles S.

In 2007, the UK became home to Europe's first DCI-compliant fully digital multiplex cinemas; Odeon Hatfield and Odeon Surrey Quays (in London), with a total of 18 digital screens, were launched on 9 February 2007. By March 2007, with the release of Disney's ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', about 600 screens had been equipped with 2K digital projectors that used [[Real D Cinema]]'s stereoscopic 3D technology, marketed under the [[Disney Digital 3-D]] brand. In June 2007, Arts Alliance Media announced the first European commercial digital cinema [[Virtual Print Fee]] (VPF) agreements (with [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Universal Pictures]]). In March 2009 [[AMC Theatres]] announced that it closed a $315 million deal with [[Sony]] to replace all of its [[movie projector]]s with 4K digital projectors starting in the second quarter of 2009; it was anticipated that this replacement would be finished by 2012.<ref>{{Cite news   | last = Taub  | first = Eric A.  | title = AMC to Get Sony Digital Projectors  | newspaper = New York Times  | location = New York  | date = March 29, 2009  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/technology/companies/30sony.html  | accessdate = November 19, 2009}}</ref>\n[[Image:Ten Main Center-AMC Bldg-Kansas City MO.jpg|thumb|[[AMC Theatres]] former corporate headquarters in Kansas City, prior to their 2013 move to Leawood, Kansas.]]\n\nBy June 2010, there were close to 16,000 digital cinema screens, with over 5000 of them being stereoscopic setups.

[[Christopher Nolan]] also released his latest film ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' in IMAX, 70 mm, and 35 mm in selected theaters across the world. If digital cinema were to completely eclipse film stock in the cinema, it would take another five to ten years to do so.\n\n==Elements==\nIn addition to the equipment already found in a film-based movie theatre (e.g., a [[sound reinforcement system]], screen, etc.), a DCI-compliant digital cinema requires a digital projector and a powerful computer known as a \"[[server (computing)|server]]\". Movies are supplied to the theatre as a digital file called a [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/technology/e3i6e1af20cf8f6d2fb94cd8d64bc8948e7 |title=The ABCs of DCPs: Unwrapping the Digital Cinema Package |publisher=Filmjournal.com |date=2012-08-28}}</ref> For a typical feature film, this file will be anywhere between 90 GB and 300 GB of data (roughly two to six times the information of a Blu-ray disc) and may arrive as a physical delivery on a conventional computer hard drive or via satellite or fibre-optic broadband Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doremilabs.com/downloads/manuals/DCP-2000_and_DCP-2K4_User_Manual_001822_v1_2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319052633/http://www.doremilabs.com/downloads/manuals/DCP-2000_and_DCP-2K4_User_Manual_001822_v1_2.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2013|title=DCP-2000 and DCP-2K4 User Manual }}</ref>  As of 2013, physical deliveries of hard drives were most common in the industry. Promotional trailers arrive on a separate hard drive and range between 200 GB and 400 GB in size.\n\nRegardless of how the DCP arrives, it first needs to be copied onto the internal hard drives of the server, usually via a USB port, a process known as \"ingesting\". DCPs can be, and in the case of feature films almost always are, encrypted, to prevent illegal copying and piracy. The necessary decryption keys are supplied separately, usually as email attachments and then \"ingested\" via USB. Keys are time-limited and will expire after the end of the period for which the title has been booked. They are also locked to the hardware (server and projector) that is to screen the film, so if the theatre wishes to move the title to another screen or extend the run, a new key must be obtained from the distributor.<ref>{{cite web|author=MKPE Consulting LLC |url=http://www.mkpe.com/digital_cinema/works/dc_technology4.php |title=How Digital Cinema Works: Part 4 |publisher=Mkpe.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> Several versions of the same feature can be sent together. The original version (OV) is used as the basis of all the other playback options. Version files (VF) may have a different sound format (e.g. 7.1 as opposed to [[5.1 surround sound]]) or subtitles. 2D and 3D versions are often distributed on the same hard drive.\n\nThe playback of the content is controlled by the server using a \"playlist\". As the name implies, this is a list of all the content that is to be played as part of the performance. The playlist will be created by a member of the theatre's staff using proprietary software that runs on the server. In addition to listing the content to be played the playlist also includes automation cues that allow the playlist to control the projector, the sound system, auditorium lighting, tab curtains and screen masking (if present), etc. The playlist can be started manually, by clicking the \"play\" button on the server's monitor screen, or automatically at pre-set times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dolby.com/gb/en/professional/hardware/cinema/cinema-servers/dss200.html |title=Dolby Screen Server (DSS200) |publisher=Dolby.com |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101065704/http://www.dolby.com/gb/en/professional/hardware/cinema/cinema-servers/dss200.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Technology and standards==\n\n===Digital Cinema Initiatives===\n[[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] (DCI), a joint venture of the six [[major film studios|major studios]], published the first version (V1.0) of a system specification for digital cinema in July 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=DCI Cinema Specification v1.2 |url=http://www.dcimovies.com/specification/ | publisher=Digital Cinema Initiatives |date= March 7, 2008 |accessdate =January 1, 2011}}</ref> The main declared objectives of the specification were to define a digital cinema system that would ''\"present a theatrical experience that is better than what one could achieve now with a traditional 35mm Answer Print\"'', to provide global standards for interoperability such that any DCI-compliant content could play on any DCI-compliant hardware anywhere in the world and to provide robust protection for the intellectual property of the content providers.\n\nThe DCI specification calls for picture encoding using the ISO/IEC 15444-1 \"[[JPEG2000]]\" (.j2c) standard and use of the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ]] color space at 12 bits per component encoded with a 2.6 [[gamma correction|gamma]] applied at projection. Two levels of resolution for both content and projectors are supported: 2K (2048\u00d71080) or 2.2 MP at 24 or 48 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], and 4K (4096\u00d72160) or 8.85 MP at 24 frames per second. The specification ensures that 2K content can play on 4K projectors and vice versa. Smaller resolutions in one direction are also supported (the image gets automatically centered). Later versions of the standard added additional playback rates (like 25 fps in SMPTE mode). For the sound component of the content the specification provides for up to 16 channels of uncompressed audio using the [[Broadcast Wave Format|\"Broadcast Wave\" (.wav)]] format at 24 bits and 48&nbsp;kHz or 96&nbsp;kHz sampling.\n\nPlayback is controlled by an [[XML]]-format Composition Playlist, into an [[MXF]]-compliant file at a maximum data rate of 250 Mbit/s. Details about encryption, [[key management]], and logging are all discussed in the specification as are the minimum specifications for the projectors employed including the [[color gamut]], the [[contrast ratio]] and the brightness of the image. While much of the specification codifies work that had already been ongoing in the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ([[SMPTE]]), the specification is important in establishing a content owner framework for the distribution and security of first-release motion-picture content.\n\n===National Association of Theatre Owners===\nIn addition to DCI's work, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) released its Digital Cinema System Requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATO Digital Cinema Requirements v2.1 |url=http://www.natoonline.org/pdfs/NATO%20Digital%20Cinema%20System%20Requirements%20-%20release%202%201.pdf |format=PDF |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326214343/http://www.natoonline.org/pdfs/NATO%20Digital%20Cinema%20System%20Requirements%20-%20release%202%201.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |df= }}</ref> The document addresses the requirements of digital cinema systems from the operational needs of the exhibitor, focusing on areas not addressed by DCI, including access for the visually impaired and hearing impaired, workflow inside the cinema, and equipment interoperability. In particular, NATO's document details requirements for the [[Theatre Management System]] (TMS), the governing software for digital cinema systems within a theatre complex, and provides direction for the development of security key management systems. As with DCI's document, NATO's document is also important to the SMPTE standards effort.\n\n===E-Cinema===\nThe Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ([[SMPTE]]) began work on standards for digital cinema in 2000. It was clear by that point in time that HDTV did not provide a sufficient technological basis for the foundation of digital cinema playback. In Europe, India and Japan however, there is still a significant presence of HDTV for theatrical presentations. Agreements within the ISO standards body have led to these non-compliant systems being referred to as Electronic Cinema Systems (E-Cinema).\n\n==Projectors for digital cinema==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Movie theater]] -->\nOnly four manufacturers make DCI-approved digital cinema projectors; these are [[Sony]], [[Barco NV|Barco]], [[Christie (company)|Christie]] and [[NEC]]. Except for Sony, who use their own SXRD technology, all use the [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (TI). D-Cinema projectors are similar in principle to digital projectors used in industry, education, and domestic home cinemas, but differ in two important respects. First, projectors must conform to the strict performance requirements of the DCI specification. Second, projectors must incorporate anti-piracy devices intended to copyright compliance such as licensing limits. For these reasons all projectors intended to be sold to theaters for screening current release movies ''must'' be approved by the DCI before being put on sale. They now pass through a process called CTP (compliance test plan). Because feature films in digital form are encrypted and the decryption keys (KDMs) are locked to the serial number of the server used (linking to both the projector serial number and server is planned in the future), a system will allow playback of a protected feature only with the required KDM.\n\n===DLP Cinema===\nThree manufacturers have licensed the DLP Cinema technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (TI): [[Christie (company)|Christie Digital Systems]], [[Barco NV|Barco]], and [[NEC]]. While NEC is a relative newcomer to Digital Cinema, Christie is the main player in the U.S. and Barco takes the lead in Europe and Asia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Initially DCI-compliant DLP projectors were available in 2K only, but from early 2012, when TI's 4K DLP chip went into full production, DLP projectors have been available in both 2K and 4K versions. Manufacturers of DLP-based cinema projectors can now also offer 4K upgrades to some of the more recent 2K models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiedigital.co.uk/emea/cinema/cinema-products/digital-cinema-projectors/pages/default.aspx |title=DLP Cinema Projectors&#124;Christie - Visual Display Solutions |publisher=Christiedigital.co.uk |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> Early [[Digital Light Processing|DLP Cinema projectors]], which were deployed primarily in the United States, used limited 1280\u00d71024 resolution or the equivalent of 1.3 MP (megapixels). Digital Projection Incorporated (DPI) designed and sold a few DLP Cinema units (is8-2K) when TI's 2K technology debuted but then abandoned the D-Cinema market while continuing to offer DLP-based projectors for non-cinema purposes. Although based on the same 2K TI \"light engine\" as those of the major players they are so rare as to be virtually unknown in the industry. They are still widely used for pre-show advertising but not usually for feature presentations.\n\nTI's technology is based on the use of digital micromirror devices (DMDs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dlp.com/cinema/dlp-cinema/ |title=What is Digital Cinema \u2013 About Digital Theater - DLP Cinema Technology &#124; DLP \u2013 Texas Instruments |publisher=Dlp.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> These devices are manufactured from silicon using similar technology to that of computer memory chips. The surface of these devices is covered by a very large number of microscopic mirrors, one for each pixel, so a 2K device has about 2.2 million mirrors and a 4K device about 8.8 million. Each mirror vibrates several thousand times a second between two positions: In one, light from the projector's lamp is reflected towards the screen, in the other away from it. The proportion of the time the mirror is in each position varies according to the required brightness of each pixel. Three DMD devices are used, one for each of the primary colors. Light from the lamp, usually a Xenon similar to those used in film projectors with a power between 1&nbsp;kW and 7&nbsp;kW, is split by colored filters into red, green and blue beams which are directed at the appropriate DMD. The 'forward' reflected beam from the three DMMDs is then re-combined and focused by the lens onto the cinema screen.\n\n===Sony SXRD===\nAlone amongst the manufacturers of DCI-compliant cinema projectors Sony decided to develop its own technology rather than use TI's DLP technology. SXRD (Silicon X-tal (Crystal) Reflective Display) projectors have only ever been manufactured in 4K form and, until the launch of the 4K DLP chip by TI, Sony SXRD projectors were the only 4K DCI-compatible projectors on the market. Unlike DLP projectors, however, SXRD projectors do not present the left and right eye images of stereoscopic movies sequentially, instead they use half the available area on the SXRD chip for each eye image. Thus during stereoscopic presentations the SXRD projector functions as a sub 2K projector, the same for HFR 3D Content.<ref>{{cite web|author=SRX-R515P |url=http://www.sony.co.uk/pro/product/dcinemaproj/srx-r515/specifications#specifications |title=SRX-R515P (SRXR515P) : Specifications : United Kingdom : Sony Professional |publisher=Sony.co.uk |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Stereo 3D images===\nIn late 2005, interest in digital 3-D [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] projection led to a new willingness on the part of theaters to co-operate in installing 2K stereo installations to show Disney's ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' in [[3-D film]]. Six more digital 3-D movies were released in 2006 and 2007 (including ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' and ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''). The technology combines a single digital projector fitted with either a polarizing filter (for use with [[polarized glasses]] and silver screens), a filter wheel or an emitter for LCD glasses. ''[[RealD]]'' uses a \"''[[ZScreen]]''\" for polarisation and MasterImage uses a filter wheel that changes the polarity of projector's light output several times per second to alternate quickly the left-and-right-eye views. Another system that uses a filter wheel is [[Dolby 3D]]. The wheel changes the wavelengths of the colours being displayed, and tinted glasses filter these changes so the incorrect wavelength cannot enter the wrong eye. ''[[XpanD 3D|XpanD]]'' makes use of an external emitter that sends a signal to the 3D glasses to block out the wrong image from the wrong eye.\n\n===Laser===\nRGB laser projection for digital cinema: producing the purest [[rec2020|colors]] and the brightest images.<ref>See Binant, ''Introduction to Laser.

To print an 80-minute feature film can cost US$1,500 to $2,500,<ref>Frazer, Bryant. [http://www.studiodaily.com/filmandvideo/currentissue/9520.html Animating a Personal Flash Epic]. ''Studio Daily''. May 22, 2008. Accessed on: May 22, 2008.</ref> so making thousands of prints for a wide-release movie can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, at the maximum 250 megabit-per-second data rate (as defined by [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] for digital cinema), a feature-length movie can be stored on an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] 300&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] hard drive for $50 and a broad release of 4000 'digital prints' might cost $200,000. In addition hard drives can be returned to distributors for reuse. With several hundred movies distributed every year, the industry saves billions of dollars. The digital-cinema roll-out was stalled by the slow pace at which exhibitors acquired digital projectors, since the savings would be seen not by themselves but by distribution companies. The [[Virtual Print Fee]] model was created to address this by passing some of the saving on to the cinemas.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As a consequence of the rapid conversion to digital projection, the number of theatrical releases exhibited on film is dwindling. As of 4 May 2014, 37,711 screens (out of a total of 40,048 screens) in the United States have been converted to digital, 3,013 screens in Canada have been converted, and 79,043 screens internationally have been converted.<ref name=\"natoonline.org\"/>\n\n===Telecommunication===\nRealization and demonstration, on October 29, 2001, of the first digital cinema transmission by [[communications satellite|satellite]] in [[Europe]]<ref>[[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], Commission Sup\u00e9rieure Technique de l'Image et du Son, ''Communiqu\u00e9 de presse'', Paris, October 29th, 2001.</ref><ref>[http://www.passeursdimages.fr/IMG/pdf/projections13.pdf \u00abNum\u00e9rique : le cin\u00e9ma en mutation\u00bb, ''Projections'', '''13''', CNC, Paris, September 2004, p. 7.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JhLwPrW8pggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=olivier+bomsel+mines&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=hKGhUqllpOzSBdulgcgL&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=olivier%20bomsel%20mines&f=false Olivier Bomsel, Gilles Le Blanc, ''Dernier tango argentique.

This began initially with live broadcasts from the New York Metropolitan Opera delivering regular live broadcasts into cinemas and has been widely imitated ever since. Leading territories providing the content are the UK, the USA, France and Germany.  The Royal Opera House, Sydney Opera House, English National Opera and others have found new and returning audiences captivated by the detail offered by a live digital broadcast featuring handheld and cameras on cranes positioned throughout the venue to capture the emotion that might be missed in a live venue situation. In addition these providers all offer additional value during the intervals e.g. interviews with choreographers, cast members, a backstage tour which would not be on offer at the live event itself. Other live events in this field include live theatre from NT Live, Branagh Live, Royal Shakespeare Company, Shakespeare's Globe, the Royal Ballet, Mariinsky Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Berlin Philharmoniker.\n\nIn the last 10 years this initial offering of the arts has also expanded to include live and recorded music events such as Take That Live, One Direction Live, Andre Rieu, live musicals such as the recent Miss Saigon and a record-breaking Billy Elliot Live In Cinemas. Live sport, documentary with a live question and answer element such as the recent Oasis documentary, lectures, faith broadcasts, stand up comedy, museum and gallery exhibitions, TV specials such as the record-breaking ''[[Doctor Who]]'' fiftieth anniversary special ''The Day Of The Doctor'', have all contributed to creating a valuable revenue stream for cinemas large and small all over the world.  Subsequently, live broadcasting, formerly known as Alternative Content, has become known as Event Cinema and a trade association now exists to that end. Ten years on the sector has become a sizeable revenue stream in its own right, earning a loyal following amongst fans of the arts, and the content limited only by the imagination of the producers it would seem. Theatre, ballet, sport, exhibitions, TV specials and documentaries are now established forms of Event Cinema. Worldwide estimations put the likely value of the Event Cinema industry at $1bn by 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eventcinemaassociation.org/assets/eca-screendigestreport2013.pdf | title=Event Cinema in European cinemas | work=IHS Screen Digest | accessdate=September 1, 2016 | type=Report | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513093812/http://www.eventcinemaassociation.org/assets/eca-screendigestreport2013.pdf | archivedate=May 13, 2014 | deadurl=y | year=2013 }}</ref>\n\nEvent Cinema currently accounts for on average between 1-3% of overall box office for cinemas worldwide but anecdotally it's been reported that some cinemas attribute as much as 25%, 48% and even 51% (the Rio Bio cinema in Stockholm) of their overall box office. It is envisaged ultimately that Event Cinema will account for around 5% of the overall box office globally. Event CInema saw 6 worldwide records set and broken over from 2013-15 with notable successes Dr Who ($10.2m in 3 days at the box office - event was also broadcast on terrestrial TV simultaneously), Pompeii Live by the British Museum, Billy Elliot, Andre Rieu, One Direction, Richard III by the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nEvent Cinema is defined more by the frequency of events rather than by the content itself. Event Cinema events typically appear in cinemas during traditionally quieter times in the cinema week such as the Monday-Thursday daytime/evening slot and are characterised by the One Night Only release, followed by one or possibly more 'Encore' releases a few days or weeks later if the event is successful and sold out. On occasion more successful events have returned to cinemas some months or even years later in the case of NT Live where the audience loyalty and company branding is so strong the content owner can be assured of a good showing at the box office.\n\n==Pros and cons==\n\n=== Pros ===\nThe digital formation of sets and locations, especially in the time of growing film series and sequels, is that virtual sets, once computer generated and stored, can be easily revived for future films.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\">{{Cite book|title = Digital Culture: Understanding New Media|last = Creeber|first = Glen|publisher = Open University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-335-22197-4|location = |last2 = Martin|first2 = Royston}}</ref>{{rp|62}}\nConsidering digital film images are documented as data files on hard disk or flash memory, varying systems of edits can be executed with the alteration of a few settings on the editing console with the structure being composed virtually in the computer's memory. A broad choice of effects can be sampled simply and rapidly, without the physical constraints posed by traditional cut-and-stick editing.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|63}} Digital cinema allows national cinemas to construct films specific to their cultures in ways that the more constricting configurations and economics of customary film-making prevented. Low-cost cameras and computer-based editing software have gradually enabled films to be produced for minimal cost. The ability of digital cameras to allow film-makers to shoot limitless footage without wasting pricey celluloid has transformed film production in some Third World countries.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Digital Culture: Understanding New Media|last = Creeber|first = Glen|publisher = Open University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-335-22197-4|location = |pages = 66|last2 = Martin|first2 = Royston.}}</ref> From consumers' perspective digital prints don't deteriorate with the number of showings. Unlike celluloid film, there is no projection mechanism or manual handling to add scratches or other physically generated artefacts. Provincial cinemas that would have received old prints can give consumers the same cinematographic experience (all other things being equal) as those attending the premiere.\n\n=== Cons ===\nA number of high-profile film directors, including [[Christopher Nolan]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Merchan |first=George |url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/christopher-nolan-discusses-why-he-prefers-film-to-digital-his-approach-to-cgi-and-much-more |title=Christopher Nolan talks film vs. digital, his take on CGI, his disinterest in 3D, and much more in insightful DGA interview - Movie News |publisher=JoBlo.com |date=2012-04-15}}</ref> [[Paul Thomas Anderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=7npmu9Ge_OY |title=pta on digital vs. film |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-08-10}}</ref> [[David O.

Each pixel has greater detail per frame.\n\nOwing to the smaller dynamic range of digital cameras, correcting poor digital exposures is more difficult than correcting poor film exposures during post-production. A partial solution to this problem is to add complex video-assist technology during the shooting process. However, such technologies are typically available only to high-budget production companies.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|62}} Digital cinemas' efficiency of storing images has a downside. The speed and ease of modern digital editing processes threatens to give editors and their directors, if not an embarrassment of choice then at least a confusion of options, potentially making the editing process, with this 'try it and see' philosophy, lengthier rather than shorter.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|63}} Because the equipment needed to produce digital feature films can be obtained more easily than celluloid, producers could inundate the market with cheap productions and potentially dominate the efforts of serious directors. Because of the quick speed in which they are filmed, these stories sometimes lack essential narrative structure.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|66\u201367}}\n\nThe projectors used for celluloid film were largely the same technology as when film/movies were invented over 100 years ago. The evolutions of adding sound and wide screen could largely be accommodated by bolting on sound decoders, and changing lenses. This well proven and understood technology had several advantages 1) The life of a mechanical projector of around 35 years 2) a mean time between failures ([[mean time between failures|MTBF]]) of 15 years and 3) an average repair time of 15 minutes (often done by the projectionist). On the other hand, digital projectors are around 10 times more expensive, have a much shorter life expectancy due to the developing technology (already technology has moved from 2K to 4K) so the pace of obsolescence is higher. The MTBF has not yet been established, but the ability for the projectionist to effect a quick repair has gone.\n\n===Costs===\n\n==== Pros ====\nThe electronic transferring of digital film, from central servers to servers in cinema projection booths, is an inexpensive process of supplying copies of newest releases to the vast number of cinema screens demanded by prevailing saturation-release strategies. There is a significant saving on print expenses in such cases: at a minimum cost per print of $1200\u20132000, the cost of celluloid print production is between $5\u20138 million per film. With several thousand releases a year, the probable savings offered by digital distribution and projection are over $1 billion.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|67}} The cost savings and ease, together with the ability to store film rather than having to send a print on to the next cinema, allows a larger scope of films to be screened and watched by the public; minority and small-budget films that would not otherwise get such a chance.<ref name=\"Creeber 2009\"/>{{rp|67}}\n\n==== Cons ====\nThe initial costs for converting theaters to digital are high: $100,000 per screen, on average. Theaters have been reluctant to switch without a cost-sharing arrangement with [[film distributor]]s. A solution is a temporary ''[[Virtual Print Fee]]'' system, where the distributor (who saves the money of producing and transporting a film print) pays a fee per copy to help finance the digital systems of the theaters.<ref>{{cite web|author=AAM VPF |url=http://www.artsalliancemedia.com/services/finance |title=AAM VPF |publisher=AAM |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> A theater can purchase a film projector for as little as $10,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Westar-CFEC-105X-35mm-Projection-System-NEW-UNUSED-/250750810837 |title=Westar Cfec 105 x 35 mm Projection System New Unused |publisher=eBay |date=2012-04-17}}</ref> (though projectors intended for commercial cinemas cost two to three times that; to which must be added the cost of a [[Single reel|long-play system]], which also costs around $10,000, making a total of around $30,000\u2013$40,000) from which they could expect an average life of 30\u201340 years.

(In Britain the cost of an entry level projector including server, installation, etc., would be \u00a331,000 [$50,000].)\n\nArchiving [[digital master]]s has also turned out to be both tricky and costly. In a 2007 study, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] found the cost of long-term storage of 4K digital masters to be \"enormously higher\u2014up to 11 times that of the cost of storing film masters.\" This is because of the limited or uncertain lifespan of digital storage: No current digital medium\u2014be it [[optical disc]], magnetic [[hard drive]] or digital tape\u2014can reliably store a motion picture for as long as a hundred years or more (something that film\u2014properly stored and handled\u2014does very well).<ref name=\"digital_dilemma\">{{Cite journal | title = The Digital Dilemma.

It has traditionally been associated with strong advocacy of [[human rights]], [[anti-communism]] and a distinct [[Taiwanese identity]]. The current leader is President [[Tsai Ing-wen]], the second member of the DPP to hold the office.<ref name=\"chinapost.com.tw\">[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/presidential-election/2012/01/14/329044/Tsai-steps.htm \"Tsai steps down as DPP chair after defeat in presidential poll\"] (14 January 2012). ''The China Post''. Retrieved 6 April 2018.</ref>\n\nThe DPP is a long-term member of [[Liberal International]] and a founding member of the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]]. It represented Taiwan in the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. The DPP and its affiliated parties are widely classified as socially liberal because of their strong support for human rights,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but they also advocate [[economic liberalism]] and a [[Taiwanese nationalism|nationalistic]] identity. In addition, the DPP is more willing to increase military expenditures, with a strong pro-US foreign policy.\n\n==History==\nThe DPP's roots were in opposition to [[Kuomintang]] [[One-party state|one-party authoritarian rule]]. It was founded as the [[Tangwai]] \u2013 or \"outside-the-KMT\" \u2013 movement. This movement culminated in the formation of the DPP as an alternative party on 28 September 1986 when eighteen founding members met at [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel Taipei]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lu|first1=Lu Hsin-hui|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=DPP should clarify its cross-strait policy: founding member|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201609280026.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=28 September 2016}}</ref> A total of 132 people joined the party that day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Li-hua|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=DPP members say party must discuss core values|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/09/30/2003656223|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> The new party contested the [[Republic of China's legislative election, 1986|1986 election]] even though competing parties remained illegal under national law until the following year. The first members of the party drew heavily from the ranks of family members and defense lawyers of political prisoners as well as intellectuals and artists who had spent time abroad. Such individuals were strongly committed to political change that would ensure constitutional support in Republic of China's for freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. The party did not at the outset give open support to an independent Republic of China's national identity\u2013a move that could have invited a violent crackdown by the Republic of China's Kuomintang rulers. Its platform was pro-environment and pro-democracy. As more and more of its demands were met during the 1990s\u2013such as the direct popular election of Republic of China's [[president of the Republic of China|president]] and all representatives in its [[Legislative Yuan]], and open discussion of Republic of China's repressive past as represented in the [[February 28 Incident]] and its long [[martial law]] aftermath\u2013a greater variety of views could be advocated in the more liberal political atmosphere. Party members began openly promoting a national identity for Republic of China separate from that of China. The DPP supported reform of the Constitution that would make it official that Republic of China's national government represented only the people of Republic of China and made no claims to territory in [[mainland China]] or [[Mongolia]].\n\nOnce the DPP had representation in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (LY, or Parliament), the party used the legislature as a forum to challenge the government. However, it did not emerge as a formidable force until 1991, when the elderly LY members elected from the mainland provinces in 1948 retired. Fears that the DPP would one day take control of the legislature led then-President [[Lee Teng-hui]] to push through a series of amendments to strengthen presidential power (for example, Republic of China's [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]] would no longer have to be confirmed by the Legislative Yuan).\n\n===2000\u20132008: in minority government===\n[[File:Chen Shui-bian from VOA.jpg|thumb|right|Former President Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP president (2000-2008)]]\n[[File:DPP-Taiwan-old.svg|thumb|right|Old DPP logo]]\nThe DPP won the presidency with the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2000|election]] of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in March 2000 with a plurality, due to [[Pan-Blue]] voters splitting their vote between the Kuomintang and independent candidate [[James Soong]], ending more than half a century of KMT rule in Republic of China. Chen softened the party's stance on independence to appeal to moderate voters, appease the United States and placate China. He also promised not to [[Four Noes and One Without|change the ROC state symbols or declare formal independence]] as long as the [[China|People's Republic of China]] did not attack Taiwan.\n\nThe DPP became the largest party having reached a plurality in the Legislative Yuan for the first time in 2002 following the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2001|2001 legislative election]]. However, a majority coalition between the KMT, [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] prevented it from taking control of the chamber.\n\nIn 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow margin. He and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] had been involved in an assassination attempt only hours before the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|election]]. The KMT candidate, [[Lien Chan]], demanded a recount the following morning. A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on 10 May 2004 and ended on 18 May 2004. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team had seven members \u2013 one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff (Pan-Blue Coalition) and the defendant (Pan-Green Coalition). Disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, President Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 as opposed to 29,518 originally). In the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2004|later legislative election]], the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] opposition retained control of the chamber.\n\nThe DPP suffered a significant election defeat in nationwide [[Chinese local elections, 2005|local and county elections in December 2005]]. The pan-blue coalition captured 16 of 23 county and city government offices under the leadership of popular [[Taipei]] mayor and KMT Party Chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]].\n\nThe results led to a shake up of the party leadership. [[Su Tseng-chang]] resigned as DPP chairman soon after election results were announced. Su had pledged to step down if the DPP lost either Taipei County or failed to win 10 of the 23 mayor/magistrate positions. Vice President [[Annette Lu]] was appointed acting DPP leader. Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was elected in a [[Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election, 2006|three-way race]] against legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] and [[Wong Chin-chu]] with 54.4% of the vote.\n\nPremier [[Frank Hsieh]], DPP election organizer and former mayor of [[Kaohsiung]] twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until 17 January 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Su) to the departing premier, but Hsieh declined and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line on dealing with China.\n\n===Separate identity===\nOn 30 September 2007, Republic of China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"normal nation\". It struck an accommodating tone by advocating general use of \"[[Republic of China]]\" as the country's name without calling for abandonment of the name Republic of China.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm AP, Republic of China Party Asserts Separate Identity]</ref>\n\n===2008\u20132016: in opposition===\nIn the national elections held in early months of 2008 the DPP won less than 25% of the seats (38.2% vote share) in the new [[Legislative Yuan]] while its presidential candidate, former [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Frank Hsieh]], lost to KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] by a wide margin (41.55% vs. 58.45%).\n\nThe first months after the election were dominated by press coverage of the travails of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and his wife [[Wu Shu-jen]]. On 15 August 2008 Chen resigned from the Democratic Progressive Party and apologized thus: \"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\" DPP Chairwoman [[Tsai Ing-wen]] followed with a public statement on behalf of the party: \"In regard to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party's anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\"<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/17/former-taiwan-president-resigns-from-party-over-corruption-charges pacificmagazine.net, Former Republic of China President Resigns From Party Over Corruption Charges]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe DPP vowed to reflect on public misgivings towards the party.

The DPP marked the anniversary with massive rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung. Tsai's address to the crowd in Taipei on May 17 proclaimed a \"citizens' movement to protect Republic of China\" seeking to \"protect our democracy and protect Republic of China.\"<ref>[http://dpptaiwan.wordpress.com/2009/05/17/tsai-ing-wens-opening-speech-at-the-517-rally/]</ref>\n\n=== 2016: in majority government ===\nOn 16 January 2016, Republic of China held a general election for its presidency and for the Legislative Yuan.

Furthermore, its platform includes a legal and political order based on human rights and democracy; balanced economic and financial administration; fair and open social welfare; educational and cultural reform; independent defence and peaceful foreign policy. For these reasons, it used to be considered a party of the [[centre-left]] economically, and its base consisted largely of the working class; however, the majority of its policies are now [[Centrism|centrist]] in nature.\n\nThe primary political axis in Taiwan involves the issue of [[Taiwan independence]] versus eventual [[Cross-Strait Unification|unification with China]]. Although the differences tend to be portrayed in polarized terms, both major coalitions have developed modified, nuanced and often complex positions. Though opposed in the philosophical origins, the practical differences between such positions can sometimes be subtle.\n\nThe current official position of the party is that the \"Republic of China ([[Taiwan]])\" is an independent and sovereign country whose territory consists of Taiwan and its surrounding smaller islands and whose sovereignty derives only from the ROC citizens living in Taiwan (similar philosophy of [[self-determination]]), based on the \"[[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]]\" in 1999. It considers [[Taiwan independence]] to be a current fact, making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. The DPP rejects the so-called \"[[One China principle]]\" defined in 1992 as the basis for official diplomatic relations with the [[mainland China]] (PRC) and advocates a Taiwanese national identity which is separate from mainland China. The DPP argues that its efforts to promote a Taiwanese national identity are merely an effort to normalize a Taiwanese identity repressed during years of authoritarian Kuomintang rule. Democratic Progressive Party also differs from the KMT on foreign and defense policies in that the DPP considers  relations with the United States, Japan, and European states, among other democratic countries, are crucial for Taiwan's security.\n\nIn contrast, the KMT or [[pan-blue coalition]] agrees that the Republic of China is an independent and sovereign country that is not part of the PRC, but argues that a [[one China principle]] (with different definitions across the strait) can be used as the basis for talks with China. The KMT also opposes the purposes of Taiwan independence and argues that efforts to establish a Taiwanese national identity separated from the Chinese national identity are unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Some KMT conservative officials have called efforts from DPP \"[[anti-China]]\" and \"[[racist]]\" (e.g., opposing the immigrants from mainland China, whom DPP officials did not recognize as Taiwanese, but Chinese). At the other end of the political spectrum, the acceptance by the DPP of the symbols of the Republic of China is opposed by the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\nThe first years of the DPP as the ruling party drew accusations from the opposition that, as a self-styled Taiwanese [[nationalism|nationalist]] party, the DPP was itself inadequately sensitive to the ethnographic diversity of Taiwan's population. Where the KMT had been guilty of Chinese [[chauvinism]], the critics charged, the DPP might offer nothing more as a remedy than [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] chauvinism.\n\nChina has maintained a hostile position toward the DPP. It has made some efforts to moderate its tone since passing its [[Anti-Secession Law]] in 2005 to prevent a popular backlash from Taiwan's voters. In 2008 China stated it was willing to negotiate with any party in Taiwan that \"accepts the so-called [[1992 consensus]]\" (The consensus agreed by KMT and CPC, which KMT described as one China principle with different definitions across the strait, CPC first recognized until 2008). The DPP denies the existence of the [[1992 consensus]] between China and Taiwan and demand a greater democratic opening of Communist China.\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities effective KMT networks contribute to Aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the Aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the \"indigenization\" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's \"rectification\" by recognizing the Truku for political reasons, where the Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0t_CU9gmi8cC&pg=PA220&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false ed.

They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as '''devil's trumpets''',<ref>{{Cite web|title = Datura metel|url = https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/datura-metel/|website = plants.ces.ncsu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> not to be confused with angel's trumpets, its closely related genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''. They are also sometimes called '''moonflowers''', '''jimsonweed''', '''devil's weed''', '''hell's bells''', '''thorn-apple''', and many more. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalization]] throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the [[Americas]] and [[North Africa]], however, is most likely restricted to the United States, Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and [[Tunisia]] in Africa where the highest species diversity occurs.\n\nAll species of ''Datura'' are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers.\n\nSome [[South America]]n plants formerly thought of as ''Datura'' are now treated as belonging to the distinct genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''<ref>{{cite book | editor = Hawkes, J.

Record of this name in English dates back to 1662.<ref>the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' or [[OED]]</ref> [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] refers to one type in ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' as ''apple-Peru''. In Mexico, its common name is ''toloache''.\n\n==Description==\n''Datura'' species are [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], leafy [[annual plant|annuals]] and short-lived [[perennial plant|perennials]] which can reach up to 2 m in height. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 10\u201320&nbsp;cm long and 5\u201318&nbsp;cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of ''Brugmansia''), trumpet-shaped, 5\u201320&nbsp;cm long and 4\u201312&nbsp;cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The [[fruit]] is a spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 4\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20136&nbsp;cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous [[seed]]s. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.\n\n''Datura'' belongs to the classic \"witches' weeds\", along with [[deadly nightshade]], [[henbane]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]]. Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of potions and witches' brews.<ref name=\"Preissel\"/>\n\nIn India it has been referred to as \"Poisonous\" and as an [[aphrodisiac]]. In little measures it was used in [[Ayurveda]] as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to [[Shiva]]. It is also used in [[Ganesh Chaturthi]].\n\nThe [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including ''[[Hypercompe|Hypercompe indecisa]]'', eat some ''Datura'' species.\n\n==Species and cultivars==\n[[File:Datura FR 2012.jpg|thumb|''Datura metel'']]\nIt is difficult to classify ''Datura'' as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these \"new species\" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as ''D. wrightii'' and ''D. inoxia'', are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, ''Datura'' species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location.

Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so anaerobic organic enrichment such as anaerobically composted organic matter or manure, should be avoided.<ref name=\"Preissel\"/>\n\n==Toxicity==\nAll ''Datura'' plants contain [[tropane alkaloids]] such as [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[atropine]], primarily in their seeds and flowers. Because of the presence of these substances, ''Datura'' has been used for centuries in some cultures as a [[poison]].<ref name=\"Preissel\"/><ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Adams, J. D.

In other words, ''G''/''N'' is abelian [[if and only if]] ''N'' contains the commutator subgroup. So in some sense it provides a measure of how far the group is from being abelian; the larger the commutator subgroup is, the \"less abelian\" the group is.\n\n== Commutators ==\n{{main|Commutator}}\nFor elements ''g'' and ''h'' of a group ''G'', the [[commutator]] of ''g'' and ''h'' is <math> [g,h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh </math>.  The commutator <math> [g,h] </math>  is equal to the identity element ''e'' if and only if <math> gh = hg </math> , that is, if and only if ''g'' and ''h'' commute.  In general, <math> gh = hg[g,h]</math>.\n\nHowever, the notation is somewhat arbitrary and there is a non-equivalent variant definition for the commutator that has the inverses on the right hand side of the equation: <math>[g,h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1} </math> in which case  <math> gh\\neq hg[g,h]</math> but instead <math> gh = [g,h]hg</math>.\n\nAn element of ''G'' which is of the form <math> [g,h] </math> for some ''g'' and ''h'' is called a commutator.  The identity element ''e'' = [''e'',''e''] is always a commutator, and it is the only commutator if and only if ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]].\n\nHere are some simple but useful commutator identities, true for any elements ''s'', ''g'', ''h'' of a group ''G'':\n\n* <math>[g,h]^{-1} = [h,g].</math>\n* <math>[g,h]^s = [g^s,h^s]</math>, where <math>g^s = s^{-1}gs</math> (or, respectively, <math> g^s = sgs^{-1}</math>), the [[commutator#Identities|conjugate]] of <math>g</math> by <math>s</math>.\n* For any homomorphism <math> f: G\\to H </math>, <math> f([g, h]) = [f(g), f(h)]</math>.\n\nThe first and second identities imply that the set of commutators in ''G'' is closed under inversion and conjugation.  If in the third identity we take ''H'' = ''G'', we get that the set of commutators is stable under any endomorphism of ''G''.  This is in fact a generalization of the second identity, since we can take ''f'' to be the conjugation automorphism on ''G'', <math> x \\mapsto x^s </math>, to get the second identity.\n\nHowever, the product of two or more commutators need not be a commutator.  A generic example is [''a'',''b''][''c'',''d''] in the [[free group]] on ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d''.  It is known that the least order of a finite group for which there exists two commutators whose product is not a commutator is 96; in fact there are two nonisomorphic groups of order 96 with this property.<ref>{{harvtxt|Su\u00e1rez-Alvarez}}</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\nThis motivates the definition of the '''commutator subgroup''' <math>[G, G] </math> (also called the '''derived subgroup''', and denoted <math>G'</math> or <math>G^{(1)} </math>) of ''G'': it is the subgroup [[generating set of a group|generated]] by all the commutators.\n\nIt follows from the properties of commutators that any element of <math>[G, G] </math> is of the form\n\n:<math>[g_1,h_1] \\cdots [g_n,h_n] </math>\n\nfor some natural number <math>n </math>, where the ''g''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> are elements of ''G''.  Moreover, since <math> ([g_1,h_1] \\cdots [g_n,h_n])^s = [g_1^s,h_1^s] \\cdots [g_n^s,h_n^s]</math>, the commutator subgroup is normal in ''G''.  For any homomorphism ''f'': ''G'' \u2192 ''H'',\n\n:<math> f([g_1,h_1] \\cdots [g_n,h_n]) = [f(g_1),f(h_1)] \\cdots [f(g_n),f(h_n)] </math>,\n\nso that <math>f([G,G]) \\leq [H,H]</math>.\n\nThis shows that the commutator subgroup can be viewed as a [[functor]] on the category of groups, some implications of which are explored below.  Moreover, taking ''G'' = ''H'' it shows that the commutator subgroup is stable under every endomorphism of ''G'': that is, [''G'',''G''] is a [[fully characteristic subgroup]] of ''G'', a property which is considerably stronger than normality.\n\nThe commutator subgroup can also be defined as the set of elements ''g'' of the group which have an expression as a product ''g'' = ''g''<sub>1</sub> ''g''<sub>2</sub> ... ''g<sub>k</sub>'' that can be rearranged to give the identity.\n\n=== Derived series ===\nThis construction can be iterated:\n:<math>G^{(0)} := G</math>\n:<math>G^{(n)} := [G^{(n-1)},G^{(n-1)}] \\quad n \\in \\mathbf{N}</math>\nThe groups <math>G^{(2)}, G^{(3)}, \\ldots</math> are called the '''second derived subgroup''', '''third derived subgroup''', and so forth, and the descending [[normal series]]\n:<math>\\cdots \\triangleleft G^{(2)} \\triangleleft G^{(1)} \\triangleleft G^{(0)} = G</math>\nis called the '''derived series'''. This should not be confused with the '''[[lower central series]]''', whose terms are <math>G_n := [G_{n-1},G]</math>.\n\nFor a finite group, the derived series terminates in a [[perfect group]], which may or may not be trivial. For an infinite group, the derived series need not terminate at a finite stage, and one can continue it to infinite [[ordinal number]]s via [[transfinite recursion]], thereby obtaining the '''transfinite derived series''', which eventually terminates at the [[perfect core]] of the group.\n\n=== Abelianization ===\nGiven a group <math>G</math>, a [[quotient group]] <math>G/N</math> is abelian if and only if <math>[G, G]\\leq N</math>.\n\nThe quotient <math>G/[G, G]</math> is an abelian group called the '''abelianization''' of <math>G</math> or <math>G</math> '''made abelian'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=108}}</ref> It is usually denoted by <math>G^{\\operatorname{ab}}</math> or <math>G_{\\operatorname{ab}}</math>.\n\nThere is a useful categorical interpretation of the map <math>\\varphi: G \\rightarrow G^{\\operatorname{ab}}</math>.  Namely <math>\\varphi</math> is universal for homomorphisms from <math>G</math> to an abelian group <math>H</math>: for any abelian group <math>H</math> and homomorphism of groups <math>f: G \\to H</math> there exists a unique homomorphism <math>F: G^{\\operatorname{ab}}\\to H</math> such that <math>f = F \\circ \\varphi</math>.  As usual for objects defined by universal mapping properties, this shows the uniqueness of the abelianization ''G''<sup>ab</sup> up to canonical isomorphism, whereas the explicit construction <math>G\\to G/[G, G]</math> shows existence.\n\nThe abelianization functor is the [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]] of the inclusion functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of groups. The existence of the abelianization functor '''Grp''' \u2192 '''Ab''' makes the category Ab a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of groups, defined as a full subcategory whose inclusion functor has a left adjoint. \n\nAnother important interpretation of <math>G^{\\operatorname{ab}}</math> is as <math>H_1(G, \\mathbb{Z})</math>, the first [[group homology|homology group]] of <math>G</math> with integral coefficients.\n\n=== Classes of groups ===\nA group ''G'' is an '''[[abelian group]]''' if and only if the derived group is trivial: [''G'',''G''] = {''e''}. Equivalently, if and only if the group equals its abelianization. See above for the definition of a group's abelianization.\n\nA group ''G'' is a '''[[perfect group]]''' if and only if the derived group equals the group itself: [''G'',''G''] = ''G''.

He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for [[advertising campaign]]s, most notably for [[FLIT]] and [[Standard Oil]], and as a [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoonist]] for the New York newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''. He published his first children's book ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' in 1937. During [[World War II]], he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he also worked in the animation and film department of the [[United States Army]] where he wrote, produced or animated many productions \u2013 both live-action and animated \u2013 including ''[[Design for Death]]'', which later won the 1947 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Seuss-Geisel \"Theodor Seuss Geisel\"] (2015).

It spawned a song and was used as a punch line for comedians such as [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]]. As Geisel gained notoriety for the FLIT campaign, his work was in demand and began to appear regularly in magazines such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.\n\nGeisel supported himself and his wife through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] by drawing advertising for [[General Electric]], [[NBC]], [[Standard Oil]], [[Narragansett Brewing Company]], and many other companies. In 1935, he wrote and drew a short-lived comic strip called ''[[Hejji]]''.<ref name=lambiek-seuss>{{cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Dr. Seuss|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/seuss_dr.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe increased income allowed the Geisels to move to better quarters and to socialize in higher social circles.<ref>Pease (2010), p. 49</ref> They became friends with the wealthy family of banker [[Frank A.

This was followed by ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.\n\n===Essomarine===\nGeisel gained a significant public profile through a program for motor boat lubricants produced by Standard Oil under the brand name Essomarine.<ref>[http://aoghs.org/editors-picks/seuss-the-oilman/ \"Seuss I am, an Oilman,\" website of American Oil & Gas Historical Society]</ref> He later recounted that [[Harry Bruno]], Ted Cook, and Verne Carrier worked with him at the National Motor Boat Show on exhibits referred to as the Seuss Navy.<ref>EC Lantham, ''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine'', April 1976, p. 20.</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Geisel produced a 30-page booklet titled ''Secrets of the Deep'' which was available by mail after June. At the January [[boat show]] for 1935, visitors filled out order cards to receive ''Secrets''. Geisel drew up a Certificate of Commission for visitors in 1936. A mock ship deck called SS ''Essomarine'' provided the scene where photos of \"Admirals\" were taken. That summer, Geisel released a second volume of ''Secrets''. For the 1937 show, he sculpted Marine Muggs and designed a flag for the Seuss Navy.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe following year featured \"Little Dramas of the Deep\", a six-act play with ten characters. According to Geisel's sister, \"He plans the whole show with scenery and action and then, standing in a realistic [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]], reels off a speech which combines advertising with humor.\" For 1939, exhibitors made available the Nuzzlepuss [[ashtray]] and illustrated tide-table calendars.\n\nA Seuss Navy Luncheon was held on January 11, 1940, at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. At that year's boat show, Geisel provided the Navigamarama exhibit and the ''Sea Lawyers Gazette''.\n\nThe final contribution to the Essomarine project was the [[mermaid]] Essie Neptune and her pet whale in 1941.

Then, in 1943, he joined the Army as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] and was commander of the Animation Department of the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], where he wrote films that included ''[[Your Job in Germany]]'', a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; ''[[Our Job in Japan]]''; and the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of adult army training films.

He published most of his books through [[Random House]] in North America and [[William Collins, Sons]] (later [[HarperCollins]]) internationally. He wrote many, including such favorites as ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1955), ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956), ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' (1957), ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (1957), and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the [[Caldecott Medal]] nor the [[Newbery Medal]]. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''Bartholomew and the Oobleck'' (1949), and ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the [[musical film|musical]] and [[fantasy film]] ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.]]'', which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in ''[[Redbook]]'' Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as ''The Sneetches and Other Stories'') or reworked into independent books (''If I Ran the Zoo''). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.\n\nIn May 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a report on [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin]] (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize. He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book using only those words.<ref name=\"new yorker 1960\">{{cite web |title= Profiles: Children's Friend |last=Kahn, Jr. |first=E.J. |authorlink=Ely Jacques Kahn, Jr. |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1960-12-17#folio=046 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast|Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]] |date=December 17, 1960 |access-date=September 20, 2008 }}</ref> Spaulding challenged Geisel to \"bring back a book children can't put down\".<ref name=\"new yorker 2002\">{{cite web |title=Cat People: What Dr. Seuss Really Taught Us |last=Menand |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Menand |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/12/23/021223crat_atlarge?currentPage=all |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast|Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications]] |date=December 23, 2002 |access-date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref> Nine months later, Geisel completed ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'', using 236 of the words given to him.

Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final weak position in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and feminine rhymes.\n\nGeisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for longer stretches typically mixed it with [[iambic tetrameter]], which consists of a weak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to write. Thus, for example, the magicians in ''[[Bartholomew and the Oobleck]]'' make their first appearance chanting in [[trochee]]s (thus resembling the witches of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]''):\n\n{{quote|'''Shuff'''le, '''duff'''le, '''muzz'''le, '''muff'''}}\n\nThey then switch to [[Iamb (poetry)|iambs]] for the oobleck spell:\n\n{{poemquote|Go '''make''' the '''Oob'''leck '''tum'''ble '''down'''\nOn '''ev'''ery '''street''', in '''ev'''ery '''town'''!<ref>{{cite book |title=Bartholomew and the Oobleck |author=Dr. Seuss |year=1949 |publisher=[[Random House]] |oclc=391115 |pages= }}</ref>}}\n\n==Artwork==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--first part of section has no references-->\n[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Geisel at work on a drawing of the [[Grinch]] for ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' in 1957]]\n\nGeisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or [[watercolor]]s, but in his children's books of the postwar period, he generally made use of a starker medium\u2014pen and ink\u2014normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as ''[[The Lorax]],'' used more colors.\n\nGeisel's style was unique \u2013 his figures are often \"rounded\" and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of [[The grinch]] and [[the Cat in the Hat]]. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy [[steam calliope]].\n\nGeisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects. His endlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the ''Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count'', from ''[[Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book]]'', or the \"most peculiar machine\" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in ''[[The Sneetches]]''. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of ''[[Bartholomew Cubbins]]'', the tail of ''[[Gertrude McFuzz]]'', and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish''.\n\nGeisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of \"voil\u00e0\" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish'' when he creates fish (who perform the gesture with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of ''If I Ran the Circus'', and in the introduction of the \"Little Cats\" in ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.\n\nGeisel also follows the [[cartoon]] tradition of showing [[motion lines|motion with lines]], like in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in ''If I Ran the Circus''. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses\u2014sight, smell, and hearing\u2014in ''The Big Brag,'' and lines even illustrate \"thought\", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.\n\n===Recurring images===\nGeisel's early work in advertising and [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]] helped him to produce \"sketches\" of things that received more perfect realization later in his children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image later on was quite different from the original.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mandeville Special Collections Library, UC San Diego|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|publisher=UC San Diego|access-date=April 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512120300/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/seusscoll.html|archive-date=May 12, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Here are some examples:\n* An editorial cartoon from July 16, 1941<ref name=isolationist-pic>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Dr. Seuss|story=The Isolationist|title=PM|date=July 16, 1941|url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|accessdate=April 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417213611/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dspolitic/pm/10716cs.jpg|archivedate=April 17, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> depicts a whale resting on the top of a mountain as a [[parody]] of American [[isolationism|isolationists]], especially [[Charles Lindbergh]].

However, he did permit the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience during World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.\n\nThe first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'', animated at [[Warner Bros.]] in 1942 and directed by [[Bob Clampett]]. It was presented as part of the [[Merrie Melodies]] series and included a number of gags not present in the original narrative, including a fish committing suicide and a [[Katharine Hepburn]] imitation by Mayzie.\n\nAs part of the Puppetoon theatrical cartoon series for [[Paramount Pictures]], two of Geisel's works were adapted into stop-motion films by George Pal. The first, \"[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]\", was released in 1943<ref>{{cite web |title=The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035602/ |website=IMDB |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> and nominated for an Academy Award for \"Short Subject (Cartoon)\" the following year.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 16th Academy Awards (1944)  |url= https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1944 |access-date=March 3, 2017 |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715164124/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1944 |archivedate= July 15, 2015 |df= }}</ref> The second, \"[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street#film|And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]\", with a title slightly altered from [[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street|the book's]], was released in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Cartoon Database |url= https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36555-And-To-Think-I-Saw-It-On-Mulberry-Street |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Geisel authorized [[Revell]], the well-known plastic model-making company, to make a series of \"animals\" that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled \"in thousands\" of ways. The series was called the \"Dr. Seuss Zoo\" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a \"Gift Set\" as well as individually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together \"beginner's kit\" of The Cat in the Hat.\n\nIn 1966, Geisel authorized eminent cartoon artist [[Chuck Jones]]&nbsp;\u2013 his friend and former colleague from the war&nbsp;\u2013 to make a cartoon version of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' Geisel was credited as a co-producer under his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by [[Boris Karloff]], who also provided the voice of the Grinch. It was very faithful to the original book, and is considered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual [[Christmas television special]]. Jones directed an adaptation of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' in 1970 and produced an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' in 1971.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials that were produced by [[DePatie-Freleng]]: ''[[The Lorax (TV special)|The Lorax]]'' (1972); ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'' (1973); ''[[The Hoober-Bloob Highway]]'' (1975); ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (1977); ''[[Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?]]'' (1980); and ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'' (1982). Several of the specials won multiple [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards.\n\nA Soviet [[Paint-on-glass animation|paint-on-glass-animated]] short film was made in 1986 called ''[[Welcome (1986 film)|Welcome]]'', an adaptation of ''Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose''. The last adaptation of Geisel's work before he died was ''[[The Butter Battle Book]]'', a television special based on the book of the same name, directed by adult animation legend [[Ralph Bakshi]].\n\nA television film titled ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'' was released in 1994, which adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions and animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the animated portions were merely edited versions of previous animated television specials and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well.\n\nAfter Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel was placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action feature-film version of ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]], as well as a Seuss-themed [[Broadway theater|Broadway musical]] called ''[[Seussical]]'', and both premiered in 2000. ''The Grinch'' has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas season, after premiering in 1998 (under the title ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'') at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003, another live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' that featured [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as the title character. Audrey Geisel has spoken critically of the film, especially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she would not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.<ref>[[Associated Press]] (February 26, 2004).

A second CGI-animated feature film adaptation of ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'' was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] on March 2, 2012 (on what would have been Seuss's 108th birthday). A third CGI-animated feature film adaptation of ''[[The Grinch (film)|The Grinch]]'' will be released by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] on November 9, 2018.\n\nFour television series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first, ''Gerald McBoing-Boing'', was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's 1951 cartoon [[Gerald McBoing-Boing|of the same name]] and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', was a mix of live-action and puppetry by [[Jim Henson Television]], the producers of [[The Muppets]]. It aired for one season on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States, from 1996 to 1997.

It is the digital analogue of optical film [[compositing]].\n\n==Mathematics==\nThe basic operation used in digital compositing is known as '[[alpha compositing#Alpha blending|alpha blending]]', where an opacity value, '\u03b1', is used to control the proportions of two input [[pixel]] values that end up a single output pixel.\n\nAs a simple example, suppose two images of the same size are available and they are to be composited. The input images are referred to as the foreground image and the background image. Each image consists of the same number of [[pixel]]s. Compositing is performed by mathematically combining information from the corresponding pixels from the two input images and recording the result in a third image, which is called the composited image.\n\nConsider three pixels;\n* a foreground pixel, f\n* a background pixel, b\n* a composited pixel, c\nand \n* \u03b1, the opacity value of the foreground pixel. (\u03b1 = 1 for opaque foreground, \u03b1 = 0 for a completely transparent foreground). A monochrome raster image where the pixel values are to be interpreted as alpha values is known as a [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]].\n\nThen, considering all three colour channels, and assuming that the colour channels are expressed in a \u03b3=1 colour space (that is to say, the measured values are proportional to light intensity), we have:\n\n:c<sub>r</sub> = \u03b1 f<sub>r</sub> + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) b<sub>r</sub>\n:c<sub>g</sub> = \u03b1 f<sub>g</sub> + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) b<sub>g</sub>\n:c<sub>b</sub> = \u03b1 f<sub>b</sub> + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) b<sub>b</sub>\n\nNote that if the operations are performed in a colour space where \u03b3 is not equal to 1 then the operation will lead to non-linear effects which can potentially be seen as [[aliasing]] artifacts (or '[[jaggies]]') along sharp edges in the matte.  More generally, nonlinear compositing can have effects such as \"halos\" around composited objects, because the influence of the alpha channel is non-linear.  It is possible for a compositing artist to compensate for the effects of compositing in non-linear space.\n\nPerforming alpha blending is an expensive operation if performed on an entire image or 3D scene. If this operation has to be done in real time video games there is an easy trick to boost performance.\n\n:c<sub>out</sub> = \u03b1 f<sub>in</sub> + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) b<sub>in</sub>\n:c<sub>out</sub> = \u03b1 f<sub>in</sub> + b<sub>in</sub> \u2212 \u03b1 b<sub>in</sub>\n:c<sub>out</sub> = b<sub>in</sub> + \u03b1 (f<sub>in</sub> \u2212 b<sub>in</sub>)\n\nBy simply rewriting the mathematical expression one can save 50% of the multiplications required.\n\n===Algebraic properties===\nWhen many partially transparent layers need to be composited together, it is worthwhile to consider the algebraic properties of compositing operators used.  Specifically, the associativity and commutativity determine when repeated calculation can or cannot be avoided.\n\nConsider the case when we have four layers to blend to produce the final image: F=A*(B*(C*D)) where A, B, C, D are partially transparent image layers and \"*\" denotes a compositing operator (with the left layer on top of the right layer).  If only layer C changes, we should find a way to avoid re-blending all of the layers when computing F.  Without any special considerations, four full-image blends would need to occur.  For compositing operators that are [[commutative]], such as [[additive blending]], it is safe to re-order the blending operations.  In this case, we might compute T=A*(B*D) only once and simply blend T*C to produce F, a single operation.  Unfortunately, most operators are not commutative.  However, many are [[associative]], suggesting it is safe to re-group operations to F=(A*B)*(C*D), i.e. without changing their order.  In this case we may compute S:=A*B once and save this result.  To form F with an associative operator, we need only do two additional compositing operations to integrate the new layer S, by computing F:=S*(C*D).  Note that this expression indicates compositing C with all of the layers below it in one step and then blending all of the layers on top of it with the previous result to produce the final image in the second step.\n\nIf all layers of an image change regularly but a large number of layer still need to be composited (such as in distributed rendering), the commutativity of a compositing operator can still be exploited to speed up computation through [[parallelism (computing)|parallelism]] even when there is no gain from pre-computation.  Again, consider the image F=A*(B*(C*D)).  Each compositing operation in this expression depends on the next, leading to serial computation.  However, associativity can allow us to rewrite F=(A*B)*(C*D) where there are clearly two operations that do not depend on each other that may be executed in parallel.  In general, we can build a tree of pair-wise compositing operations with a height that is logarithmic in the number of layers.\n\n==Software ==\n\nThe most historically significant nonlinear compositing system was the [[Cineon]], which operated in a logarithmic color space, which more closely mimics the natural light response of film emulsions (the Cineon system, made by Kodak, is no longer in production). Due to the limitations of processing speed and memory, compositing artists did not usually have the luxury of having the system make intermediate conversions to linear space for the compositing steps.  Over time, the limitations have become much less significant, and now most compositing is done in a linear color space, even in cases where the source imagery is in a logarithmic color space.\n\nCompositing often also includes scaling, retouching and colour correction of images.\n\n===Node-based and layer-based compositing===\nThere are two radically different digital compositing workflows: node-based compositing and layer-based compositing.\n\nNode-based compositing represents an entire composite as a tree graph, linking media objects and effects in a procedural map, intuitively laying out the progression from source input to final output, and is in fact the way all compositing applications internally handle composites. This type of compositing interface allows great flexibility, including the ability to modify the parameters of an earlier image processing step \"in context\" (while viewing the final [[compositing|composite]]). Node-based compositing packages often handle keyframing and time effects poorly, as their workflow does not stem directly from a timeline, as do layer-based compositing packages. Software which incorporates a node based interface include [[Natron (software)|Natron]], [[Apple Shake]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Blackmagic Fusion]], and [[Nuke (software)|The Foundry's Nuke]].\n\nLayer-based compositing represents each media object in a composite as a separate layer within a timeline, each with its own time bounds, effects, and keyframes. All the layers are stacked, one above the next, in any desired order; and the bottom layer is usually [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] as a base in the resultant image, with each higher layer being progressively rendered on top of the previously composited of layers, moving upward until all layers have been rendered into the final composite. Layer-based compositing is very well suited for rapid [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] effects such as in motion graphics, but becomes awkward for more complex composites entailing a large number of layers. A partial solution to this is some programs' ability to view the composite-order of elements (such as images, effects, or other attributes) with a visual diagram called a [[Flowchart (Adobe)|flowchart]] to nest compositions, or \"comps,\" directly into other compositions, thereby adding complexity to the render-order by first compositing layers in the beginning composition, then combining that resultant image with the layered images from the proceeding composition, and so on. An example of this exists in the Adobe program [[After Effects]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Broadcast designer]]\n* [[Chroma key]]\n* [[Digital asset]]\n* [[Digital cinema]]\n* [[Digital on-screen graphic]] (BUG)\n* [[Gamma correction]]\n* [[Graphics coordinator]]\n* [[Motion graphic]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite conference\n|author1=Mansi Sharma |author2=Santanu Chaudhury |author3=Brejesh Lall |author4= | conference=Proceedings of the 2014 Indian Conference on Computer Vision Graphics and Image Processing, ACM New York, NY, USA \n| title=Content-aware seamless stereoscopic 3D compositing\n| date=2014\n| doi=10.1145/2683483.2683555\n| url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2683555\n}}\n* [[Tom Porter (computer scientist)|T.

''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: versions of Wilde during the last 100 years'' 2002</ref> A dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] lifestyle despite coming from a [[middle-class]] background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nPrevious manifestations of the ''petit-ma\u00eetre'' (French for \"small master\") and the [[Muscadin]] have been noted by John C. Prevost,<ref>''Le Dandysme en France (1817\u20131839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.</ref> but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.\n\n[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later \"metaphysical\" phase of dandyism,<ref>See Prevost 1957.</ref> as one who elevates [[\u00e6sthetics]] to a living religion,<ref>Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], \"The Painter of Modern Life\".</ref> that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: \"Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]\" and \"These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind.\"\n\nThe linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.<ref>Aileen Ribeiro, \"On Englishness in dress\" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.</ref> Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of \"the perfect gentleman\" or \"the autonomous aristocrat\". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the \"successfully marketed lives\" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].<ref>Schmid 2002.</ref>  [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;<ref>Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading \"Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation\".</ref> similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing (\"[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]\") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American-citizen colonists means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a \"dandy\" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee \"Yankee Doodle\"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].</ref> A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,<ref>{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a.

The original, full form of 'dandy' may have been ''jack-a-dandy''.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911</ref> It was a [[vogue word]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In that contemporary slang, a \"dandy\" was differentiated from a \"[[fop]]\" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning \"fine\" or \"great\"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.\n\n== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==\n[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]\nThe model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummell]] (1778\u20131840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was \"based on nothing at all,\" as [[Jules Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.<ref>Barbey d'Aurevilly, \"Du dandisme et de George Brummell,\" (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' 1925:87\u201392).</ref> Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,<ref>\"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century\" (Schmid 2002:83),</ref> he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]]. From the mid-1790s, Beau Brummell was the early incarnation of \"the celebrity\", a man chiefly famous for ''being'' famous.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nBy the time [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|taxed hair powder]] in 1795 to help pay for the war against France and to discourage the use of flour (which had recently increased in both rarity and price, owing to bad harvests) in such a frivolous product, Brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig, and had his hair cut in the Roman fashion, \"\u00e0 la Brutus\". Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark \"[[Trousers|pantaloons]],\" which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], just before age 62.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nMen of more notable accomplishments than Beau Brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose: [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]] occasionally dressed the part, helping reintroduce the frilled, lace-cuffed and lace-collared \"[[poet shirt]]\". In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n\nAnother prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.\n\nIn 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: <blockquote>A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...<ref>[[Thomas Carlyle]], \"The Dandiacal Body\", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements\u2014\"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on. It was an image of a well-dressed man who, while taking infinite pains about his appearance, affected indifference to it. This refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male Englishness.\"<ref>Ribeira 2002:21.</ref>\n\n== Dandyism in France ==\n[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joachim Murat]], the French [[King of Naples]], was dubbed the \"Dandy King\" because of his highly groomed appearance.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZbjtGC48-8C&pg=PA247&lpg=PA247 |title=10,000 Famous Freemasons from K to Z |publisher=Books.google.com |date=30 September 2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>]]\nThe beginnings of dandyism in France were bound to the politics of the [[French revolution]]; the initial stage of dandyism, the [[jeunesse dor\u00e9e|gilded youth]], was a political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style in order to distinguish its members from the [[sans-culottes]].\n\nDuring his heyday, [[Beau Brummell]]'s ''dictat'' on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme. His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n[[Baudelaire]] was deeply interested in dandyism, and memorably wrote that a dandy aspirant must have \"no profession other than elegance... no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons... The dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption; he must live and sleep before a mirror.\" Other French intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and [[boulevard]]s of Paris.

While in England and France individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners, the Spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes, called [[majos]]. They were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern Frenchified \"[[afrancesados]]\", as for their cheeky arrogant attitude.\nSome famous dandies in later times were amongst other the [[Duke of Osuna]], Mariano Tellez-Gir\u00f3n, artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and poet [[Luis Cernuda|Lu\u00eds Cernuda]].\n\n== Later thought ==\n[[Albert Camus]] said in ''[[The Rebel (book)|L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9]]'' (1951) that: <blockquote>The dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means. But it is an aesthetic of negation. \"To live and die before a mirror\": that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance. Up to now, man derived his coherence from the Creator. But from the moment that he consecrates his rupture from Him, he finds himself delivered over to the fleeting moment, to the passing days, and to wasted sensibility. Therefore he must take himself in hand. The dandy rallies his forces and creates a unity for himself by the very violence of his refusal. Profligate, like all people without a rule of life, he is only coherent as an actor. But an actor implies a public; the dandy can only play a part by setting himself up in opposition. He can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others' faces. Other people are his mirror. A mirror that quickly becomes clouded, it's true, since human capacity for attention is limited. It must be ceaselessly stimulated, spurred on by provocation. The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it.<ref>{{cite book|first=Albert|last=Camus|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt]]|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307827838|page=51|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_3yQrhdxwUC&pg=PA51|accessdate=11 October 2014|chapter=II Metaphysical Rebellion}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jean Baudrillard]] said that dandyism is \"an aesthetic form of nihilism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/ |title=Jean Baudrillard \u2013 Simulacra and Simulations \u2013 XVIII.

Actually, it is necessary to summon the void in itself, to conqueror the cool way that qualifies the dandy, which is \"thousand of kilometers farther from immediate sensations\". And for Eduardo Sanguinetti this means, in terms of the multiple strategics he will use in the passages from \"anti-fashion\" to \"look\" a radical self-emptying that emancipates from time, but that does not reject the effort that has to do to register the emerging novelty. Obtaining this space resembles a landscape, where, in accordance with Baudelaire \"carries Hercules upon his shoulders\".<ref>Espartaco Carlos 1989 \"Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits\" pag.98, 99 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n<!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->\n\n== Quaintrelle ==\n[[File:Dandizette.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1819 Dandizette]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}\nThe female counterpart is a quaintrelle, a woman who emphasizes a life of passion expressed through personal style, leisurely pastimes, charm, and cultivation of life's pleasures.\n\nIn the 12th century, ''cointerrels'' (male) and ''cointrelles'' (female) emerged, based upon ''coint'',<ref>Old English Dictionary</ref> a word applied to things skilfully made, later indicating a person of beautiful dress and refined speech.  By the 18th century, ''coint'' became ''quaint'',<ref>Dictionary of Early English</ref> indicating elegant speech and beauty.  Middle English dictionaries note ''quaintrelle'' as a beautifully dressed woman (or overly dressed), but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm.  The notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots.\n\nFemale dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early 19th century when ''dandy'' had a derisive definition of \"fop\" or \"over-the-top fellow\"; the female equivalents were ''dandyess'' or ''dandizette''.  Charles Dickens, in ''All the Year Around'' (1869) comments, \"The dandies and dandizettes of 1819\u20131820 must have been a strange race. ''Dandizette'' was a term applied to feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandy.\" In 1819, the novel ''Charms of Dandyism'' was published \"by Olivia Moreland, chief of the female dandies\"; although probably written by Thomas Ashe, \"Olivia Moreland\" may have existed, as Ashe did write several novels about living persons. Throughout the novel, dandyism is associated with \"living in style\".  Later, as the word ''dandy'' evolved to denote refinement, it became applied solely to men.  ''Popular Culture and Performance in the Victorian City'' (2003) notes this evolution in the latter 19th century: \"...or ''dandizette'', although the term was increasingly reserved for men.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Dandy (song)]] and [[Dedicated Follower of Fashion]],'' songs by [[The Kinks]] that parody modern (1960s) dandyism.\n* [[Adonis]]\n* [[Bishonen]]\n* [[Dude]]\n* [[Flamboyancy]]\n* [[Fl\u00e2neur]]\n* [[Fop]]\n* [[Gentleman]]\n* [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)]]\n* [[Incroyables]]\n* [[Macaroni (fashion)|Macaroni]]\n* [[Metrosexual]]\n* [[Narcissus (mythology)]]\n* [[Preppy]]\n* [[Swenkas]]\n* [[La Sape]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly, Jules]].

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment;\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context; \n:*improve [[diction]] or correct an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]; \n:*improve [[Timing (comedy)|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing; \n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization]]; \n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists;\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorized trademarked name);\n:*add or remove a product placement;\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of the movie.\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialized [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, a different actor than the original actor on set is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]] portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n\n===Rythmo band===\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]]. It provides a more precise guide for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronization with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organized in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n{{See also|Dub localization}}\n\nDubbing is often used to [[language localization|localize]] a foreign movie. The new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice artist]], or voice actor. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.\n\nEspecially in comedies and animated movies, famous local actors may be hired to perform the dubbing, as their names are intended to attract a local audience; the entire cast may be dubbed by a local cast of similar familiarity.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using exclusively a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films and TV programmes are dubbed in English. These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series. When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol|Paw Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.\n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad recepcion, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002-2017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome of the Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[Republic of Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]], where aired all over the country (today [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Republic of Macedonia=====\n[[Republic of Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there's no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching them with own dub. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they've dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{citar web|url=http://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|t\u00edtulo=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie \u2018Einstein\u2019 gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|acessodata=29 de mar\u00e7o de 2017|data=3 de fevereiro de 2017|obra=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognized (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the Netherlands, for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, the original audio is dubbed in their native language, while on-screen voices are usually subtitled.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\nIn movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original language with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or voiceover and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles. Animated films are commonly shown in both the original language and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many movies use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Albanian language can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

The original language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD,). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of even now the over-the -air television broadcaster, both versions are however offered to the customer simultaneously.\nBy default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles. \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales where for movies watched in the original language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of foreign languages movies was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the german newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the german dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognized for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements to the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nGerman dubbing voice artists of actors are enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

All television channels (both free and paid) broadcast foreign films and series dubbed - with only very rare exceptions. In some foreign channels (in the past, for example, Hallmark Channel) broadcast in the Czech Republic, was broadcast sometimes Slovak dubbed versions (for example [[Living with the Dead (film)|Living with the Dead]]). According to the language laws for television broadcasting, there is no use of Slovak dubbing prohibited, because it is equivalent to the official language of that country. In Czech TV, for example, until 2002, the series of [[Dempsey and Makepeace]] was broadcast only in Slovak dubbing. Films in cinemas are usually provided only with subtitles, but some films like family films, films aimed at a young audience, and major film series (especially those in 3D) are also dubbed, and a subtitled version is available only in a few cinemas. It is also common for well-known foreign actors to be dubbed by one individual Czech voice actor; for instance [[Clint Eastwood]] has been dubbed by Ladislav \u017dupani\u010d in 39 of 42 films distributed in the Czech Republic.\n\n=====Slovakia=====\nIn [[Slovakia]], home media market, Czech dubbed versions are widely used, with only children's films and some few exceptions (for example [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]) that have been dubbed for cinema being released with Slovak dubbing. Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localization (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one lector, preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronization. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of those time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948-1998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', October 12, 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (for instance ''The Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, ''Skylanders'' series, ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, ''Halo'' or ''Harry Potter'' series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since 1980's. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson\u2019s ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version<ref>http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/</ref><ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay</ref>.  Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'', ''[[Godzilla 2000]]'', ''[[Anatomy (film)|Anatomy]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[High Tension]]'' flopped at United States box office.<ref>https://archive.is/iFLyE</ref><ref>http://www.boxofficeguru.com/082100.htm</ref><ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-horn7</ref><ref>http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/</ref>  When [[Miramax]] planned to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.<ref>http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Gary G.|title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|year=2007|page=44|isbn=0742554503}}</ref>\nStill, English-dubbed movies have much better commercial potential in [[ancillary market]]; therefore, more distributors would release live-action foreign films in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles), then release both original versions and English-dubbed versions in [[ancillary market]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ault, Susanne. \"Magnolia speaks English, more\", ''[[Video Business]]'', 28 May 2007</ref>  \n\nOn the other hand, [[anime]] is almost always released in English-dubbed format, regardless of its content or target age group. The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. It must be noted, however, that in a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticized for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] on Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] on DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. All movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. Peru doesn't produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country. However, there is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on broadcast TV, with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognized for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here.

Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticized by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France. In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated movie to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s. In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.<ref name=humes20131122/><ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], Xinhua News Agency, 24 February 2013.</ref>\nMotion pictures are dubbed for China's [[Mongols in China|Mongol-]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur-speaking]] markets as well.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Paul |last=Clark|publisher=CUP Archive |year=1987|isbn=0521326389\n|title=Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949|series=Cambridge studies in film\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jzQ9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localization, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[TBS (TV Channel)|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-Ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-Ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.

Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well, because there aren't many Indonesian voices, mostly in dubbed movies, three character can have exactly the same voice.\n\nReality shows never dubbed in Indonesian, because it was not a planned-interaction such as in movies, so if they appear in TV, it will be appear with subtitles on it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. English-language programmes used to usually air in their original language in free-to-air television. However, since the late 1990s/early 2000s, more English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. TV5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Tagalog. Even Studio 23 (now ABS-CBN Sports and Action) which used to show all of its foreign programmes in English, had adopted dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Tagalog or another Philippine regional language. Also [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Tagalog, except for the singing parts, which retains its original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''). Dubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] and the original language version is aired. Also popular in the Philippines are Chinese, Korean, and Mexican dramas, which are called ''Chinovelas'', ''Koreanovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively. All of these dramas have always been dubbed in Tagalog or another Philippine regional language, with its unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\nAs of late 2018 only two [[Nickelodeon]] shows are aired in Filipino Dub on [[ABS-CBN]] after the Nick block was dissolved while [[GMA Network]] have lots of them. As for Kids on 5 block on [[The 5 Network]], most Disney shows will come to an end in late 2018 and the local version of DisneyLife will add to its own language (Filipino) due to Disney-Fox merger but DreamWorks shows will continue unchanged.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some channels where foreign films or TV series are dubbed into Tagalog have proliferated. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films from abroad dubbed into Tagalog. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Tagalog for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Tagalog. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Tagalog such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]]. [[GMA News TV]] airs some English-language documentaries, movies, and reality series dubbed in Tagalog. The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Tagalog. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films especially English films shown in cinemas are almost always shown in their original language. Non-English films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Tagalog are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing of foreign languages is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to the high literacy rate among the population who speak the languages. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]]'s channel. The finished works are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well.\n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the knowledge of the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Various big popular dubbing studios in India are featured such as [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]], [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]] and more.\n\nFor a list of Indian voice-dubbing artists, click [[List of Indian dubbing artists|here]].

Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in Early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), are usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours . [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-overs]] or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n===Africa===\n====The Maghreb====\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the history of colonization of these countries by France and the widespread use of the French language (among the intellectual elite), in addition to the marginalization the two spoken languages, Berber and Darija. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in Arab countries with a strong tradition of dubbing and subtitling (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]). The evolution of movies targeting the adult audience was different. After the satellite boom in the [[Arab world]] and the emergence of Pan-Arab channels, the use of subtitles, which was already popular in the [[Middle East]], was highly popular among local viewers in Algeria and Morocco.\n\nIn the Arab world (member states in [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and others), only children's films and TV series were dubbed in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Many different anime titles are dubbed in the Arabic language, as well. Everything else is usually shown in its original language with Arabic subtitles. Recently, The Arabic dubbing industry has boomed, and channels such as [[MBC Max]], are now offering famous older action films aimed at an older audience dubbed in Arabic to be broadcast on television. Action movies such as ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' have become some of the first foreign action titles to be dubbed in Arabic, rather than using subtitles, on the [[MBC Max]] channel. However, they can still be watched in their original language with subtitles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waleg.com/archives/017759.html |title=Blockbuster Movies in Arabic on MBC |publisher=Waleg.com |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere's even a list that showcases Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers that associate with them.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Arabic dubbing artists !! Actor(s)/Actress(es) !! Notes\n|-\n| [[Safi Mohammed]] || [[Elijah Wood]] || \n|}\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], theaters usually show French-dubbed movies, but cinema attendance in the country for such movies is in continuous decline compared to Tunisian and Arab movies. This decline can be traced to the huge popularity of free-to-air [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arab]] movie channels offering primarily subtitled content, and the government's reduced efforts to limit piracy. Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. This move was highly successful locally, but was not able to compete with mainstream dubbing companies (especially in the Middle East). In the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule and sometimes broadcast foreign content dubbed into French (excluding children content), although some of them, such as [[Hannibal TV]], started adopting subtitling in Arabic instead, which proved to be more popular than simply importing French-dubbed content.{{dubious|date=October 2017}}\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=BfdyVOHALcLbO4nNgMgD&id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]].

The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign-language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[Maori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[Maori language|Maori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle (captioning)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purist]]s often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |first= |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version, and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasizes dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronized voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronized Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronized voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronized voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronized form.\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localized.\n\nTo achieve synchronization when animations are intended only for the source language, localized content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localized dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localized audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into dialects==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a dialect of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which used the Mexican voice cast), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation). In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into Spanish (Spain) and Neutral Spanish (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms).\n\nAnother example is the French dialect dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which is entirely different in [[Quebec]] and [[France]], the humor being very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing. The French-language [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon (Canada)|T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]] network once aired the Quebec dub for ''The Simpsons'', as well as Parisian French dubs of ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', which were both similar to the Parisian dub for ''The Simpsons''. The two latter shows have since been taken off the network, while ''The Simpsons'' continues its run on T\u00e9l\u00e9toon.\n\n[[Quebec French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]] but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, cost causes American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain importance in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]] and, subsequently, all major animation films gained European Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-dubbed classics were released with new Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], in [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]] share a common German-dubbed version. Although there are some differences in German dialects, all films, shows and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily [[Germans]] and [[Austrians]] since there has been a long tradition of dubbing films. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), which especially concerns animated films and Disney films. They are made for amusement and as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German dialects include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular dialect version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German dialect dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanDialects|title=German Dialects / Useful Notes - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2017}} and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe many [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally hilarious, this has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to part of the 1980s culture.\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech. Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea regarding how to perform the role. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid [[sliver triangle]]s.

For four or more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible triangulations that split the [[Quadrilateral|quadrangle]] into two triangles satisfies the \"Delaunay condition\", i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles of all triangles have empty interiors.\n\nBy considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions.  Generalizations are possible to [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] other than [[Euclidean distance]]. However, in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.\n\n==Relationship with the Voronoi diagram==\n\nThe Delaunay [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of a [[discrete space|discrete]] point set '''P''' in [[general position]] corresponds to the [[dual graph]] of the [[Voronoi diagram]] for '''P'''.

It is known<ref name=\"Delaunay1934\"/> that there exists a unique Delaunay triangulation for '''P''' if '''P''' is a set of points in ''[[general position]]''; that is, the affine hull of '''P''' is ''d''-dimensional and no set of ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points in '''P''' lie on the boundary of a ball whose interior does not intersect '''P'''.\n\nThe problem of finding the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] can be converted to the problem of finding the [[convex hull]] of a set of points in (''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional space, by giving each point ''p'' an extra coordinate equal to |''p''|<sup>2</sup>, taking the bottom side of the convex hull, and mapping back to ''d''-dimensional space by deleting the last coordinate. As the convex hull is unique, so is the triangulation, assuming all facets of the convex hull are [[simplex|simplices]]. Nonsimplicial facets only occur when ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 of the original points lie on the same ''d''-[[hypersphere]], i.e., the points are not in general position. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Fukuda |first1=Komei |title=Frequently Asked Questions in Polyhedral Computation |url=https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/polyfaq/node30.html#voro:dela_def |website=www.cs.mcgill.ca |accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[File: Example steps in Delauney triangularization.png|thumb|Example steps]]\n[[File:Delaunay triangulation does not minimize edge length.gif|thumb|Each frame of the animation shows a Delaunay triangulation of the four points.

When a vertex ''v'' is added, we split in three the triangle that contains ''v'', then we apply the flip algorithm.  Done na\u00efvely, this will take O(''n'') time: we search through all the triangles to find the one that contains ''v'', then we potentially flip away every triangle.  Then the overall runtime is O(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIf we insert vertices in random order, it turns out (by a somewhat intricate proof) that each insertion will flip, on average, only O(1) triangles \u2013 although sometimes it will flip many more.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last1 = Guibas\n  | first1 = Leonidas J.\n  | authorlink1 = Leonidas J.

We can store the history of the splits and flips performed: each triangle stores a pointer to the two or three triangles that replaced it.  To find the triangle that contains ''v'', we start at a root triangle, and follow the pointer that points to a triangle that contains ''v'', until we find a triangle that has not yet been replaced.  On average, this will also take O(log ''n'') time.

The sweep-hull is created sequentially by iterating a radially-sorted set of 2D points, and connecting triangles to the visible part of the convex hull, which gives a non-overlapping triangulation. One can build a convex hull in this manner so long as the order of points guarantees no point would fall within the triangle. But, radially sorting should minimize flipping by being highly Delaunay to start. This is then paired with a final iterative triangle flipping step.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]] of a set of points is a subset of the Delaunay triangulation of the same points, and this can be exploited to compute it efficiently.\n\nFor modelling terrain or other objects given a set of sample points, the Delaunay triangulation gives a nice set of triangles to use as polygons in the model.  In particular, the Delaunay triangulation avoids narrow triangles (as they have large circumcircles compared to their area). See [[triangulated irregular network]].\n\nDelaunay triangulations can be used to determine the density or intensity of points samplings by means of the [[Delaunay tessellation field estimator|Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE)]].\n\n[[File:Delaunay Triangulation (100 Points).svg|right|thumb|250px|The Delaunay triangulation of a random set of 100 points in a plane.]]\nDelaunay triangulations are often used to build meshes for space-discretised solvers such as the [[finite element method]] and the [[finite volume method]] of physics simulation, because of the angle guarantee and because fast triangulation algorithms have been developed.  Typically, the domain to be meshed is specified as a coarse [[simplicial complex]]; for the mesh to be numerically stable, it must be refined, for instance by using [[Ruppert's algorithm]].\n\nThe increasing popularity of [[finite element method]] and [[boundary element method]] techniques increases the incentive to improve automatic meshing algorithms. However, all of these algorithms can create distorted and even unusable grid elements. Fortunately, several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality. For example, smoothing (also referred to as mesh refinement) is one such method, which repositions nodal locations so as to minimize element distortion. The [[stretched grid method]] allows the generation of pseudo-regular meshes that meet the Delaunay criteria easily and quickly in a one-step solution.\n\n[[Constrained Delaunay triangulation]] has found applications in path planning in automated driving <ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mobility/publications/IV2012_Anderson_Karumanchi_Iagnemma.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721154515/http://web.mit.edu/mobility/publications/IV2012_Anderson_Karumanchi_Iagnemma.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Beta skeleton]]\n* [[Centroidal Voronoi tessellation]]\n* [[Ruppert's algorithm]] - Delaunay refinement\n* [[Delone set]] - also known as a Delaunay set\n* [[Disordered hyperuniformity]]\n* [[Fairy circle (arid grass formation)]]\n* [[Gabriel graph]]\n* [[Giant's Causeway]]\n* [[Gradient pattern analysis]]\n* [[Farthest-first traversal]] - Incremental Voronoi insertion\n* [[Linde\u2013Buzo\u2013Gray algorithm]]\n* [[Lloyd's algorithm]] - Voronoi iteration \n* [[Meyer set]]\n* [[Pisot\u2013Vijayaraghavan number]]\n* [[Pitteway triangulation]]\n* [[Plesiohedron]]\n* [[Hamming bound]] - Sphere-packing bound\n* [[Salem number]]\n* [[Steiner point (triangle)]]\n* [[Urquhart graph]]\n* [[Convex hull algorithms]]\n* [[Quasicrystal]]\n* [[Quasitriangulation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Delaunay triangulation in [[CGAL]], the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library:\n** [[Mariette Yvinec]].

For example, [[Scots law]] does not use the term \"defendant\"; the terms \"accused\" or \"panel\" are used instead in criminal proceedings, and \"defender\" in civil proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/29/0/Glossary/a#P |title=Glossary - Help - Judiciary of Scotland |publisher=Scotland-judiciary.org.uk |date=1976-05-03 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==Criminal defendants==\n\nIn a criminal trial, a defendant is a person accused ([[Criminal charge|charged]]) of committing an offense (a crime; an act defined as punishable under [[criminal law]]). The other party to a criminal trial is usually a public [[prosecutor]], but in some jurisdictions, private prosecutions are allowed.\n\nCriminal defendants are often taken into custody by [[police]] and brought before a court under an [[arrest warrant]]. Criminal defendants are usually obliged to post [[bail]] before being released from custody. For serious cases, such as murder, bail is often refused. Defendants must be present at every stage of the proceedings against them. (There is an exception for very minor cases such as traffic offenses in jurisdictions which treat them as crimes.)\n\nIf more than one person is accused, the people may be referred as \"co-defendant\" or \"co-conspiritor\" in British and Common-Law courts.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, vulnerable defendants may be able to get access of services of a [[Non-Registered Intermediary]] to assist with communication at court.<ref>O'Mahony, B.M., Smith, K., & Milne, R. (2011). \"The early identification of vulnerable witnesses prior to an investigative interview\". ''British Journal of Forensic Practice'', 13 (2), 114-123</ref>\n\n==Civil defendants==\n\nIn a civil [[lawsuit]], a defendant (or a '''respondent''') is also the accused [[Party (law)|party]], although not of an offense, but of a [[civil wrong]] (a [[tort]] or a [[breach of contract]], for instance). The person who starts the [[Civil law (area)|civil]] action through filing a [[complaint]] is referred to as the [[plaintiff]]. \n\nDefendants in civil actions usually make their first court appearance voluntarily in response to a summons. Historically, civil defendants could be taken into custody under a writ of ''[[Caspian ad respondent]]''. Modern-day civil defendants are usually able to avoid most (if not all) court appearances if represented by a [[lawyer]]. \n\nMost often and familiarly, defendants are persons: either [[natural person]]s (actual human beings) or [[Legal_personality#Juridical_persons|juridical person]]s (''persona fiction'') under the [[legal fiction]] of treating organizations as persons. But a defendant may be an object, in which case the object itself is the direct subject of the action. When a court has jurisdiction over an object, it is said to have [[jurisdiction in rem|jurisdiction ''in rem'']]. An example of an ''in rem'' case is ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'' (1916), where the defendant was not [[The Coca-Cola Company]] itself, but rather \"Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola\". In current US legal practice, ''in rem'' suits are primarily [[asset forfeiture]] cases, based on drug laws, as in ''[[USA v. $124,700]]'' (2006).\n\nDefendants can set up an account to pay for litigation costs and [[legal expense]]s. These [[legal defense fund]]s can have large membership counts where members contribute to the fund. The fund can be public or private and is set up for individuals, organizations, or a particular purpose. These funds are often used by public officials, civil-rights organizations, and public-interest organizations.\n\n==England and Wales==\n\nHistorically, \"defendant\" was a legal term for a person prosecuted for [[misdemeanour]]. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for [[felony]].<ref>[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. [[Sweet and Maxwell]]. Fourth Edition. 1960.

He is the author of the  [[Hyperion Cantos]] and the  [[Ilium/Olympos]] cycles, among other works which span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy [[genres]], sometimes within a single novel. A typical example of Simmons' intermingling of genres is ''[[Song of Kali]]'' (1985), winner of the [[World Fantasy Award]].<ref name=\"WWE-1986\"/> He also writes mysteries and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Peoria, Illinois]], Simmons received a [[B.A.]] in English from [[Wabash College]] in 1970 and, in 1971, a [[Masters in Education]] from [[Washington University in St. Louis]].<ref name=biog>{{cite web| url=http://dansimmons.com/about/bio.htm | title= About Dan: Biographic Sketch | website=dansimmons.com | accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through [[Harlan Ellison]]'s help, his short story \"[[Prayers to Broken Stones#\"The River Styx Runs Upstream\"|The River Styx Runs Upstream]]\" was published and awarded first prize in a ''[[Twilight Zone Magazine]]'' story competition. Simmons' first novel, ''Song of Kali'', was released in 1985.<ref name=biog/>\n\nHe worked in elementary education until 1989.<ref name=biog/>\n\n==Horror fiction==\n''[[Summer of Night]]'' (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, [[Illinois]]. The novel, which was praised by [[Stephen King]] in a cover blurb, is similar to King's ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986) in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.\n\nIn the sequel to ''Summer of Night'', ''[[A Winter Haunting]]'' (2002), Dale Stewart (one of the first book's protagonists and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life. \n\nBetween the publication of ''Summer of Night'' (1991) and ''A Winter Haunting'' (2002), several additional characters from ''Summer of Night'' appeared in: ''[[Children of the Night (Simmons novel)|Children of the Night]]'' (1992), a loose sequel to ''Summer of Night'', which features Mike O'Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city; ''[[Fires of Eden]]'' (1994), in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and ''Darwin's Blade'' (2000), a thriller in which Dale's younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.<ref>{{cite news|work=Publisher's Weekly|title=Review: ''Darwin's Blade''|date=October 30, 2000 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-380-97369-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Simmons, Dan|title=Darwin's Blade|publisher=William Morrow|date=2000|isbn=978-0-380-97369-9}}</ref> \n\nSoon after ''[[Summer of Night]]'' (1991), Simmons, who had written mostly horror fiction, began to focus on writing science fiction, although in 2007 he returned with a work of [[historical fiction]] and horror, ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]''. In 2009, he published another book, ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]]'', based on the last years of [[Charles Dickens]]' life leading up to the writing of ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.<ref name=\"st090215\"/>\n\n==Historical fiction==\n\n''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Captain [[John Franklin]]'s expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. The two ships, HMS ''Erebus'' and HMS ''Terror'', become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.\n\n''The Abominable'' (2013) recounts a mid-1920s attempt on [[Mount Everest]] by five climbers\u2014two English, one French, one Sherpa, and one American (the narrator)\u2014to recover the body of one of the English character's cousin.<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: 'The Abominable' by Dan Simmons|date=October 20, 2013|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-1020-abominable-dan-simmons-20131020-story.html|author=Robbins, Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Literary references==\nMany of Simmons' works have strong ties with classic literature.

September 1793{{snd}}27 June 1848) was [[Archbishop of Paris]]  from 1840 to 1848. He was killed while trying to negotiate peace during the [[June Days uprising]] of 1848.\n\nHis cause of canonization has commenced and he is titled as a [[Servant of God]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1848.htm|title=1848|publisher=Hagiography Circle|date=|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and career===\nAffre was born at [[Saint-Rome-de-Tarn]], in the department of [[Aveyron]]. At the age of 14, he began to study for the priesthood at the Seminary of [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]], which was under the direction of his uncle, the [[Abb\u00e9]] Denis Boyer, [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|S.S.]] He was an excellent student, and, while still a seminarian, soon became an instructor of [[dogmatic theology]] at the seminary in [[Nantes]]. \n\nIn 1818, he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as a [[Catholic priest]]. From 1823 to 1833 he served as the [[Vicar General]], first of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lu\u00e7on|Diocese of Lu\u00e7on]] and then of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Amiens|Amiens]]. In 1839, he was appointed as [[coadjutor bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Strasbourg]].{{sfn|Grey|1913}}\n\nAffre was elevated to the post of [[Archbishop of Paris]] in 1840. Though opposed to the government of King [[Louis-Philippe I]], he fully accepted the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]] in 1848;<ref name=DP>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/645-Denis-Auguste-Affre-1840-1848.html|work=Dioc\u00e8se de Paris|title=Denis-Auguste Affre (1840-1848)|language=fr}}</ref> nevertheless he took no part in politics, but devoted himself to [[pastoral care]]. He opened new [[parish]]es in the working-class neighborhoods of the city. Among them were M\u00e9nilmontant, Plaisance, Petit-Montrouge, Maison-Blanche, Petit-Gentilly, Notre-Dame de la Gare, Billancourt, Gros-Caillou.<ref name=DP/>\n\nAffre was passionate in his determination to improve the study of theology in order to form clergy needed in the challenges which the Catholic Church faced at the time. He also was insistent on education as a human right. He opened a new seminary in Paris, called the [[:fr:S\u00e9minaire des Carmes|St. Joseph of the Carmelites Seminary]], on the site of a former Carmelite [[priory]], and a [[school of theology]] at the [[Sorbonne]].\n\n===Death===\nAffre's episcopate, however, is chiefly remembered owing to its tragic close during the [[insurrection of June 1848]].\n\nOn 23 June 1848, faced with starvation due to plans by the French government to close the [[National Workshops]] it had recently created in order to provide work to the poor, a large segment of the citizenry began rioting, setting up barricades in the streets of Paris. The crisis led to the government's handing dictatorial powers over the nation to General [[Louis Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac]], who was determined to use all force necessary to crush the rebellion and ordered the [[National Guard (France)|French National Guard]] into Paris. Seeing the carnage caused among the civilian population by this campaign, [[Frederic Ozanam]], the founder of the [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], begged Affre to intervene to stop the bloodshed. The archbishop was led to believe that by his personal involvement peace might be restored between the military and the [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAccordingly, on 25 June, in spite of the warning of Cavaignac, Affre mounted the barricade at the entrance to the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], bearing a green branch as sign of peace to address both sides. He had spoken only a few words, however, when the insurgents, hearing some shots and feeling that they had been betrayed, opened fire upon the National Guard. Affre fell, struck by a stray bullet. He was taken to his palace, where he died on 27 June.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn the next day, the [[National Assembly of France]] issued a decree expressing its great sorrow over Affre's death, and the public funeral held on 7 July was one of the most striking public spectacles of the period. The crowd following his [[cortege]] was estimated to have numbered about 200,000 people.\n\nAffre was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Denis in the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. His heart was removed and preserved in the chapel of the Carmelite Seminary, which he had founded. The [[pectoral cross]] which he was wearing when he was shot\u2014seen in his portrait\u2014is preserved by the Archdiocese of Paris as a [[relic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/651-Croix-pectorale.html|work=Dioc\u00e8se de Paris|title=Croix pectorale|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nA street in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.catholique.fr/-Saint-Bernard-de-la-Chapelle-.html|work=Dioc\u00e8se de Paris|title=Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nAffre wrote several articles for a newspaper called ''La France chr\u00e9tienne''. Additionally he published two books to guide in the practical matters of handling Church property: '' Un Trait\u00e9 de l'administration temporelle des paroisses'' (Paris, 1827) and ''Un Trait\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens eccl\u00e9siastiques'' (Paris, 1837).

Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)#Special editions|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. Leary has close ties with 107.3/[[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]], which in 2000 released the station album ''Survive This!'' Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2&nbsp;million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the [[New Orleans Fire Department]] to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Controversies==\n===Plagiarism===\nFor many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]].

Due to dextromethorphan's SSRI (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor)-like action, the sudden cessation of recreational dosing in tolerant individuals can result in mental and physical withdrawal symptoms similar to the withdrawal from SSRIs. These withdrawal effects can manifest as psychological effects, including depression, irritability, cravings, and as physical effects, including lethargy, body aches, and a sensation of unpleasant tingling, not unlike a mild \"electric shock.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugabusehelp.com/drugs/dxm/ |title=Drug Abuse Help: DXM Information |website=Drugabusehelp.com |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info-drug-rehab.com/dxm.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011848/http://info-drug-rehab.com/dxm.html |archivedate=17 September 2013 |title=:: Cough Syrup and Dextromethorphan (DXM) Addiction and Abuse \u2013 Drug Rehab Information :: |website=Info-drug-rehab.com}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nDextromethorphan's effects have been divided into four plateaus. The first plateau (1.5 to 2.5&nbsp;mg per kg body weight) is described as having euphoria, auditory changes, and change in perception of gravity. The second plateau (2.5 to 7.5&nbsp;mg/kg) causes intense [[euphoria]], vivid imagination, and [[closed-eye hallucination]]s may occur.

Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an [[ion exchange]] reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.\n\nIn 1981, a paper by Gosselin estimated that the lethal dose is between 50 and 500&nbsp;mg/kg.

It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first Doctorates were awarded at the [[University of Bologna]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Having become established in European [[universities]], this usage spread around the world. Contracted \"Dr\" or \"Dr.\", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a [[Doctorate]] (e.g. [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether they hold a doctoral-level degree.\n\n==Origins==\nThe doctorate ({{lang-la|doce\u014d|lit=I teach}}) appeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] as a license to teach ({{lang-la|licentia docendi|links=no}}) at a [[medieval university]].<ref name=\"Lexikon des Mittelalters: Doctor, doctoratus\">{{cite journal | last=Verger | first=J. | title=Doctor, doctoratus | journal=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume=3 | pages=1155\u20131156 | publisher=J.B.

Over time the D.D. has gradually become less common and studies outside theology, law, and medicine have become more common (such studies were then called \"philosophy\", but are now classified as sciences and humanities \u2013 however this usage survives in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy).\n\nThe Ph.D. was originally a [[academic degree|degree]] granted by a [[university]] to learned individuals who had achieved the approval of their peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career in the field of philosophy (in the broad sense of the term, meaning the pursuit of knowledge). The appellation of \"Doctor\" (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, knowledge, and the spread of knowledge. The Ph.D. entered widespread use in the 19th century at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. Prior to the formal degree, the contemporary doctorate (PhD), arguably, arose in Leipzig as a successor to the Master's (MA) degree in 1652 (Dr. habil).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124147/http://erhard-weigel-gesellschaft.de.dedi2970.your-server.de/biographie-weigels/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn some European countries, such as Italy and Portugal, Doctor became a title given to all or most degree holders, not just those with doctorates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Using Portuguese: A Guide to Contemporary Usage|author1=\n Ana Sofia Ganho|author2=Timothy McGovern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGCq9t6DQf8C&pg=PA24|page=24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=18 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quadrodeititoli.it/Index.aspx?IDL=2|title=Italian Qualification Framework for the Higher Education|accessdate=14 December 2016|publisher=Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca}}</ref> \nAs a result, the title is used by many professionals in these countries, including those such as lawyers who are not normally granted the title elsewhere.<ref>Portugal: [http://www.martindale.com/Alves-Pereira-Teixeira-de-Sousa/1996365-law-firm-2982267-people.htm Alves Periera Teixeira de Sousa].

As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.). Similarly in the US, even though degrees became standard for lawyers much earlier, the degree was again the LL.B., only becoming the [[Juris Doctor]] generally in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nIn many English-speaking countries, it is common to refer to physicians by the title of doctor, even when they do not hold a doctoral level qualification. The word ''Doctor'' has long had a secondary meaning in English of [[physician]], e.g. in [[Johnson's Dictionary]], which quotes its use with this meaning by [[Shakespeare]].<ref name=Johnson1/> In the US, the medical societies established the proprietary medical colleges in the 19th century to award their own MDs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001936.htm|title=Doctor of medicine profession|work=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref> but in the UK and the British Empire, where degree granting was strictly controlled, this was not an option.

The council of the surgeons' College felt it to be impractical to secure the legal right to the title as this would mean gaining the right to award M.D.s, but noted that the title had been used by the public to refer to medics for generations and was used without any legal right by Bachelors of Medicine \u2013 the only obstacle to licentiates of both colleges doing the same was the prohibition in the physicians' bylaws.

In recent times, other surgically orientated specialists, such as [[gynaecologist]]s, have also adopted these prefixes. A surgeon who is also a professor is usually known as \"Professor\" and, similarly, a surgeon who has been ennobled, knighted, created a baronet or appointed a dame uses the corresponding title (Lord, Sir, Dame). [[Physician]]s, on the other hand, when they pass their \"[[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP(UK)]]\" examinations, or equivalent, do not drop ''Dr'' but retain it, even as consultants.

An attempt by their professional body to prevent [[chiropractors]] from calling themselves \"Doctor\" failed in the courts, in part because it was pointed out that practicing chiropractors may hold an academic doctorate in their discipline, and it would be anomalous to prevent them using the title when holders of doctorates in non-medical disciplines faced no such restriction.\n\n====India====\nIn [[India]], general practitioners in the field of [[medicine]], [[dentistry]] are usually addressed as doctor even though they hold bachelor's level degrees such as practitioners after a rigorous 4\u20136 years of clinical and academic training, once recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]], can legally write the eponym 'Dr' in front of their names.

Academic doctors do not have the right to practice medicine.\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe Indonesian titles \"dr.\" is used in front of the name of medical doctor who holds a specification as general practitioner, also when the doctor already holds his specialization to ___, such as \"Sp.THT\" or \"Spesialis Telinga, Hidung, Tenggorokan\" (ENT or Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist).\n\nDr. is used in front of the name as the title \"Doktor\" for doctorate title, the same level as Ph.D. title.\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]], the title of Doctor (Dr.) can be used by [[Ph.D.]] degree holders as well as medical, dental and veterinary doctors with [[MBBS]], [[dental degree|BDS]] and [[veterinary education|DVM]] degrees respectively. Usage by [[Pharmacists]] and [[physiotherapists]] with [[PharmD]] and [[doctor of physical therapy|DPT]] degrees respectively is disputed, with the [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] saying they should not use the title, but the [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body for pharmacists) and the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] permitting and encouraging its use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1198927|title=PMDC divests pharmacists, physios of doctor title|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|author=Asif Chaudhry|date=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n====The Philippines====\nIn the [[Philippines]], titles and names of occupations usually follow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] naming conventions which utilize gender-specific terms. \"''Dokt\u00f3r''\" is the masculine form, which retains the abbreviation ''Dr.''; the feminine form is \"''Dokt\u00f3ra''\", and is abbreviated usually as \"''Dra.''\"; others, however, some being [[English language|Anglophones]] who wish to sound modern and Westernised (or were raised in an almost exclusively English-speaking family environment), or some who advocate gender equality, would dispense with the distinction altogether. There does exist in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] an equivalent, gender-neutral term for the professional that carries the more general notion of \"healer\", traditional (for example, an ''[[albularyo|albul\u00e1ryo]]'') or otherwise: ''manggag\u00e1mot''.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] the title doctor \"Dr.\" is used for both physicians (including dentists and veterinarians) and Ph.D. holders. However, when addressing in native [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] a physician is addressed as \"Vaidya\" (\u0dc0\u0ddb\u0daf\u0dca\u0dba) or \"Dosthara\" (\u0daf\u0ddc\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dad\u0dbb) while a Ph.D. holder is addressed as \"Aacharya\" (\u0d86\u0da0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba).\n\n====Thailand====\nThe usage of Doctor (\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c) or Dr (\u0e14\u0e23.) has been borrowed from English. It can be seen as a title in academic circles and in the mass media. In contrast to other academic titles (Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor), the use of Doctor as a title has not been recognized by the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]]. Therefore, this title, in theory, cannot be used officially. For example, in court of justice where strictly formal Thai language is used, Dr cannot be mentioned as a person's title.\n\n===The Americas===\n\n====Canada====\nCanada lies somewhere between British and American usage of the degree and terminology of \"doctor\". Research doctorates \u2013 PhDs and ScDs \u2013 are entitled to use the title \"doctor\".

In some provinces it is also possible to earn the [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]] (D.P.M) or [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm.D.). In some provinces, such as Ontario, psychologists take a PhD in Psychology rather than the PsyD degree. In Ontario, only chiropractors, dentists, medical doctors, optometrists and psychologists can use the title \"doctor\", when offering or purporting to offer health related services, while registered naturopathic doctors (N.D.) may only use the title \"doctor\" in written format if they also use the phrase, \"naturopathic doctor\" immediately following their name.

(\"Juridicae Doctor\" or \"Juris Doctor\") degree (considered, like the medical professional degrees, to be at bachelor's level<ref name=cdqf/>) to their existing students and to their alumni - as a replacement for the degree they traditionally awarded: the [[Bachelor of Laws#Canada|LL.B.]] (\"Legum Baccalaureus\" or \"Bachelor of Laws\"). The course requirements did not change, only the name. Canadian law schools started offering this option to  their graduates to make it easier to practise in the United States (where law schools have traditionally granted a J.D. rather than an LL.B.). The convention governing use of the title \"Dr\" by lawyers has not changed in Canada. The only lawyers who typically use \"Dr\" are those who have continued with their studies, in order to obtain both an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] (\"Legum Magister\" or \"Master of Laws\") and an [[Doctor of Juridical Science|S.J.D.]] (\"Scientiae Juridicae Doctor\" or \"Doctor of the Science of the Law\").

It can also be used prenominally, when accompanied by the name of the profession immediately after the name, by professionals who require a doctorate for their professional licence, such as psychology or chiropractic, e.g. ''Dr X, psychologue'' or ''Dr Y, chiropraticien''.

In many European languages the term ''doctor'' is distinct from a medical practitioner, which can be referred to as e.g. ''l\u00e4kare'' in Swedish, ''Arzt'' in German, ''dokter'' or ''arts'' in Dutch, or ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' in Finnish.\n\nStandardisation of degrees into the three cycles of bachelor's\u2013master's\u2013doctorate across the [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA) is being carried out through the [[Bologna process]], although not all EHEA member states have fully conformed to the 1999 [[Bologna declaration]] in favour of their own historic customs. With respect to the title \"doctor\", it should be noted that the Bologna process makes no prescriptions regarding the names of degrees nor the titles they may confer. However, under the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]], recognition of a foreign degree allows \"the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which recognition is sought\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enic-naric.net/the-lisbon-recognition-convention.aspx|title=The Lisbon Recognition Convention|website=Enic-Naric|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> According to the ''Explanatory report'', this means that: \"The competent authorities of the Parties may grant the right to use the title in the exact form in which it was awarded in the Party concerned or in any other form.

Contrary to popular belief, \"Dr.\" is not part of the name but a degree like \"Mag.\" or \"Dipl.-Ing.\". It is not mandatory to use the title, although it can be added to official documents (driver's licence, passport, etc.), if desired.\n\n====Finland====\nIn Finland, the title of ''tohtori'' or ''doktor'' denotes holder of a research doctorate comparable to a PhD. Getting the doctorate requires advanced studies after the master's degree, writing a [[thesis]], nowadays often a [[thesis by publication]], and publicly defending the thesis. Customary doctorates do not exist even in the field of medicine: physicians hold the degree of ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen lisensiaatti'' ([[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of Medicine), and are referred to simply as ''l\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' (physician); \"tohtori\" would be rustic or old-fashioned. A research doctorate in medicine, ''l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteen tohtori'', requires further research work and a separate doctoral thesis, and is not taken by all medical graduates. Regardless, in Finnish usage, the use of titles is uncommon and restricted to only the most formal of contexts.\n\n====France====\n\nIn [[France]], the title of ''Docteur'' is only used generally for [[physician]]s (''m\u00e9decin'') and [[dentist]]s (''chirurgiens-dentistes'') but can also be used by [[pharmacist]]s, along with holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a [[doctorate]], which in France is used only to refer to a research doctorate, but a \"State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine\" (''Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat de docteur en m\u00e9decine'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vocabulaire-medical.fr/encyclopedie/035-docteur-medecin|title=Un m\u00e9decin est toujours \" docteur \" ; un \" docteur \" n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement un m\u00e9decin|language=French|work=Vocabulaire m\u00e9dical|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe law in France allows the title of Dr to be used professionally by the above medical professionals and by holders of research doctorates, with the field of their speciality being mentioned after the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2013/7/22/2013-660/jo/article_78|title=LOI n\u00b0 2013-660 du 22 juillet 2013 relative \u00e0 l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 la recherche|at=TITRE VI : LES PERSONNELS DE L'ENSEIGNEMENT SUP\u00c9RIEUR ET DE LA RECHERCHE Article 78|website=Legifrance|publisher=[[Government of France]]|language=French}}</ref> The courts have ruled that stating the specialisation is not necessary except in circumstances specifically related to professional practice; at other times the title alone may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opimed.org/spip.php?article108|title=Du bon usage du titre de docteur|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=OpiMed|publisher=MediaMed|language=French}}</ref> The courts have also determined that questioning the right of the holder of a research doctorate to use the title Dr is a form of libel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hervecausse.info/Le-titre-de-docteur-n-appartient-pas-aux-medecins--N-est-pas-docteur-qui-veut-et-qui-l-est-a-son-honneur--Mise-au_a249.html|title=Le titre de \u00abdocteur\u00bb n\u2019appartient pas aux m\u00e9decins!

(economic and political sciences, also as Dr. rer. oec. in Switzerland), ''[[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]]'' (engineering), and ''Dr. theol.'' (theology). All holders of doctoral degrees are appropriately addressed as \"Herr/Frau Dr. _____\" in all social situations.\n\nIn Germany, double doctorates are indicated in the title by ''\"Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDr.\"'' and triple doctorates as ''\"Dr. Dr. Dr.\"'' or ''\"DDDr.\"''. More doctorates are indicated by the addition of ''\"mult.\"'', such as ''\"Dr. mult.\"''. Honorary titles are shown with the addition of ''\"h.c.\"'', which stands for ''\"honoris causa\"''. Example: ''\"Dr. h.c. mult.\"''\n\nAll people holding a doctorate from an EU member state are, since 2001, entitled to use \"Doctor\" or \"Dr.\" in all formal, legal and published communications without any further addenda. For academics with doctorates from non-EU member states, the qualification must be recognised formally (\"validated\") by the Federal Educational Ministry in Bonn. The recognition process can be done by the employer or employee and may be part of the official bureaucracy for confirming professional status and is dependent on individual bilateral agreements between Germany and other countries and, since 2007, the Lisbon Recognition Convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/lisbon_convention.php |title=Lisbon Convention|website=Recognition in Germany|publisher=Federal Ministry of Education and Research|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> An example of mutual recognition of Doctor titles among EU countries is the \"Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994\", signed between Germany and Spain (prior to the general recognition of EU doctorates).<ref>[http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&id=1995/12243&codmap= Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado.

Completing a PhD research programme (or DLA in arts and music) also leads to the doctor title. Since 2008, also those who graduated of five-year [[pharmacy]] schools have the right to use the title \"dr\" (''dr. pharm.'').\n\nA large part of Hungarians with doctor titles received their titles for research in the old academic system before PhD was introduced in Hungary. Since the introduction of PhD title (1993), the ''dr. univ'' title (given before 1993). The CSc ''Candidate of Science'' title was a scientific title in the old academic system and is now treated as an equivalent of PhD. CSc titles were awarded by the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].\n\nBefore 1989, juris doctors were allowed to use the Dr. title in their name.\n\nThe highest level doctoral degree in Hungary is DSc ''Doctor of Sciences'', awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. It is also called ''Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''.\n\nThe title of doctor used to become a part of the name and was added as such to personal identity documents. This practice is still common and graduates after receiving their diploma would usually change their personal documents in order to officially indicate the achievement.\n\n====Ireland====\nUsage in Ireland is similar to that in the UK.

(1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed 26 May 2008.</ref> and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the Ph.D., and now that it is part of the E.U. [[Bologna Process]], a new three-year first degree, or \"laurea\" (equivalent to a B.A. of other countries), has been introduced. The old-style \"laurea\" is now known as \"laurea magistrale/specialistica\" (Bologna Process second cycle/[[ISCED]] 2011 Level 7). For historical reasons, even to this day, the title of \"dottore/dottoressa\" (abbrev. both as dott/dott.ssa or as dr./dr.ssa ) is awarded even to those who have studied for a \"laurea\". Upper levels of degree are anyway shown in the title, as those who obtain a master's degree can be referred to as \"dottore/dottoressa magistrale\" (masterly doctor) while those who achieve the relatively new program of \"dottorato di ricerca\" (research doctorate, equivalent of a Ph.D.), carry the title of \"dottore/dottoressa di ricerca\" (research doctor), which can be abbreviated as \"Dott. Ric.\" or \"Ph.D.\"<ref>L. n. 240 \u2013 30 December 2010, G.U. n. 10\u201314 January 2011, Art. 8-bis.</ref>\n\n====Malta====\nIn [[Malta]], the title of Doctor is used by academic doctors (with Ph.D.s), medical practitioners, dentists and lawyers. Its use by lawyers is due to the qualifying degree for practicing law having been the [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] until reforms in 2014, and has been described as \"historical baggage\" by the Dean of the [[University of Malta]]'s law school. Lawyers do not generally use the title when practicing outside of Malta.<ref>{{cite news|work=Times of Malta|date=11 January 2014|author= Ivan Martin|title=\u2018I am not a doctor, so why call myself one?\u2019|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140111/local/-I-am-not-a-doctor-so-why-call-myself-one-.502162}}</ref>\n\n====The Netherlands====\nIn the [[Dutch language]] the word \"dokter\" refers to a physician, whereas \"doctor\" refers to the academic title. The doctor title is abbreviated as dr. placed before the holders name (note the lowercase).\n\nTo enter a Dutch doctoral defense, the candidate must hold a validated master's degree (a master's degree of an acknowledged university, or a master equivalent degree validated on a case by case basis by the Dutch government). In some cases the candidate can be granted special dispensation if no master's degree is held.\nThere is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. Once the doctorate is obtained the preceding master's degree is generally no longer reported. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering \"ir.\" (\"ingenieur\", i.e. Engineer) and law \"mr.\" (\"meester\", i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. is added to the original master title. For these disciplines, the original master's degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example \"dr. ir. Familyman\". The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr., see e.g. [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]). For a person having a law master's degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. title (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as \"dokter\" (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician a title equivalent to that of PhD.\n\nConfusion can be caused by the original Dutch Master level title \"drs.\" (for all non-engineering and non-law master's degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title [[doctorandus]] Latin for \"he who should become a doctor\" (female form is \"doctoranda\"). Dutch drs. should not be confused with the plural 'doctorates': having a PhD in multiple disciplines. Once a doctorate is achieved the doctorandus is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.<br>\nStacking of multiples titles of the same level, as seen in countries like for example Germany (Dr. Dr. Dr. Musterfrau) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands (although stacking of titles with different levels is common: prof. dr. ir. Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.\n\nAfter obtaining a doctorate successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a PhD title has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to no meaning or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.\n\nHistorically, The Netherlands used their own academic degree nomenclature, but for many years now have recognised and implemented the [[Bologna declaration]]. In everyday practice, the Anglo Saxon titles (e.g. PhD) are frequently used. Dutch academic titles are legally protected. PhD degrees can only be granted by recognised (research) universities. Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009 |title=Art. 435 Sr |language=Dutch |publisher=Wetten.overheid.nl |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.nl/translate?prev=hp&js=y&u=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_21-10-2009&sl=nl&tl=en&history_state0=&swap=1 |title=Art. 435 Sr (translated by Google) |language=Dutch |publisher=Translate.google.nl|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\nIn [[Portugal]], up to recent times after the completion of an undergraduate degree \u2013 except in [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] \u2013 a person was referred to as ''doutor (Dr.) \u2013 male'' or ''doutora (Dra.) \u2013 female''. The architects and engineers were referred by their professional titles: ''arquitecto'' (Arq.) and ''engenheiro'' (Eng.). [[Nurse]]s are also referred to as \"nurse\", ''enfermeiro'' (male) or ''enfermeira'' (female), the title being ''Enf.'' for both.\n\nNowadays Portugal is a signatory to the [[Bologna process]] and according to the current legislation the title of Doctor (''doutor, doutora'') is reserved for graduate holders of an academic [[doctorate]].<ref>Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 107/2008, de 25 de Junho</ref> Professions such as [[physician]]s, [[Attorney at law|attorneys]], [[pharmacist]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, and few others are usually referred to by the title Dr. (doutor) even if they have not been awarded a doctoral degree.\n\nHowever, custom gives the legislation little strength and most graduates use the Dr. title in its abbreviated form, although use of the full ''Doutor'' is normally restricted to those with doctorates.. Those who are both holders of an academic doctorate and Professors at a college level are generally referred to as Professor Doutor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.university.pt/phd-in-portugal/|title=PhD in Portugal|website=University.pt|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\nThe social standing of Doctors in Spain is evidenced by the fact that only [[Ph.D.]] holders, [[Grandees]] and [[Duke]]s can take seat and cover their heads in the presence of the King.<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.protocolo.org/gest_web/proto_Seccion.pl?rfID=459&arefid=2871&pag=8 Ra\u00edces de las normas y tradiciones del protocolo y ceremonial universitario actual: las universidades del Antiguo R\u00e9gimen y los actos de colaci\u00f3n.

It may also be awarded for outstanding achievement in a particular field.  This service or achievement does not need to be academic in nature. Often, the same set of degrees is used for higher doctorates, but they are distinguished as being ''honoris causa'': in comprehensive lists, the lettering used to indicate the possession of a higher doctorate is often adjusted to indicate this, for example, \"Hon. Sc.D.\", as opposed to the earned research doctorate \"[[Sc.D.]]\". The degrees of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) and [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.), however, are only awarded as honorary degrees.\n\nBy convention, recipients of honorary doctorates do not use the title \"Dr\" in general correspondence, although in formal correspondence from the university issuing the honorary degree it is normal to address the recipient by the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/history|title=The Honorary Degree|publisher=[[West Virginia University]]|quote=[H]onorary degree recipients should not refer to themselves as \"Doctor\", nor should they use the title on business cards or in correspondence.

They were produced as [[memento mori|mementos mori]], to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04617a.htm | title=Dance of Death | date=2007-02-20 | work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}</ref> Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme was a now-lost mural at [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]] in Paris dating from 1424 to 1425.\n\n==Paintings==\nThe earliest recorded visual example is the lost mural on the south wall of the cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris, which was painted in 1424-25 during the regency of [[John, Duke of Bedford]]: with its emphatic inclusion of a dead crowned king at a time when France did not have a crowned king, the mural may well have had a political subtext.<ref>Oosterwijk (2008)</ref> There were also painted schemes in [[Basel]] (the earliest dating from c.1440); a series of paintings on canvas by [[Bernt Notke]], in [[L\u00fcbeck]] (1463); the initial fragment of the original Bernt Notke painting (accomplished at the end of the 15th century) in the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St Nicholas' Church]], [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] ([[Danse Macabre (Notke)|Danse Macabre]]); the painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv.

Paris, [[Guy Marchant]], 1486]]\n\nThe deathly [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|horrors of the 14th century]] such as recurring [[famine]]s, the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[France]], and, most of all, the [[Black Death]], were culturally assimilated throughout Europe. The omnipresent possibility of sudden and painful death increased the religious desire for [[penance]], but it also evoked a hysterical desire for amusement while still possible; a last dance as cold comfort. The danse macabre combines both desires: in many ways similar to the mediaeval [[mystery play]]s, the dance-with-death allegory was originally a [[didacticism|didactic]] dialogue poem to remind people of the inevitability of death and to advise them strongly to be prepared at all times for death (see ''[[memento mori]]'' and ''[[Ars moriendi]]'').\n\nShort verse dialogues between Death and each of its victims, which could have been performed as plays, can be found in the direct aftermath of the Black Death in [[Germany]] and in [[Spain]]  (where it was known as the ''Totentanz'' and ''la Danza de la Muerte'', respectively). The French term ''danse macabre'' may derive from the Latin ''Chorea Machab\u00e6orum'', literally \"dance of the Maccabees.\"<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233217?rskey=m8A5At&result=1&isAdvanced=false# OED.com]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/macabre Dictionary.reference.com]</ref> In [[2 Maccabees]], a [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of the [[Bible]], the grim [[martyr]]dom of a [[woman with seven sons|mother and her seven sons]] is described and was a well-known mediaeval subject. It is possible that the Maccabean Martyrs were commemorated in some early French plays or that people just associated the book's vivid descriptions of the martyrdom with the interaction between Death and its prey.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the term entered France via Spain, the {{lang-ar |\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0631}}, ''maqabir'' (cemetery) being the root of the word. Both the dialogues and the evolving paintings were ostensive penitential lessons that even illiterate people (who were the overwhelming majority) could understand.\n[[File:Trionfo della morte - Chiesa S. Maria Annunciata - Bienno (ph Luca Giarelli).jpg|300px|thumb|left|Danse macabre in St Maria in [[Bienno]].]]\n\n==Frescoes==\n[[Fresco]]es and murals dealing with death had a long tradition and were widespread, e.g. the legend of the Three Living and the Three Dead: on a ride or hunt, three young gentlemen meet three cadavers (sometimes described as their ancestors) who warn them, ''Quod fuimus, estis; quod sumus, vos eritis'' (What we were, you are; what we are, you will be). Numerous mural versions of that legend from the 13th century onwards have survived (for instance, in the [[:de:Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Wismar)|Hospital Church]] of [[Wismar]] or the residential [[Longthorpe Tower]] outside [[Peterborough]]). Since they showed pictorial sequences of men and corpses covered with shrouds, those paintings are sometimes regarded as cultural precursors of the new genre.\n\nA ''danse macabre'' painting may show a round dance headed by Death or a chain of alternating dead and live dancers. From the highest ranks of the mediaeval hierarchy (usually [[pope]] and [[emperor]]) descending to its lowest (beggar, peasant, and child), each mortal's hand is taken by a skeleton or an extremely decayed body. The famous ''Totentanz'' by Bernt Notke in [[St. Mary's Church, L\u00fcbeck]] (destroyed during the Allied [[bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II]]), presented the dead dancers as very lively and agile, making the impression that they were actually dancing, whereas their living dancing partners looked clumsy and passive. The apparent class distinction in almost all of these paintings is completely neutralized by Death as the ultimate equalizer, so that a sociocritical element is subtly inherent to the whole genre. The ''Totentanz'' of [[Metnitz]], for example, shows how a pope crowned with his [[mitre]] is being led into Hell by the dancing Death.\n\n{{Wide image|Totentanz L\u00fcbeckR.jpg|2000px|''L\u00fcbecker Totentanz'' by [[Bernt Notke]] (around 1463, destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942)|alt=A mural depicting a chain of alternating living and dead dancers}}\n\nUsually, a short dialogue is attached to each victim, in which Death is summoning him (or, more rarely, her) to dance and the summoned is moaning about impending death. In the first printed ''Totentanz'' textbook (Anon.: Vierzeiliger oberdeutscher Totentanz, Heidelberger Blockbuch, approx. 1460), Death addresses, for example, the emperor:\n[[File:Bernt Notke Danse Macabre.jpg|thumb|500px|Bernt Notke: ''Surmatants'' (''Totentanz'') in [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn]].]]  \n[[File:Totentanz in Hrastovlje.JPG|thumb|The famous Danse Macabre in [[Hrastovlje]] in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church]]]]\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nEmperor, your sword won't help you out\nSceptre and crown are worthless here\nI've taken you by the hand\nFor you must come to my dance\n</poem>}}\n\nAt the lower end of the ''Totentanz'', Death calls, for example, the peasant to dance, who answers:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nI had to work very much and very hard\nThe sweat was running down my skin\nI'd like to escape death nonetheless\nBut here I won't have any luck\n</poem>}}\n\nThe dance finishes (or sometimes starts) with a summary of the allegory's main point:\n\n{{Verse translation|lang=de|\nWer war der Tor, wer der Weise,\nWer der Bettler oder Kaiser?\nOb arm, ob reich, im Tode gleich.\n|\nWho was the fool, who the wise man,\nwho the beggar or the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]]?\nWhether rich or poor, [all are] equal in death.\n}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Totentanz Maria im Fels Beram.JPG|The painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv.

They were cut in wood by the accomplished [[Formschneider]] (block cutter) [[Hans L\u00fctzelburger]].  William Ivins (quoting W.J. Linton) writes of L\u00fctzelburger's work: \"'Nothing indeed, by knife or by graver, is of higher quality than this man's doing,' for by common acclaim the originals are technically the most marvelous woodcuts ever made.\" <ref>Ivins, p.234.</ref>  These woodcuts soon appeared in proofs with titles in German.  The first book edition, containing forty-one woodcuts, was published at Lyons by the Treschsel brothers in 1538.  The popularity of the work and the currency of its message are underscored by the fact that there were eleven editions before 1562 and over the sixteenth century perhaps as many as a hundred unauthorized editions and imitations.<ref>Clark (1947), p.32</ref>  Ten further designs were added in later editions.\n\nThe ''Dance of Death'' (1523\u201326) refashions the late-medieval [[allegory]] of the ''danse macabre'' as a reformist satire, and one can see the beginnings of a gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion.<ref>Wilson, 96\u2013103.</ref>  That shift had many permutations however, and in a thoroughly detailed study Natalie Zemon Davis has shown that the contemporary reception and afterlife of Holbein's designs lent themselves to neither purely Catholic or Protestant doctrine, but could be outfitted with different surrounding prefaces and sermons as printers and writers of different political and religious leanings took them up.  Most importantly, it was \"The pictures and the Bible quotations above them were the main attractions ... Both Catholics and Protestants wished, through the pictures, to turn men's thoughts to a Christian preparation for death.\".<ref>Davis, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe 1538 edition which contained Latin quotations from the Bible above Holbein's designs, and a French quatrain below composed by [[Gilles Corrozet]], actually did not credit Holbein as the artist.  It bore the title: Les simulachres & / HISTORIEES FACES / DE LA MORT, AUTANT ELE/gamm\u0113t pourtraictes, que artifi/ciellement imagin\u00e9es. / A Lyon. / Soubz l'escu de COLOIGNE. / M.D. XXXVIII. (\"Images and Illustrated facets of Death, as elegantly depicted as they are artfully conceived.\")<ref>See External links to access to this work, including English translation, online.</ref>  These images and workings of death as captured in the phrase \"historiees faces\" of the title \"are the particular exemplification of the way death works, the individual scenes in which the lessons of mortality are brought home to people of every station.\" <ref>Gundersheimer, introduction, p.xi.</ref>  In his preface to the work Jean de Vauz\u00e8le, the Prior of Montrosier, addresses Jehanne de Tourzelle, the Abbess of the Convent at St. Peter at Lyons, and names Holbein's attempts to capture the ever-present, but never directly seen, abstract images of death \"simulachres.\"  He writes: \"... simulachres les dis ie vrayement, pour ce que simulachre vient de simuler, & faindre ce que n'est point.\" (\"Simulachre they are most correctly called, for simulachre derives from the verb to simulate and to feign that which is not really there.\")  He next employs a trope from the [[memento mori]] (remember we all must die) tradition and a metaphor from printing which well captures the undertakings of Death, the artist, and the printed book before us in which these simulachres of death barge in on the living: \"Et pourtant qu'on n'a peu trouver chose plus approchante a la similitude de Mort, que la personne morte, on d'icelle effigie simulachres, & faces de Mort, pour en nos pensees imprimer la memoire de Mort plus au vis, que ne pourroient toutes les rhetoriques descriptiones de orateurs.\" <ref>As reproduced in Gundersheimer, 1971. p.5. Register Aiii of original.</ref> (\"And yet we cannot discover any one thing more near the likeness of Death than the dead themselves, whence come these simulated effigies and images of Death's affairs, which imprint the memory of Death with more force than all the rhetorical descriptions of the orators ever could.\").\n\n[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 15.jpg|left|thumb|Hans Holbein, Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.

None escape Death's skeletal clutches, not even the pious.<ref>B\u00e4tschmann & Griener, 56\u201358, and Landau & Parshall, 216.</ref>  As Davis writes, \"Holbein's pictures are independent dramas in which Death comes upon his victim in the midst of the latter's own surroundings and activities.<ref>Davis, p.101</ref>  This is perhaps nowhere more strikingly captured than in the wonderful blocks showing the plowman earning his bread by the sweat of his brow only to have his horses speed him to his end by Death.  The Latin from the 1549 Italian edition pictured here reads: \"In sudore vultus tui, vesceris pane tuo.\" (\"Through the sweat of thy brow you shall eat your bread\"), quoting Genesis 3.19.  The Italian verses below translate: (\"Miserable in the sweat of your brow,/ It is necessary that you acquire the bread you need eat,/ But, may it not displease you to come with me,/ If you are desirous of rest.\").   Or there is the nice balance in composition Holbein achieves between the heavy-laden traveling salesman insisting that he must still go to market while Death tugs at his sleeve to put down his wares once and for all: \"Venite ad me, qui onerati estis.\" (\"Come to me, all ye who [labor and] are heavy laden\"), quoting Matthew 11.28.  The Italian here translates: (\"Come with me, wretch, who are weighed down,/ Since I am the dame who rules the whole world:/ Come and hear my advice,/ Because I wish to lighten you of this load.\").<ref>Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.

One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand\": signified over signifier; intelligible over sensible; speech over writing; activity over passivity, etc. The first task of deconstruction would be to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or a corpus of texts; but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions, because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense. The oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all. The hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Deconstruction only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and arbitrary violence intrinsic to all texts.<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|41}}\n\nFinally, Derrida argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position, \"thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively\".<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|42}} To be effective, deconstruction needs to create new terms, not to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction, not as a free play but as a pure necessity of analysis, to better mark the intervals. Derrida called undecidables\u2014that is, unities of simulacrum\u2014\"false\" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, but which, however, inhabit philosophical oppositions\u2014resisting and organizing it\u2014without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of Hegelian dialectics (e.g., [[diff\u00e9rance]], [[archi-writing]], [[Pharmakon (philosophy)|pharmakon]], supplement, hymen, gram, spacing).<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\n==Influences==\nDerrida's theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure (whose writings on [[semiotics]] also became a cornerstone of structuralist theory in the mid-20th century) and literary theorists such as [[Roland Barthes]] (whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought). Derrida's views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist [[Jacques Lacan]], and linguist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. However, Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as \"[[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]]\".{{Citation needed|reason=Correct but this entire paragraph needs references.|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Influence of Nietzsche===\nIn order to understand Derrida's motivation, one must refer to Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nNietzsche's project began with Orpheus, the man underground. This foil to Platonic light was deliberately and self-consciously lauded in ''Daybreak'', when Nietzsche announces, albeit retrospectively, \"In this work you will discover a subterranean man at work\", and then goes on to map the project of unreason: \"All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive? Does the good historian not, at bottom, constantly contradict?\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|last2=Clark|first2=Maudemarie|last3=Leiter|first3=Brian|last4=Hollingdale|first4=R.J.|title=Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521599636}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nNietzsche's point in ''Daybreak'' is that standing at the end of modern history, modern thinkers know too much to be deceived by the illusion of reason any more. Reason, logic, philosophy and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. And so Nietzsche decides to throw it in our faces, and uncover the truth of Plato, that he\u2014unlike Orpheus\u2014just happened to discover his true love in the light instead of in the dark. This being merely one historical event amongst many, Nietzsche proposes that we revisualize the history of the West as the history of a series of political moves, that is, a manifestation of the will to power, that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal (absolute) sense. By calling our attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of Orpheus, the man underground, in dialectical opposition to Plato, Nietzsche hopes to sensitize us to the political and cultural context, and the political influences that impact authorship. For example, the political influences that led one author to choose philosophy over poetry (or at least ''portray'' himself as having made such a choice), and another to make a different choice.\n\nThe problem with Nietzsche, as Derrida sees it, is that he did not go far enough. That he missed the fact that this will to power is itself but a manifestation of the operation of writing. And so Derrida wishes to help us step beyond Nietzsche's penultimate revaluation of all western values, to the ultimate, which is the final appreciation of \"the role of writing in the production of knowledge\".<ref name=\"Zuckert\"/>\n\n===Influence of Saussure===\nDerrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all [[discourse]] has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of [[difference (philosophy)|difference]] inside a \"system of distinct signs\". This approach to text is influenced by the [[semiology]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Royle|first1=Nick|title=Jacques Derrida|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415229319|pages=6\u2013623|edition=Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC&pg=PA62|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|last2=Ferraris|first2=Maurizio|title=A Taste for the Secret|date=2001|publisher=Wiley|location=|isbn=9780745623344|page=76|quote=I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration; but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is every where there is a relation to another thing or relation to an other. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}</ref>\n\nSaussure is considered one of the fathers of [[structuralism]] when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:\n\n<blockquote>In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.<ref name=\"Saussure\"/></blockquote>\n\nSaussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, a science of signs in general, human codes being only one part. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, Saussure made linguistics \"the regulatory model\", and \"for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone\".<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|21, 46, 101, 156, 164}} Derrida will prefer to follow the more \"fruitful paths (formalization)\" of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered \"a hierarchizing teleology\" privileging linguistics, and to speak of \"mark\" rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.\n\n==Deconstruction according to Derrida==\n\n===Etymology===\nDerrida's original use of the word \"deconstruction\" was a translation of ''[[Destruktion]]'', a concept from the work of [[Martin Heidegger]] that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger's term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them.<ref name=\"Heidegger\">{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|last2=Macquarrie|first2=John|last3=Robinson|first3=Edward|title=Being and Time|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9780631197706|pages=21\u201323|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S57m5gW0L-MC|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Basic philosophical concerns===\nDerrida's concerns flow from a consideration of several issues:\n\n# A desire to contribute to the re-evaluation of all Western values, a re-evaluation built on the 18th-century Kantian critique of pure reason, and carried forward to the 19th century, in its more radical implications, by [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].\n# An assertion that texts outlive their authors, and become part of a set of cultural habits equal to, if not surpassing, the importance of authorial intent.\n# A re-valuation of certain classic western dialectics: poetry vs. philosophy, reason vs. revelation, structure vs. creativity, [[episteme]] vs. [[techne]], etc.\n\nTo this end, Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers, who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition.<ref name=\"Zuckert\">{{cite book|last1=Zuckert|first1=Catherine H.|title=Postmodern Platos: Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Strauss, Derrida|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226993310|chapter=7}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2017}} Like Nietzsche, Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project, namely the education, through critical reflections, of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However, like Nietzsche, Derrida is not satisfied merely with such a political interpretation of Plato, because of the particular dilemma modern humans find themselves in. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity, hence the attempt to be something beyond the modern, because of this Nietzschian sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism.\n\n===Diff\u00e9rance===\n{{Main|Diff\u00e9rance}}\nDiff\u00e9rance is the observation that the meanings of words come from their [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchrony]] with other words within the language and their [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachrony]] between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language, according to Derrida, requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the [[etymological fallacy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Soskice|first1=Janet Martin|title=Metaphor and Religious Language|date=1987|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198249825|pages=80\u201382|edition=Paperback}}</ref>\n\nThere is one statement by Derrida\u2014in an essay on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in ''[[Of Grammatology]]''\u2014which has been of great interest to his opponents.<ref name=\"Derrida\"/>{{rp|158}} It is the assertion that \"there is no outside-text\" (''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''),<ref name=\"Derrida\"/>{{rp|158\u201359, 163}} which is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside of the text\". The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. [[Michel Foucault]], for instance, famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase \"Il n'y a rien en dehors du texte\" for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|last2=Howard|first2=Richard|last3=Cooper|first3=David|title=Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415253853|page=602|edition=Reprint}}</ref> According to Derrida, his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of diff\u00e9rance.<ref name=\"Limited\">{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|title=[[Limited Inc]]|date=1995|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston|isbn=0810107880|edition=4th}}</ref>{{rp|133}}\n\nFor example, the word \"house\" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from \"shed\", \"mansion\", \"hotel\", \"building\", etc. (Form of Content, that [[Louis Hjelmslev]] distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word \"house\" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e., the relationship between [[signified and signifier]]), with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition: when can we talk about a \"house\" or a \"mansion\" or a \"shed\"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the languages in the world: when should we stop saying \"walk\" and start saying \"run\"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying \"yellow\" and start saying \"orange\", or exchange \"past\" for \"present\"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by diff\u00e9rance.\n\nThus, complete meaning is always \"differential\" and ''postponed'' in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end.\n\n===Metaphysics of presence===\n{{Main|Metaphysics of presence}}\nDerrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence, or ''logocentrism'' in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning, the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another, such as good over bad, speech over the written word, male over female. Derrida writes, \"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia, on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite\".<ref name=\"Heidegger\"/>{{rp|29\u201367}} To Derrida, the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who, in ''[[Being and Time]]'', claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Deconstruction and dialectics===\nIn the deconstruction procedure, one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel's dialectic, where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis.<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|43}} The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the 20th century, with the influence of Koj\u00e8ve and Hyppolite, but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists, and including the existentialism of Sartre, etc. This explains Derrida's concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel's,<ref name=\"Derrida2\"/>{{rp|43}} since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis, while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction.\n\n==Difficulty of definition==\nThere have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is,<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|4}} and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it.\n\n===Derrida's \"negative\" descriptions===\nDerrida has been more forthcoming with negative ([[wikt:apophatic|apophatic]]) than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by [[Toshihiko Izutsu]] some preliminary considerations on how to translate \"deconstruction\" in Japanese, in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to deconstruction's actual meaning, Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to \"what deconstruction is not, or rather ''ought'' not to be\".<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=David|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Robert|title=Derrida and Siff\u00e9rance|date=1988|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Illinois|isbn=9780810107861|edition=Reprinted}}</ref>{{rp|1}}\n\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis, a critique, or a method<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction, Derrida is seeking to \"multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis, a critique, or a method, because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms, he reaffirms \"the necessity of returning to them, at least under erasure\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} Derrida's necessity of returning to a term [[sous rature|under erasure]] means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida's preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction\u2014as, for example, a critique\u2014then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique.\n\n====Not a method====\nDerrida states that \"Deconstruction is not a method, and cannot be transformed into one\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation, when he states that \"It is true that in certain circles (university or cultural, especially in the United States) the technical and methodological \"metaphor\" that seems necessarily attached to the very word 'deconstruction' has been able to seduce or lead astray\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that\n\n<blockquote>Derrida is careful to avoid this term [method] because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided ''how'' to proceed, is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand, is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida [...] this is irresponsibility itself. Thus, to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction, especially regarding its ethico-political implications, would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida's philosophical adventure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beardsworth|first1=Richard|title=Derrida & The Political|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1134837380|page=4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBeardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction, because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading, because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find.\n\n====Not a critique====\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not a [[critique]] in the Kantian sense.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} This is because [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defines the term critique as the opposite of [[dogmatism]]. For Derrida, it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language we use in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of [[Sign (linguistics)|signifiers]] that only refer to that which transcends them\u2014the signified.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In addition, Derrida asks rhetorically \"Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical?\"<ref name=\"Allison\"/>{{rp|5}} By this, Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something ''is'' the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence desediment dogmatism in general, but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once.\n\n====Not an analysis====\nDerrida states that deconstruction is not an [[analysis]] in the traditional sense.<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self-sufficient units of meaning in a text, because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida's theory of meaning see the article on [[diff\u00e9rance]].\n\n====Not post-structuralist====\nDerrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which \"[[structuralism]] was dominant\" and deconstruction's meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an \"antistructuralist gesture\" because \"[s]tructures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented\". At the same time, deconstruction is also a \"structuralist gesture\" because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So, deconstruction involves \"a certain attention to structures\"<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|2}} and tries to \"understand how an 'ensemble' was constituted\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture, deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the \"structural problematic\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|2}} The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis, that which is \"in the essential mode of creation or movement\", and structure: \"systems, or complexes, or static configurations\".<ref name=\"Writing\"/>{{rp|194}} An example of genesis would be the [[sense|sensory]] [[idea]]s from which knowledge is then derived in the [[empirical]] [[epistemology]]. An example of structure would be a [[binary opposition]] such as [[good and evil]] where the meaning of each element is established, at least partly, through its relationship to the other element.\n\nIt is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from [[post-structuralism]], a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that \"the motif of deconstruction has been associated with 'post-structuralism{{' \"}}, but that this term was \"a word unknown in France until its 'return' from the United States\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>{{rp|3}} In his deconstruction of Husserl, Derrida actually argues {{em|for}} the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. [[Manfred Frank]] has even referred to Derrida's work as \"Neostructuralism\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Manfred|title=What is Neostructuralism?|date=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0816616027}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Alternative definitions===\nThe popularity of the term deconstruction, combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida's primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term, has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida's actual position.\n\n* [[Paul de Man]] was a member of the [[Yale School]] and a prominent practitioner of deconstruction as he understood it. His definition of deconstruction is that, \"[i]t's possible, within text, to frame a question or undo assertions made in the text, by means of elements which are in the text, which frequently would be precisely structures that play off the rhetorical against grammatical elements.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moynihan|first1=Robert|title=A Recent imagining: interviews with Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman, J.

Caputo]] attempts to explain deconstruction in a nutshell by stating:<blockquote>\"Whenever deconstruction finds a nutshell\u2014a secure axiom or a pithy maxim\u2014the very idea is to crack it open and disturb this tranquility. Indeed, that is a good rule of thumb in deconstruction. ''That'' is what deconstruction is all about, its very meaning and mission, if it has any. One might even say that cracking nutshells is what deconstruction ''is''. In a nutshell. ...Have we not run up against a paradox and an [[aporia]] [something contradictory]...the paralysis and impossibility of an aporia is just what impels deconstruction, what rouses it out of bed in the morning...\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caputo|first1=John D.|title=Deconstruction in a Nutshell: A Conversation with Jacques Derrida|date=1997|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780823217557|page=32|edition=3rd}}</ref></blockquote>\n* [[Niall Lucy]] points to the impossibility of defining the term at all, stating: <blockquote>\"While in a sense it ''is'' impossibly difficult to define, the impossibility has less to do with the adoption of a position or the assertion of a choice on deconstruction's part than with the impossibility of every 'is' as such. Deconstruction begins, as it were, from a refusal of the authority or determining power of every 'is', or simply from a refusal of authority in general. While such refusal may indeed count as a position, it is not the case that deconstruction holds this as a sort of 'preference' \".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lucy|first1=Niall|title=A Derrida DIctionary|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=1405137517}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}</blockquote>\n* David B. Allison is an early translator of Derrida and states, in the introduction to his translation of ''Speech and Phenomena'': <blockquote>[Deconstruction] signifies a project of critical thought whose task is to locate and 'take apart' those concepts which serve as the axioms or rules for a period of thought, those concepts which command the unfolding of an entire epoch of metaphysics. 'Deconstruction' is somewhat less negative than the Heideggerian or Nietzschean terms 'destruction' or 'reversal'; it suggests that certain foundational concepts of metaphysics will never be entirely eliminated...There is no simple 'overcoming' of metaphysics or the language of metaphysics.</blockquote>\n* [[Paul Ric\u0153ur]] defines deconstruction as a way of uncovering the questions behind the answers of a text or tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Anne Carolyn|title=Meeting the Great Bliss Queen: Buddhists, Feminists, and the Art of the Self|date=1994|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807073063}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}\n* Richard Ellmann defines 'deconstruction' as the systematic undoing of understanding.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy that Derrida is working in.

His way of achieving this was by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, with an ear to what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the [[aporia]]s and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sallis|first1=John|authorlink=John Sallis|title=Deconstruction and Philosophy: The Texts of Jacques Derrida|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226734390|pages=3\u20134|edition=Paperback|quote=One of the more persistent misunderstandings that has thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derrida's philosophical thought is the assumption, shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics, that within that thought just anything is possible. Derrida's philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation, traditional requirements of thought, and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community. Undoubtedly, some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect, and may have contributed, however obliquely, to fostering to some extent that very misconception. But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derrida's thinking, reveals to even a superficial examination, a well-ordered procedure, a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions, a marked thoroughness and regularity. [...] Deconstruction must be understood, we contend, as the attempt to \"account,\" in a certain manner, for a heterogeneous variety or manifold of nonlogical contradictions and discursive equalities of all sorts that continues to haunt and fissure even the ''successful'' development of philosophical arguments and their systematic exposition}}</ref>\n\nDeconstruction denotes the [[Hermeneutics|pursuing of the meaning]] of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded\u2014supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy, in [[literary analysis]], and even in the analysis of scientific writings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=Marian|author-link=Marian Hobson|title=Jacques Derrida: Opening Lines|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134774449|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kl146cNpzNQC&pg=PA51|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings; that any text therefore has more than one interpretation; that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably; that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible; and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an \"aporia\" in the text; thus, deconstructive reading is termed \"aporetic.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Currie|first1=M.|title=The Invention of Deconstruction|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137307033|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i3ecdVgknGkC&pg=PA80|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mantzavinos|first1=C.|title=Hermeneutics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/#Semiotics|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=2016}}</ref>\n\nDerrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name \"deconstruction\", on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless, he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach, and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way.\n\n===Critique of structuralism===\nDerrida's lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]], \"[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]\", often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida's essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs, composed of a signified (the meaning) and a signifier (the word itself). Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs, existing only in relation to each other, and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of [[diff\u00e9rance]].<ref>Derrida, \"Structure, Sign, and Play\" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey & Donato (1970)</ref>\n\n==Development after Derrida==\n\n===The Yale School===\n{{Further|Yale school}}\nBetween the late 1960s and the early 1980s, many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction, including [[Paul de Man]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], and [[J. Hillis Miller]]. This group came to be known as the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale school]] and was especially influential in [[literary criticism]]. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the [[University of California Irvine|University of California, Irvine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tisch|first1=Maude|title=A critical distance|url=http://yaleherald.com/news-and-features/a-critical-distance/|website=The Yale Herald|accessdate=2017-01-27}}</ref>\n\nMiller has described deconstruction this way: \"Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock, but thin air.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=J. Hillis|title=STEVENS' ROCK AND CRITICISM AS CURE: In Memory of William K.

To demonstrate the [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]] of legal doctrine, these scholars often adopt a method, such as [[structuralism]] in [[linguistics]], or deconstruction in [[Continental philosophy]], to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed, expressed, and deployed.\n\nFor example, [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures, maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts, each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value, and criticized. Self and other, private and public, subjective and objective, freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history.<ref name=\"Bridge\"/>\n\n===''Deconstructing History''===\nDeconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history. In ''Deconstructing History'', [[Alun Munslow]] examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past, history, and historical practice, as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges.<ref name=\"Munslow\"/>\n\n===''The Inoperative Community''===\n[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] argues, in his 1982 book ''The Inoperative Community'', for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy's work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida.\n\n===''The Ethics of Deconstruction''===\n[[Simon Critchley]], an English philosopher, argues, in his 1992 book ''The Ethics of Deconstruction'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Critchley|first1=Simon|authorlink=Simon Critchley|title=The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas|date=2014|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780748689323|page=352|edition=3rd|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/book/9780748689323 |accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref> that Derrida's deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] that makes it ethical in the [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinasian]] understanding of the term.\n\n===''Derrida and the Political''===\nJacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida's thinking has inspired [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|Slavoj Zizek]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], [[Judith Butler]] and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought; and, as such, it has proved revolutionary in political analysis, particularly ideology critiques.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McQuillan|first1=Martin|title=The Politics of Deconstruction: Jacques Derrida and the Other of Philosophy|date=2007|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0745326749|edition=1st}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nRichard Beardsworth, developing from Critchley's ''Ethics of Deconstruction'', argues, in his 1996 ''Derrida and the Political'', that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a [[deconstruction-and-religion|theological]] approach and a technological approach, represented first of all by the work of [[Bernard Stiegler]].\n\n==Criticisms==\nDerrida was involved in a number of high-profile disagreements with prominent philosophers, including [[Michel Foucault]], [[John Searle]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Peter Kreeft]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. Most of the criticism of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and repeated elsewhere.\n\n===John Searle===\n{{See also|Limited Inc.}}\nIn the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with [[Jacques Derrida]] regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points.<ref name=\"Limited\"/>{{rp|29}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}<!--Footnote provided only sources half the claim.--> Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection ''[[Limited Inc]]''.

Consequently, some critics<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maclachlan|first1=Ian|title=Jacques Derrida: Critical Thought|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=0754608069}}</ref> have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others<ref name=\"Alfino\">{{cite journal|last1=Alfino|first1=Mark|title=Another Look at the Derrida-Searle Debate|journal=Philosophy & Rhetoric|date=1991|volume=24|issue=2|pages=143\u2013152|doi=10.2307/40237667|jstor=10.2307/40237667}}</ref> have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that \"It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions\", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was \"the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe\".<ref>[[Simon Glendinning]]. 2001. ''Arguing with Derrida''. Wiley-Blackwell. p.&nbsp;18</ref> Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosophies.\n\nThe debate began in 1972, when, in his paper \"Signature Event Context\", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the [[Illocutionary act|illocutionary act]]. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes \"force\", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a \"structure of absence\" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by \"iterability\" (the constraints on what can be said, imposed by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious, or \"parasitic\" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning, or hadn't considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, \"Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida\", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry.<ref>Gregor Campbell. 1993. \"John R. Searle\" in Irene Rima Makaryk (ed).

Jacques Derrida: opening lines. Psychology Press. pp.&nbsp;95-97</ref> Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida's having misunderstood Austin's [[type\u2013token distinction]] and having failed to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to [[performativity]]. Some critics<ref name=\"Hobson\"/> have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.\n\nDerrida, in his response to Searle ({{nowrap|\"a b c ...\"}} in ''Limited Inc''), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a ''soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e'' (a \"[[limited liability company]]\") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.<ref name=\"Limited\"/>{{rp|133}}<ref name=\"Alfino\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=Frank B.|title=Iterability and Meaning: The Searle-Derrida Debate|journal=Metaphilosophy|date=1 January 1988|volume=19|issue=1|pages=53\u201364|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x/abstract|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en|issn=1467-9973}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fish|first1=Stanley E.|title=With the Compliments of the Author: Reflections on Austin and Derrida|journal=Critical Inquiry|date=1982|volume=8|issue=4|pages=693\u2013721|doi=10.2307/1343193|jstor=10.2307/1343193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Edmond|title=Derrida, Searle, Contexts, Games, Riddles|journal=[[New Literary History]]|date=1982|volume=13|issue=3|pages=463\u2013477|doi=10.2307/468793|jstor=10.2307/468793}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Culler|first1=Jonathan|title=Convention and Meaning: Derrida and Austin|journal=New Literary History|date=1981|volume=13|issue=1|pages=15\u201330|doi=10.2307/468640|jstor=10.2307/468640}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kenaan|first1=Hagi|title=Language, philosophy and the risk of failure: rereading the debate between Searle and Derrida|journal=Continental Philosophy Review|date=2002|volume=35|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|doi=10.1023/A:1016583115826|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/dwu9j5cx8ft1jum8/|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raffel|first1=Stanley|title=Understanding Each Other: The Case of the Derrida-Searle Debate|journal=Human Studies|date=28 July 2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=277\u2013292|doi=10.1007/s10746-011-9189-6|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x16m6724k5513827/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the debate, Derrida praised Austin's work, but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls \"infelicities\" from the \"normal\" operation of language. One \"infelicity\", for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is \"sincere\" or \"merely citational\" (and therefore possibly ironic). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily \"citational\", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible \"intention\". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.\n\nDerrida argued against the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition of which Austin and Searle were paradigmatic examples.<ref name=\"Limited\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\n{{quotation| In the description of the structure called \"normal,\" \"normative,\" \"central,\" \"ideal,\"this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic.

In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensably about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.}}\n\nDerrida argued that it was problematic to establish the relation between \"nonfiction or standard discourse\" and \"fiction,\" defined as its \"parasite, \"for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place\u2014and in so doing to \"de-essentialize\" itself as it were\".<ref name=\"Limited\"/>{{rp|133}}\nHe would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:<ref name=\"Limited\"/>{{rp|133}}\n{{quotation|what is \"nonfiction standard discourse,\" what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive \"parasitism,\" is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc.)?\n<br> This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of \"nonfiction standard discourse\" and its fictional\"parasites,\" are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional.}}\n\nIn 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''.

This generalizes the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets, together with a suitably defined structure on the product set. More abstractly, one talks about the [[Product (category theory)|product in category theory]], which formalizes these notions.\n\nExamples are the product of sets (see [[Cartesian product]]), groups (described below), the [[product of rings]] and of other [[abstract algebra|algebraic structures]]. The [[product topology|product of topological spaces]] is another instance.\n\nThere is also the [[direct sum]] \u2013 in some areas this is used interchangeably, in others it is a different concept.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> is precisely just the Cartesian product, <math>\\{ (x,y) | x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math>.\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of real numbers under addition, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> still consists of <math>\\{ (x,y) | x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math>. The difference between this and the preceding example is that <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> is now a group.  We have to also say how to add their elements. This is done by letting <math>(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)</math>.\n* If we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> again consists of <math>\\{ (x,y) | x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math>.  To make this a ring, we say how their elements are added, <math>(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)</math>, and how they are multiplied <math>(a,b) (c,d) = (ac, bd)</math>.\n* However, if we think of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> as the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of real numbers, then the direct product <math>\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}</math> does not exist \u2013 naively defining <math>\\{ (x,y) | x,y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math> in a similar manner to the above examples would not result in a field since the element <math>(1,0)</math> does not have a multiplicative inverse.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can talk about the product of more than two objects, e.g. <math>\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}</math>.  We can even talk about product of infinitely many objects, e.g. <math>\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\dotsb</math>.\n\n== Group direct product ==\n{{main|Direct product of groups}}\nIn [[group (mathematics)|group theory]] one can define the direct product of two groups (''G'', \u2218) and (''H'', \u2219), denoted by ''G'' \u00d7 ''H''. For [[abelian group]]s which are written additively, it may also be called the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum of two groups]], denoted by <math>G \\oplus H</math>.\n\nIt is defined as follows:\n* the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of the elements of the new group is the ''Cartesian product'' of the sets of elements of ''G'' and ''H'', that is {(''g'', ''h''): ''g'' \u2208 ''G'', ''h'' \u2208 ''H''};\n* on these elements put an operation, defined element-wise:\n*: (''g'', ''h'') \u00d7 (''g{{'}}'', ''h' '') = (''g'' \u2218 ''g{{'}}'', ''h'' \u2219 ''h{{'}}'')\n(Note (''G'', \u2218) may be the same as (''H'', \u2219).)\n\nThis construction gives a new group. It has a [[normal subgroup]] [[isomorphic]] to ''G'' (given by the elements of the form (''g'', 1)), and one isomorphic to ''H'' (comprising the elements (1, ''h'')).\n\nThe reverse also holds, there is the following recognition theorem: If a group ''K'' contains two normal subgroups ''G'' and ''H'', such that ''K''= ''GH'' and the intersection of ''G'' and ''H'' contains only the identity, then ''K'' is isomorphic to ''G'' \u00d7 ''H''. A relaxation of these conditions, requiring only one subgroup to be normal, gives the [[semidirect product]].\n\nAs an example, take as ''G'' and ''H'' two copies of the unique (up to isomorphisms) group of order 2, ''C''<sub>2</sub>: say {1, ''a''} and {1, ''b''}. Then ''C''<sub>2</sub>\u00d7''C''<sub>2</sub> = {(1,1), (1,''b''), (''a'',1), (''a'',''b'')}, with the operation element by element. For instance, (1,''b'')*(''a'',1) = (1*''a'', ''b''*1) = (''a'',''b''), and (1,''b'')*(1,''b'') = (1,''b''<sup>2</sup>) = (1,1).\n\nWith a direct product, we get some natural [[group homomorphism]]s for free: the projection maps \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\pi_1: G \\times H \\to G\\quad \\text{by} \\quad \\pi_1(g, h) &= g \\\\\n  \\pi_2: G \\times H \\to H\\quad \\text{by} \\quad \\pi_2(g, h) &= h\n\\end{align}</math>\ncalled the '''coordinate functions'''.\n\nAlso, every homomorphism ''f'' to the direct product is totally determined by its component functions \n<math>f_i = \\pi_i \\circ f</math>.\n\nFor any group (''G'', \u2218), and any integer ''n'' \u2265 0, multiple application of the direct product gives the group of all ''n''-[[tuple]]s  ''G''<sup>''n''</sup> (for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 the trivial group). Examples:\n*'''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>\n*'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (with additional [[vector space]] structure this is called [[Euclidean space]], see below)\n\n== Direct product of modules ==\nThe direct product for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (not to be confused with the [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]]) is very similar to the one defined for groups above, using the Cartesian product with the operation of addition being componentwise, and the scalar multiplication just distributing over all the components. Starting from '''R''' we get [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the prototypical example of a real ''n''-dimensional vector space. The direct product of '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> and '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is '''R'''<sup>''m''+''n''</sup>.\n\nNote that a direct product for a finite index <math>\\prod_{i=1}^n X_i </math> is identical to the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] <math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^n X_i </math>. The direct sum and direct product differ only for infinite indices, where the elements of a direct sum are zero for all but for a finite number of entries. They are dual in the sense of [[category theory]]: the direct sum is the [[coproduct]], while the direct product is the product.\n\nFor example, consider <math>X=\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{R} </math> and <math>Y=\\bigoplus_{i=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{R}</math>, the infinite direct product and direct sum of the real numbers. Only sequences with a finite number of non-zero elements are in ''Y''. For example, (1,0,0,0,...) is in ''Y'' but (1,1,1,1,...) is not. Both of these sequences are in the direct product ''X''; in fact, ''Y'' is a proper subset of ''X'' (that is, ''Y''&nbsp;\u2282&nbsp;''X'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectProduct.html|title=Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupDirectProduct.html|title=Group Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n== Topological space direct product ==\nThe direct product for a collection of [[topological space]]s ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' in ''I'', some index set, once again makes use of the Cartesian product\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i. </math>\n\nDefining the [[topology]] is a little tricky. For finitely many factors, this is the obvious and natural thing to do: simply take as a [[basis (topology)|basis]] of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal B = \\{ U_1 \\times \\cdots \\times U_n\\ |\\ U_i\\ \\mathrm{open\\ in}\\ X_i \\}.</math>\n\nThis topology is called the [[product topology]]. For example, directly defining the product topology on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by the open sets of '''R''' (disjoint unions of open intervals), the basis for this topology would consist of all disjoint unions of open rectangles in the plane (as it turns out, it coincides with the usual [[metric space|metric]] topology).\n\nThe product topology for infinite products has a twist, and this has to do with being able to make all the projection maps continuous and to make all functions into the product  continuous if and only if all its component functions are continuous (i.e. to satisfy the categorical definition of product: the morphisms here are continuous functions): we take as a basis of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor, as before, with the proviso that all but finitely many of the open subsets are the entire factor:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal B = \\left\\{ \\prod_{i \\in I} U_i\\ \\Big|\\ (\\exists j_1,\\ldots,j_n)(U_{j_i}\\ \\mathrm{open\\ in}\\ X_{j_i})\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ (\\forall i \\neq j_1,\\ldots,j_n)(U_i = X_i) \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe more natural-sounding topology would be, in this case, to take products of infinitely many open subsets as before, and this does yield a somewhat interesting topology, the [[box topology]]. However it is not too difficult to find an example of bunch of continuous component functions whose product function is not continuous (see the separate entry box topology for an example and more). The problem which makes the twist necessary is ultimately rooted in the fact that the intersection of open sets is only guaranteed to be open for finitely many sets in the definition of topology.\n\nProducts (with the product topology) are nice with respect to preserving properties of their factors; for example, the product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff; the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of compact spaces is compact. That last one, called [[Tychonoff's theorem]], is yet another equivalence to the [[axiom of choice]].\n\nFor more properties and equivalent formulations, see the separate entry [[product topology]].\n\n== Direct product of binary relations ==\nOn the Cartesian product of two sets with [[binary relation]]s ''R'' and ''S'', define (''a'', ''b'') T (''c'', ''d'') as ''a'' ''R'' ''c'' and ''b'' ''S'' ''d''. If ''R'' and ''S'' are both [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], or [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], relation ''T'' has the same property.<ref>[http://cr.yp.to/2005-261/bender1/EO.pdf Equivalence and Order]</ref> Combining properties it follows that this also applies for being a [[preorder]] and being an [[equivalence relation]]. However, if ''R'' and ''S'' are [[total relation]]s, ''T'' is in general not.\n\n== Direct product in universal algebra ==\nIf \u03a3 is a fixed [[Signature (logic)|signature]], ''I'' is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) index set, and ('''A'''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> is an [[indexed family]] of \u03a3 algebras, the '''direct product''' '''A''' = \u220f<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> '''A'''<sub>''i''</sub> is a \u03a3 algebra defined as follows:\n* The universe set ''A'' of '''A''' is the Cartesian product of the universe sets ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> of '''A'''<sub>''i''</sub>, formally: ''A'' = \u220f<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>;\n* For each ''n'' and each ''n''-ary operation symbol {{nowrap|''f'' \u2208 \u03a3}}, its interpretation ''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup> in '''A''' is defined componentwise, formally: for all {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2208 ''A''}} and each {{nowrap|''i'' \u2208 ''I''}}, the ''i''th component of {{nowrap|''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} is defined as {{nowrap|''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>(''a''<sub>1</sub>(''i''), \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>(''i''))}}.\nFor each {{nowrap|''i'' \u2208 ''I''}}, the ''i''th projection {{nowrap|\u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> : ''A'' \u2192 ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is defined by {{nowrap|1=\u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>(''a'') = ''a''(''i'')}}. It is a [[surjective homomorphism]] between the \u03a3 algebras '''A''' and '''A'''<sub>''i''</sub>.<ref>Stanley N. Burris and H.P. Sankappanavar, 1981. ''[http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html A Course in Universal Algebra.]''  Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3-540-90578-2}}. Here: Def.7.8, p.53 (=p. 67 in pdf file)</ref>\n\nAs a special case, if the index set {{nowrap|1=''I'' = { 1, 2 },}} the direct product of two \u03a3 algebras '''A'''<sub>1</sub> and '''A'''<sub>2</sub> is obtained, written as {{nowrap|1='''A''' = '''A'''<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 '''A'''<sub>2</sub>}}. If \u03a3 just contains one binary operation ''f'', the [[#Group direct product|above]] definition of the direct product of groups is obtained, using the notation {{nowrap|1=''A''<sub>1</sub> = ''G''}}, {{nowrap|1=''A''<sub>2</sub> = ''H''}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>1</sub></sup> = \u2218}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''<sub>2</sub></sup> = \u2219}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>'''A'''</sup> = \u00d7}}. Similarly, the definition of the direct product of modules is subsumed here.\n\n== Categorical product ==\n{{Main|Product (category theory)}}\n\nThe direct product can be abstracted to an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]. In a general category, given a collection of objects ''A<sub>i</sub>'' ''and'' a collection of [[morphism]]s ''p<sub>i</sub>'' from ''A'' to ''A<sub>i</sub>''{{clarify|Is A a single object from A_i, or all A_i?|date=February 2012}} with ''i'' ranging in some index set ''I'', an object ''A'' is said to be a '''categorical product''' in the category if, for any object ''B'' and any collection of morphisms ''f<sub>i</sub>'' from ''B'' to ''A<sub>i</sub>'', there exists a unique morphism ''f'' from ''B'' to ''A'' such that ''f<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>i</sub> f'' and this object ''A'' is unique. This not only works for two factors, but arbitrarily (even infinitely) many.\n\nFor groups we similarly define the direct product of a more general, arbitrary collection of groups ''G<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' in ''I'', ''I'' an index set. Denoting the Cartesian product of the groups by ''G'' we define multiplication on ''G''  with the operation of componentwise multiplication; and corresponding to the ''p<sub>i</sub>'' in the definition above are the projection maps\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\colon G \\to G_i\\quad \\mathrm{by} \\quad \\pi_i(g) = g_i</math>,\n\nthe functions that take <math>(g_j)_{j \\in I}</math> to its ''i''th component ''g<sub>i</sub>''.\n<!-- this is easier to visualize as a [[commutative diagram]]; eventually somebody should insert a relevant diagram for the categorical product here! -->\n\n== Internal and external direct product ==\n<!-- linked from [[Internal direct product]] and [[External direct product]] -->\n{{see also|Internal direct sum}}\n\nSome authors draw a distinction between an '''internal direct product''' and an '''external direct product.''' If <math>A, B \\subset X</math> and <math>A \\times B \\cong X</math>, then we say that ''X'' is an ''internal'' direct product (of ''A'' and ''B''); if ''A'' and ''B'' are not subobjects, then we say that this is an ''external'' direct product.\n\n==Metric and norm==\nA metric on a Cartesian product of metric spaces, and a norm on a direct product of normed vector spaces, can be defined in various ways, see for example [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Direct sum]]\n*[[Cartesian product]]\n*[[Coproduct]]\n*[[Free product]]\n*[[Semidirect product]]\n*[[Zappa\u2013Szep product]]\n*[[Tensor product of graphs]]\n*[[Total order#Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets|Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n*{{Lang Algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Direct Product}}\n[[Category:Abstract algebra]]\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435#\u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f]]", "sha1": "slhcyr3959lwu747cwqe2w6bbfnroir"}}, {"title": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu", "ns": "0", "id": "8888", "revision": {"id": "865394017", "parentid": "865393658", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T17:43:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Girth Summit", "id": "6225634"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2405:205:2418:5914:AA45:8C99:376D:6142|2405:205:2418:5914:AA45:8C99:376D:6142]] ([[User talk:2405:205:2418:5914:AA45:8C99:376D:6142|talk]]) to last revision by 79.75.197.111.

Cleary suggests that ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' in laboratory settings.<ref name=\"Cleary2008\"/>\n\nA 2012 study that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experiences supported this idea.

Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'') involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|work=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M.

Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and d\u00e9j\u00e0  vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|pages=403\u2013424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Dream-based explanation===\nOne theory of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=0-7624-1962-8}}</ref> The spontaneity of these types of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' \"moments\"  can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, to the point where they are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===''Jamais vu''===\n{{Main|Jamais vu }}\n\n''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is a term in psychology which is used to describe any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].\n\nTheoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.<ref name=\"moulin\"/> If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalisation (or [[surreality]]) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.<ref name=\"moulin\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

His place of origin was not [[Thrace]] as the epithet \"Thrax\" denotes, but probably [[Alexandria]] (his father's descent was Thracian). He lived and worked in this city but later taught at [[Rhodes]].\n\nThe first extant grammar of [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Art of Grammar]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} ''T\u00e9khn\u0113 grammatik\u00e9'') is attributed to him but many scholars today doubt that the work really belongs solely to him due to the difference between the technical approach of most of the work and the more literary approach (similar to the 2nd century's Alexandrian tradition) of the first few sections. It concerns itself primarily with a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] description of Greek, lacking any treatment of [[syntax]]. The work was translated into [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] in the early Christian era.\n\nThrax defines grammar at the beginning of the ''T\u00e9khn\u0113'' as \"the practical knowledge of the general usages of poets and [[prose]] writers.\" Thus Dionysius Thrax, like contemporary Alexandrian scholars who edited [[Attic Greek]] and [[Homer]]ic texts, was concerned with facilitating the teaching of classic Greek literature to an audience who spoke [[Koine]] Greek.<ref>There are extensive scholia to the Techne, which have been edited by A.

In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination\u2014but they have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term \"discrimination\" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.<ref>Introduction to sociology. 7th ed.

Print.</ref>  \"Discrimination\" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means \"to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction\".\n\n==Definitions==\nMoral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.<ref>Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, \"Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account\", ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817\u2013856 (2006); Oscar Horta, \"Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion\", ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).</ref> In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression.

It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country the victim lives in, but is instead based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese born in countryside far from city within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.<ref name=\"Accent\">https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\n{{Main|Religious discrimination}}\n\n{{Status of religious freedom}}\n[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|In the 1990s, [[Bhutan]] [[Bhutanese refugees|expelled or forced to leave]] its Hindu population in the name of preserving its Buddhist culture and identity.]]\nReligious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the [[Balkans]], known as the \"rayah\" or the \"protected flock\", was discriminated against under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun\u2013i\u2013Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.<ref>Maan Z.

If so, this can hardly be an illustrative example of religious discrimination and should be replaced with a better example.|date=November 2015}}\n\nRestrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities.

Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied \"the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom\".<ref>U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination.

'''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.\n\nSexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 \u2013 Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group.

In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754609001}}</ref>  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination \u2013 direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot \u2013 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious \u2013 'Bar person wanted \u2013 must look good in a mini skirt'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination|title=Sex Discrimination|website=Citation.co.uk}}</ref> Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.\n\nSocially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J.

While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution.

At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the \"advantaged\" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive \"hawk\" strategy against players of the other, \"disadvantaged\" color, who played the acquiescent \"dove\" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.\n\nThe experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a \"fairness\" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.<ref>{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]\n|author1=Shaun Hargreaves-Heap\n|author2=Yanis Varoufakis\n|title=Some experimental evidence on the evolution of discrimination, co-operation and perceptions of fairness\n|date=July 2002|volume=112\n|issue=481\n|pages=679\u2013703|publisher=[[Royal Economic Society]]|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00735}}</ref>\n\n==State vs. free market==\n\nIt is debated as to whether or not [[market (economics)|markets]] discourage discrimination brought about by the state.

It is argued that microeconomic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects (using explicit treatment of production functions) and that the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.<ref>Richard S.

''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', Volume 1: ''Fundamental Algorithms'', Third Edition. Addison-Wesley, 1997. {{ISBN|0-201-89683-4}}. Section 2.2.1: Stacks, Queues, and Deques, pp. 238&ndash;243.</ref> It is also often called a '''head-tail linked list''', though properly this refers to a specific [[data structure]] ''[[#Implementations|implementation]]'' of a deque (see below).\n\n==Naming conventions==\n''Deque'' is sometimes written ''dequeue'', but this use is generally deprecated in technical literature or technical writing because ''dequeue'' is also a verb meaning \"to remove from a queue\". Nevertheless, several [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and some writers, such as [[Alfred Aho|Aho]], [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]], and [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] in their textbook ''Data Structures and Algorithms'', spell it ''dequeue''. [[John C. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], author of ''Concepts in Programming Languages,'' also uses this terminology.\n\n==Distinctions and sub-types==\nThis differs from the queue abstract data type or ''first in first out'' list ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]), where elements can only be added to one end and removed from the other. This general data class has some possible sub-types:\n\n*An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.\n*An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only.\n\nBoth the basic and most common list types in computing, [[queue (data structure)|queue]]s and [[stack (data structure)|stack]]s can be considered specializations of deques, and can be implemented using deques.\n\n== Operations ==\nThe basic operations on a deque are ''enqueue'' and ''dequeue'' on either end. Also generally implemented are ''[[Peek (data type operation)|peek]]'' operations, which return the value at that end without dequeuing it.\n\nNames vary between languages; major implementations include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! operation !! common name(s) !! [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] !! [[C++]] !! [[Java (programming language)|Java]] !! [[Perl]] !! [[PHP]] !! [[Python (programming language)|Python]] !! [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] !!

These array deques have all the properties of a dynamic array, such as constant-time [[random access]], good [[locality of reference]], and inefficient insertion/removal in the middle, with the addition of amortized constant-time insertion/removal at both ends, instead of just one end. Three common implementations include:\n* Storing deque contents in a [[circular buffer]], and only resizing when the buffer becomes full. This decreases the frequency of resizings.\n* Allocating deque contents from the center of the underlying array, and resizing the underlying array when either end is reached. This approach may require more frequent resizings and waste more space, particularly when elements are only inserted at one end.\n* Storing contents in multiple smaller arrays, allocating additional arrays at the beginning or end as needed. Indexing is implemented by keeping a dynamic array containing pointers to each of the smaller arrays.\n\n===Purely functional implementation===\nDouble-ended queues can also be implemented as a [[purely functional data structure]].<ref name=\"functional\">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf C. Okasaki, \"Purely Functional Data Structures\", September 1996</ref> Two versions of the implementation exist. The first one, called '''real-time deque'', is presented below. It allows the queue to be [[persistent data structure|persistent]] with operations in <math>O(1)</math> worst-case time, but requires [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] lists with [[memoization]]. The second one, with no lazy lists nor memoization is presented at the end of the sections. Its [[amortized analysis|amortized]] time is <math>O(1)</math> if the persistency is not used; but the worst-time complexity of an operation is <math>O(n)</math> where <math>n</math> is the number of elements in the double-ended queue.\n\nLet us recall that, for a list <code>l</code>, <code>|l|</code> denotes its length, that <code>NIL</code> represents an empty list and <code>CONS(h,t)</code> represents the list whose head is <code>h</code> and whose tail is <code>t</code>. The functions <code>drop(i,l)</code> and <code>take(i,l)</code> return the list <code>l</code> without its first <code>i</code> elements, and the <code>i</code>'s first elements respectively. Or, if <code>|l| < i</code>, they return the empty list and <code>l</code> respectively.\n\nA double-ended queue is represented as a sixtuple <code>lenf,f,sf,lenr,r,sr</code> where <code>f</code> is a [[linked list]] which contains the front of the queue of length <code>lenf</code>. Similarly, <code>r</code> is a linked list which represents the reverse of the rear of the queue, of length <code>lenr</code>. Furthermore, it is assured that <code>|f| <= 2|r|+1</code> and <code>|r| <= 2|f|+1</code> - intuitively, it means that neither the front nor the rear contains more than a third of the list plus one element. Finally, <code>sf</code> and <code>sr</code> are tails of <code>f</code> and of <code>r</code>, they allow to schedule the moment where some lazy operations are forced. Note that, when a double-ended queue contains <code>n</code> elements in the front list and <code>n</code> elements in the rear list, then the inequality invariant remains satisfied after <code>i</code> insertions and <code>d</code> deletions when <code>(i+d)/2 <= n</code>. That is, at most <code>n/2</code> operations can happen between each rebalancing.\n\nIntuitively, inserting an element <code>x</code> in front of the double-ended queue <code>lenf, f, sf, lenr, sr</code> leads almost to the double-ended queue <code>lenf+1, CONS(x,f), drop(2,sf), lenr, r, drop(2,sr)</code>, the head and the tail of the double-ended queue <code>lenf, CONS(x,f), sf, lenr, r, sr</code> are <code>x</code> and almost <code>lenf-1, f, drop(2,sf), lenr, r, drop(2,sr)</code> respectively, and the head and the tail of <code>lenf, NIL, NIL, lenr, CONS(x,NIL), drop(2,sr)</code> are <code>x</code> and <code>0, NIL, NIL, 0, NIL, NIL</code> respectively. The function to insert an element in the rear, or to drop the last element of the double-ended queue, are similar to the above function which deal with the front of the double-ended queue. It is said ''almost'' because, after insertion and after an application of ''tail'', the invariant <code>|r| <= 2|f|+1</code> may not be satisfied anymore. In this case it is required to rebalance the double-ended queue.\n\nIn order to avoid an operation with an <code>O(n)</code> costs, the algorithm uses laziness with memoization, and force the rebalancing to be partly done during the following <code>(|l| + |r|)/2</code> operations, that is, before the following rebalancing. In order to create the scheduling, some auxiliary lazy functions are required. The function <code>rotateRev(f,r,a)</code> returns the list <code>f</code>, followed by the list <code>r</code>, and followed by the list <code>a</code>. It is required in this function that <code>|r|-2|f|</code> is 2 or 3. This function is defined by induction as <code>rotateRev(NIL,r,a)=reverse(r++a)</code> where ++ is the concatenation operation, and by <code>rotateRev(CONS(x,f),r,a)=CONS(x,rotateRev(f,drop(2,r),reverse (take(2,r))++a))</code>. It should be noted that, <code>rotateRev(f,r,NIL)</code> returns the list <code>f</code> followed by the list <code>r</code> reversed. The function <code>rotateDrop(f,j,r)</code> which returns <code>f</code> followed by (<code>r</code> without <code>j</code>'s first element) reversed is also required, for <code>j < |f|</code>. It is defined by <code>rotateDrop(f,0,r) == rotateRev(f,r,NIL)</code>, <code>rotateDrop(f,1,r) == rotateRev(f,drop(1,r),NIL)</code> and <code>rotateDrop(CONS(x,f),j,r) == CONS(x,rotateDrop(f,j-2),drop(2,r))</code>.\n\nThe balancing function can now be defined with\n<source lang=\"sml\">\nfun balance(q as (lenf, f,sf, lenr,r,sr))=\n  if lenf > 2*lenr+1 then\n    let val i= (left+lenr)div 2\n        val j=lenf + lenr -i\n        val f'=take(i,f)\n        val r'=rotateDrop(r,i,f)\n    in (i,f',f',j,r',r')\n  else if lenf > 2*lenr+1 then\n    let val j= (left+lenr)div 2\n        val i=lenf + lenr -j\n        val r'=take(i,r)\n        val f'=rotateDrop(f,i,r)\n    in (i,f',f',j,r',r')\n  else q\n</source>\n\nNote that, without the lazy part of the implementation, this would be a non-persistent implementation of queue in <code>O(1)</code> [[amortized analysis|amortized time]]. In this case, the lists <code>sf</code> and <code>sr</code> can be removed from the representation of the double-ended queue.\n\n== Language support ==\n[[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]'s containers provides the generic packages <tt>Ada.Containers.Vectors</tt> and <tt>Ada.Containers.Doubly_Linked_Lists</tt>, for the dynamic array and linked list implementations, respectively.\n\nC++'s [[Standard Template Library]] provides the class templates <tt>std::deque</tt> and <tt>std::list</tt>, for the multiple array and linked list implementations, respectively.\n\nAs of Java 6, Java's Collections Framework provides a new {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Deque}} interface that provides the functionality of insertion and removal at both ends. It is implemented by classes such as {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|ArrayDeque}} (also new in Java 6) and {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|LinkedList}}, providing the dynamic array and linked list implementations, respectively. However, the <tt>ArrayDeque</tt>, contrary to its name, does not support random access.\n\n[[Perl]]'s arrays have native support for both removing ([http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/shift.html shift] and [http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pop.html pop]) and adding ([http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/unshift.html unshift] and [http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/push.html push]) elements on both ends.\n\nPython 2.4 introduced the <code>collections</code> module with support for [https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html#deque-objects deque objects]. It is implemented using a doubly linked list of fixed-length subarrays.\n\nAs of PHP 5.3, PHP's SPL extension contains the 'SplDoublyLinkedList' class that can be used to implement Deque datastructures. Previously to make a Deque structure the array functions array_shift/unshift/pop/push had to be used instead.\n\n[[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20091015073943/http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/containers/Data-Sequence.html Data.Sequence] module implements an efficient, functional deque structure in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. The implementation uses [[2\u20133 tree|2\u20133 finger trees]] annotated with sizes. There are other (fast) possibilities to implement purely functional (thus also [[persistent data structure|persistent]]) double queues (most using heavily [[lazy evaluation]]).<ref name=\"functional\">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf C.

Okasaki simplified the data structure by using lazy evaluation with a bootstrapped data structure and degrading the performance bounds from worst-case to amortized. Kaplan, Okasaki, and Tarjan produced a simpler, non-bootstrapped, amortized version that can be implemented either using lazy evaluation or more efficiently using mutation in a broader but still restricted fashion. Mihaesau and Tarjan created a simpler (but still highly complex) strictly purely functional implementation of catenable deques, and also a much simpler implementation of strictly purely functional non-catenable deques, both of which have optimal worst-case bounds.\n\n== Complexity ==\n* In a doubly-linked list implementation and assuming no allocation/deallocation overhead, the [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of all deque operations is [[Big O notation|O(1)]]. Additionally, the time complexity of insertion or deletion in the middle, given an iterator, is O(1); however, the time complexity of random access by index is O(n).\n* In a growing array, the [[Amortized analysis|amortized]] time complexity of all deque operations is [[Big O notation|O(1)]]. Additionally, the time complexity of random access by index is O(1); but the time complexity of insertion or deletion in the middle is [[Big O notation|O(n)]].\n\n== Applications ==\nOne example where a deque can be used is the ''A-Steal'' [[Scheduling algorithm|job scheduling algorithm]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Eitan Frachtenberg, Uwe Schwiegelshohn | title=Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing: 12th International Workshop, JSSPP 2006\n|publisher=Springer| year=2007| isbn=3-540-71034-5}} See p.22.</ref> This algorithm implements task scheduling for several processors. A separate deque with threads to be executed is maintained for each processor. To execute the next thread, the processor gets the first element from the deque (using the \"remove first element\" deque operation). If the current thread [[Fork (operating system)|forks]], it is put back to the front of the deque (\"insert element at front\") and a new thread is executed. When one of the processors finishes execution of its own threads (i.e. its deque is empty), it can \"steal\" a thread from another processor: it gets the last element from the deque of another processor (\"remove last element\") and executes it. The steal-job scheduling algorithm is used by Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library for parallel programming.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pipeline (Unix)#pipe character|Pipe]]\n*[[Queue (data structure)|Queue]]\n*[[Priority queue]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://ccodearchive.net/info/deque.html Type-safe open source deque implementation at Comprehensive C Archive Network]\n* [http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Deque.html SGI STL Documentation: deque<T, Alloc>]\n* [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/stl/vector_vs_deque.aspx Code Project: An In-Depth Study of the STL Deque Container]\n* [http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/articles/deque.html Deque implementation in C]\n* [http://www.ludvikjerabek.com/downloads.html VBScript implementation of stack, queue, deque, and Red-Black Tree]\n* [https://code.google.com/p/deques/source/browse/ Multiple implementations of non-catenable deques in Haskell]\n\n{{Data structures}}\n\n[[Category:Abstract data types]]", "sha1": "thuel80e4ytgqprc5oxv57ya1ougw99"}}, {"title": "Diene", "ns": "0", "id": "8905", "revision": {"id": "858021903", "parentid": "852478258", "timestamp": "2018-09-04T15:33:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "Edgar181", "id": "491706"}, "comment": "merge from [[Alkadiene]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|organic chemicals|the surname \"Diene\" used in West Africa|Serer people}}\n\n[[File:1,3-butadiene.svg|thumb|150px|[[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]]]]\n\nIn [[organic chemistry]] a '''diene''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|a\u026a|.|i\u02d0|n}} {{respell|DY|een}}) ('''diolefin''' ({{IPAc-en|d|a\u026a|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259|f|\u1d7b|n}} {{respell|dy|OH|l\u0259-fin}}) or '''alkadiene''') is a [[hydrocarbon]] that contains two [[carbon]] [[double bond]]s.  Dienes occur occasionally in nature.  [[Conjugated system|Conjugated]] dienes are widely used as [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] industry.\n\n==Classes==\n\nDienes can be divided into three classes, depending on the relative location of the double bonds: \n#'''Cumulated dienes''' have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called [[allene]]s.\n#'''Conjugated dienes''' have [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds separated by one single bond.\n#'''Unconjugated dienes''' have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. They are usually less stable than [[isomer]]ic conjugated dienes. This can also be known as an isolated diene.\n\n[[Image:Diene.png|thumb|center|650 px|Some dienes: '''A''': 1,2-Propadiene, also known as [[allene]], is the simplest cumulated diene. '''B''': [[Isoprene]], also known as 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, the precursor to natural rubber. '''C''': [[1,3-Butadiene]], a  precursor to synthetic polymers.  '''D''': [[1,5-Cyclooctadiene]], an unconjugated diene (notice that each double bond is two carbons away from the other). '''E''': [[Norbornadiene]], a strained bicyclic and unconjugated  diene.  '''F''': [[Dicyclopentadiene]].  '''G''': [[Linoleic acid]], a fatty acid that is required in the human diet.]]\n\nCompounds that contain more than two double bonds are called [[polyene]]s. Polyenes and dienes share many of their properties.\n\n==Synthesis of dienes==\n\nOn an industrial scale, butadiene is prepared by [[thermal cracking]] of [[butane]]s. In a similarly non-selective process, [[dicyclopentadiene]] is obtained from [[coal tar]]s.\n\nIn the laboratory, more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as [[dehydrohalogenation]]s and [[Condensation (chemistry)|condensations]].  Myriad [[organic reaction|methods]] have been developed, such as the [[Whiting reaction]].  Families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the [[oligomerization]] and [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] of conjugated dienes.  For example, 1,5-cyclooctadiene and vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of [[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]].\n\nDiene-containing [[fatty acid]]s are [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[acetyl CoA]].\n\n\u03b1,\u03c9-Dienes have the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>(CH=CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.  They are prepared industrially by [[ethenolysis]] of cyclic dienes.  For example, [[1,5-Hexadiene|1,5-hexadiene]] and 1,9-decadiene, useful crosslinking agents and synthetic intermediates, are produced from [[1,5-Cyclooctadiene|1,5-cyclooctadiene]] and [[cyclooctene]], respectively.

[[Chloroprene]] is related but it is a synthetic monomer.\n\n===Cycloadditions===\nAn important reaction for conjugated dienes is the [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]].  Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of [[natural product]]s (e.g., [[Danishefsky's diene]]).\n\n===Other addition reactions===\nConjugated dienes add reagents such as [[bromine]] and [[hydrogen]] by both 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition pathways.  Addition of polar reagents can generate complex architectures:<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Roger Bishop | collvol = 9 | collvolpages = 692 | prep = CV9P0692\n| title =9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione}}{{cite journal | title =2,6-Dichloro-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane: Multigram Display of Azide and Cyanide Components on a Versatile Scaffold | first4 = M.

These reactions require a metal [[catalyst]]:\n::[[File:RCM cyclophane example.png|520px]]\n\n===Acidity===\nThe position adjacent to a double bond is [[acidic]] because the resulting [[allyl]] anion is stabilized by resonance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more alkenes are involved to create greater stability. For example, deprotonation at position 3 of a 1,4-diene or position 5 of a 1,3-diene give a [[pentadienyl]] anion. An even greater effect is seen if the anion is aromatic, for example, deprotonation of [[cyclopentadiene]] to give the [[cyclopentadienyl]] anion.<!-- TODO: chart of pKa for methylene in alkane, singly and doubly allylic, and Cp -->\n\n[[File:HayashiChiralNBD.svg|thumb|left|122px|[[C2-Symmetric ligands|C<sub>2</sub>-symmetric]] diene ligand used in [[asymmetric catalysis]].<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Hayashi, T.; Ueyama, K.; Tokunaga, N.; Yoshida, K.|title=A Chiral Chelating Diene as a New Type of Chiral Ligand for Transition Metal Catalysts: Its Preparation and Use for the Rhodium-Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,4-Addition|journal=J.

L, ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Tatian''</ref> Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four [[gospel]]s\u2014[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]\u2014into a single coherent narrative of Jesus's life and death.  However, and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists, Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts; or to demonstrate that, as they stood, they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error.\n\nTatian's harmony follows the gospels closely in terms of text but, in order to fit all the canonical material in, he created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]] sequence and John's sequence; and occasionally creates intervening time periods that are found in none of the source accounts.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFall, Leslie; \"Tatian's Diatessaron: Mischievous or Misleading?\"; Westminster Theological Journal, 56, 87-114; 1994</ref> This sequence is coherent and consistent within itself, but not necessarily consistent with that in all or any of the separate canonical gospels; and Tatian apparently applies the same principle in respect of the narrative itself. Where the gospels differ from one another in respect of the details of an event or teaching; the Diatessaron resolves such apparent contradictions by selecting one or another alternative wording and adding consistent details from the other gospels; while omitting apparent duplicate matter, especially across the [[synoptic gospels|synoptics]]. Hence, in respect of [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the healing of the blind at Jericho]] the Diatessaron reports only one blind man, Bartimeaus, healed by Jesus when leaving the city according to the account in Mark 10:46ff (expanded with phrases from Luke 18:36-37); consequently omitting any separate mention of two unnamed blind men healed by Jesus leaving Jericho (Matthew 20:29ff), and also the healing by Jesus entering Jericho the previous day of a single unnamed blind man (Luke 18:35ff).<ref>Moore, G.F.; \"Tatian's Diatessaron and the analysis of the Pentateuch\"; Journal of Bilical Literature,9:2, 201-215; 1890</ref>\n\nOtherwise, Tatian originally omitted altogether both of the different [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies]] in Matthew and Luke, as well as Luke's introduction (Luke 1: 1-4);<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  and also did not originally include [[Pericope adulterae|Jesus' encounter with the adulteress]] (John 7:53\u20138:11). This latter passage is, however, generally considered to be a late addition to the Gospel of John,<ref>\"certainly not part of the original text,\" according to Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Pericope adulterae''.</ref> with the Diatessaron itself often cited as an early textual witness in support of its omission.  Most scholars agree that Tatian did, from the beginning, include the longer ending of Mark (Mark 16: 9-20), and correspondingly is amongst the earliest witnesses to this inclusion. Tatian added no significant wording to the textual material he took from the separate gospels.<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 9, Introduction to Diatessaron.</ref> Only 56 verses in the canonical Gospels do not have a counterpart in the Diatessaron, mostly the genealogies and the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''. The final work is about 72% the length of the four gospels put together; around a quarter of the text of the separate gospels being adjudged by Tatian to be duplicated.  (McFall, 1994).\n\nIn the [[History of the Catholic Church|early Church]], the gospels at first circulated independently, with Matthew the most popular. The Diatessaron is notable evidence for the authority already enjoyed by the gospels by the mid- to late-2nd century.<ref name =\"Oxford:Diatessaron\">Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Diatessaron''</ref> Within twenty years after Tatian's harmony was written, [[Irenaeus]] was expressly arguing for the authoritative character of the Four Gospels. It is unclear whether Tatian intended the Diatessaron to supplement or replace the four separate gospels; but both outcomes came to pass in different churches. The Diatessaron became adopted as the standard [[lectionary]] text of the gospels in some Syriac-speaking churches from the late 2nd to the 5th century, when it gave way to the four separate Gospels,<ref name =\"Oxford:Diatessaron\" /> in the [[Peshitta]] version.<ref>Cross, F. L, ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Peshitta''</ref>  At the same time, in the churches of the Latin west, the Diatessaron circulated as a supplement to the four gospels, especially in the Latin translation.\n\n== Tatian's harmony ==\n[[File:Saint Justin Martyr by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|alt=|thumb|Tatian was a pupil of 2nd-century Christian convert, apologist, and philosopher [[Justin Martyr]]]]\n[[Tatian]] was an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] who was a pupil of [[Justin Martyr]] in [[Rome]], where, Justin says, the ''apomnemoneumata'' (recollections or memoirs) of the Apostles, the gospels, were read every Sunday. When Justin quotes the synoptic Gospels, he tends to do so in a harmonised form, and Helmut Koester and others conclude that Justin must have possessed a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Gospel harmony|harmony]] text of Matthew, Luke and Mark.\n\nIf so, it is unclear how much Tatian may have borrowed from this previous author in determining his own narrative sequence of Gospel elements. It is equally unclear whether Tatian took the Syriac Gospel texts composited into his Diatessaron from a previous translation, or whether the translation was his own. Where the Diatessaron records Gospel quotations from the Jewish Scriptures, the text appears to agree with that found in the Syriac [[Peshitta]] Old Testament rather than that found in the Greek [[Septuagint]]\u2014as used by the original Gospel authors. The majority consensus is that the Peshitta Old Testament preceded the Diatessaron, and represents an independent translation from the Hebrew Bible. Resolution of these scholarly questions remained very difficult so long as no complete version of the ''Diatessaron'' in Syriac or Greek had been recovered; while the medieval translations that had survived\u2014in [[Arabic]] and [[Latin]]\u2014both relied on texts that had been heavily corrected to conform better with later canonical versions of the separate Gospel texts.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\">W. B. Lockwood, Vernacular Scriptures in Germany and the Low Countries before 1500,  in The Cambridge History of the Bible, ed. G.W.H. Lampe,Cambridge University Press, 1969, p. 429.</ref>\n\nThere is scholarly uncertainty about what language Tatian used for its original composition, whether [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/>  Modern scholarship tends to favour a Syriac origin; but even so, the exercise must have been repeated in Greek very shortly afterwards\u2014probably by Tatian himself.\n\n== Diatessaron in Syriac Christianity ==\n\nThe ''Diatessaron'' was used as the standard Gospel text in the liturgy of at least some sections of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian Church]] for possibly up to two centuries and was quoted or alluded to by Syrian writers. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] wrote a commentary on it, the Syriac original of which was rediscovered only in 1957, when a manuscript acquired by Sir [[Chester Beatty]] in 1957 (now Chester Beatty Syriac MS 709, Dublin) turned out to contain the text of Ephrem's commentary.  The manuscript constituted approximately half of the leaves of a volume of Syriac writings that had been catalogued in 1952 in the library of the Coptic monastery of Deir es-Suriani in [[Wadi Natrun]], Egypt. Subsequently, the Chester Beatty library was able to track down and buy a further 42 leaves, so that now approximately eighty per cent of the Syriac commentary is available (McCarthy 1994). Ephrem did not comment on all passages in the Diatessaron, and nor does he always quote commentated passages in full; but for those phrases that he does quote, the commentary provides for the first time a dependable witness to Tatian's original; and also confirms its content and their sequence. [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-10/anf10-06.htm].\n\nHow the Gospel text that was a standard in Syriac Christianity for possibly as long as two centuries should have utterly disappeared requires explaining. [[Theodoret]], bishop of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus on the Euphrates]] in [[Syria (region)|upper Syria]] in 423, suspecting Tatian of having been a heretic, sought out and found more than two hundred copies of the ''Diatessaron'', which he \"collected and put away, and introduced instead of them the Gospels of the four evangelists\". Thus the harmonisation was replaced in the 5th century by the canonical four gospels individually, in the [[Peshitta]] version, whose Syriac text nevertheless contains many Diatessaronic readings. Gradually, without extant copies to which to refer, the Diatessaron developed a reputation for having been [[Christian heresy|heretical]].\n\n== Vernacular harmonies derived from the Diatessaron ==\n\nNo Christian tradition, other than some Syriac ones, has ever adopted a harmonized Gospel text for use in its liturgy. However, in many traditions, it was not unusual for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the [[vernacular]] of their own day. Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian's Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century [[Persian Language|Persian]] harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian's sequence exactly, but uses a source text corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac [[Peshitta]] Gospels; the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem's commentary.\n\nA [[Vetus Latina]] version of Tatian's Syriac text appears to have circulated in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely to that of the canonical [[Gospel of Luke]]; and also including additional canonical text (such as the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]''), as well, possibly, as non-canonical matter from the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]. With the gradual adoption of the [[Vulgate]] as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings.<ref name=\"B. Lockwood 1500, p. 429\"/> In 546 [[Victor of Capua]] discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the [[Codex Fuldensis]], survives in the monastic library at [[Fulda]], where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in [[Old High German]], Eastern Frankish and [[Old Saxon]] (the alliterative poem '[[Heliand]]'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th\u201314th century Gospel harmonies in [[Middle Dutch]], [[Middle High German]], [[Middle French]], [[Middle English]], [[Italian Language|Tuscan]] and [[Italian Language|Venetian]]; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The [[Li\u00e8ge Diatessaron]] is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced [[Gospel of Barnabas]] (Joosten, 2002).\n\n== Names for the Gospel harmony ==\n\nThe title ''Diatessaron'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diatessar\u014dn'' (\"made of four [ingredients]\"), derived in turn from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd (''dia tessar\u014dn'') (\"out of four\"; i.e., ''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac]], dia'', \"at intervals of\" and ''tessar\u014dn'' [genitive of [[wikt:\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2|\u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2]], ''tessares''], \"four\").\n\nThe Syriac name for this gospel harmony is '{{lang|syc|\u0710\u0718\u0722\u0713\u0720\u071d\u0718\u0722 \u0715\u0721\u071a\u0720\u071b\u0710}}' (Ewangeliy\u00f4n Damhallt\u00ea) meaning 'Gospel of the Mixed' while in the other hand we have '{{lang|syc|\u0710\u0718\u0722\u0713\u0720\u071d\u0718\u0722 \u0715\u0721\u0726\u072a\u072b\u0710}}' (Evangelion de Mepharreshe) meaning 'Gospel of the separated'.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible|Eastern Christianity}}\n* [[Gospel harmony]]\n* [[Papyrus 25]]\n* [[Dura Parchment 24]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* [[Jan Joosten (biblical scholar)|Jan Joosten]], (2001). \"Tatian's Diatessaron and the Old Testament Peshitta\", Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 120, No. 3 (Autumn, 2001), pp.&nbsp;501\u2013523\n* Jan Joosten, (2002). \"The Gospel of Barnabas and the Diatessaron\", Harvard Theological Review 95.1 (2002): pp 73\u201396.\n*Carmel McCarthy, (1994).

[i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children.. . and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'\"<ref name=Advocates/> This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, ''The Dean Koontz Companion'', he recalled that he:\n\n<blockquote>\nrealized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.\"<ref name=Advocates/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nIn his spare time, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Star Quest]]'', which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen [[science-fiction]] novels. Seeing the [[Catholic faith]] as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its \"intellectual rigor\" and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.<ref name=Drake_2007>{{cite news|accessdate=2009-11-28 |last=Drake |first=Tim |title=Chatting With Koontz About Faith |work=[[National Catholic Register]] |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |date=March 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117060951/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |df= }}</ref><ref>Rossi, Tony, [http://catholicexchange.com/2009/08/01/120925/ Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels] Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009</ref> He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert [[G.K.

Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several [[copy editing|editor]]s convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different [[genre]]s invariably fell victim to \"negative crossover\" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the \"Mike Tucker\" trilogy [''Blood Risk'', ''Surrounded'', ''Wall of Masks''] in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of [[Richard Stark]] ([[Donald E. Westlake]]). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared - ''Demon Seed'' and ''Invasion'' were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and ''Prison of Ice'' had certain sections [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]].\n\nAfter writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was ''[[Whispers (novel)|Whispers]]'', published in 1980. The two books before that, ''[[The Key to Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse (novel)|The Funhouse]]'', also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was ''[[Demon Seed (novel)|Demon Seed]]'', the sales of which picked up after the release of the [[Demon Seed|film of the same name]] in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=demon seed from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/demon-seed-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.co|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book ''[[Strangers (Dean Koontz novel)|Strangers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=strangers from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/strangers-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>\nSince then, 12 hardcovers and 13 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].<ref name=\"deankoontz.com\"/>\n\nBestselling science-fiction writer [[Brian Herbert]] has stated, \"I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.frankherbert.net |title=Interview with Brian Herbert |url=http://www.frankherbert.net/news/BrianHerbertInterview.pdf/ |accessdate=2011-05-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, [[psychologist]] [[Katherine Ramsland]] published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him.

Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The [[royalties]] of the books were donated to CCI.<ref name=\"trixie\"/> In 2007, Trixie contracted terminal [[cancer]] that created a [[tumor]] in her heart.

Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a [[wavelength]] of 21&nbsp;cm (1,420.4&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]]). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral [[hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the [[radio spectrum]].\n\nTwo months later, Harvard University astronomy professor [[Harlow Shapley]] speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying \"The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it.

Using the 25&nbsp;m dish of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: [[Epsilon Eridani]] and [[Tau Ceti]]. In this project, which he called [[Project Ozma]], he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21&nbsp;cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960.<ref name=\"history\"/> The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It detected no signals.\n\nSoon thereafter, Drake hosted a \"[[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]\" meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.<ref name=\"Astrobiology Magazine\">{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/the-drake-equation-revisited-part-i/ | title=The Drake Equation Revisited: Part I | work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] | date=Sep 29, 2003 | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote> As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda.

After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question.<ref name=\"Burchell\"/> It also formed the backbone of [[astrobiology]] as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21&nbsp;cm [[Hydrogen frequencies|hydrogen frequency]].

For example, [[David Brin]] states: \"The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society\".<ref name=\"GS\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Brin |first=G. D.\n |year=1983\n |title=The Great Silence \u2013 The Controversy Concerning Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life\n |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]\n |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=283\u2013309\n |bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..283B\n}}</ref>  Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.\n\n;Colonization : It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other [[star system]]s. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity {{mvar|v}}, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime {{mvar|L}}.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.<ref name=\"GS\"/>\n\n;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be {{math|1 + ''n''<sub>r</sub>}}, which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.\n\n:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then {{math|''n''<sub>r</sub>}} may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}}, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.\n\n;METI factor : [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Zaitsev |first=A.\n |date=May 2005\n |title=The Drake Equation: Adding a METI Factor\n |url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/Drake_equation.html\n |publisher=[[SETI League]]\n |accessdate=2013-04-20\n}}</ref> He defined the factor as \"the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness\", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.\n\n:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.\n\n;Biogenic gases : Astronomer [[Sara Seager]] proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases.<ref name=\"NYT-20161207\">{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Chris |title=\u2018The World Sees Me as the One Who Will Find Another Earth\u2019 - The star-crossed life of Sara Seager, an astrophysicist obsessed with discovering distant planets. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/the-world-sees-me-as-the-one-who-will-find-another-earth.html |date=December 7, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 8, 2016 }}</ref> These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.<ref name=equation>[http://www.space.com/22648-drake-equation-alien-life-seager.html?cid=51463011558824 The Drake Equation Revisited: Interview with Planet Hunter Sara Seager] Devin Powell, ''Astrobiology Magazine''  4 September 2013.</ref>\n\n:The Seager equation looks like this:<ref name=equation />{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The rendering of the equation here is slightly modified for clarity of presentation from the rendering in the cited source.<ref name=equation />}}\n::<math display=block>N = N_* \\cdot F_\\mathrm{Q} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{HZ} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{O} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{L} \\cdot F_\\mathrm{S}</math>\n:where:\n\n::{{math|''N''}} = the number of planets with detectable signs of life\n::{{math|''N''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} = the number of stars observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>Q</sub>}} = the fraction of stars that are quiet\n::{{math|''F''<sub>HZ</sub>}} = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone\n::{{math|''F''<sub>O</sub>}} = the fraction of those planets that can be observed\n::{{math|''F''<sub>L</sub>}} = the fraction that have life\n::{{math|''F''<sub>S</sub>}} = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas\n\nSeager stresses, \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,\u201d explaining, \u201cSince Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets.

However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for {{math|''f''<sub>l</sub>}} close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.\n\nCountering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth \u2014 that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth.

Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable.

Some scenarios such as the [[snowball Earth]] or research into the [[extinction events]] have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile.

It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in {{math|''L''}}, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.\n\n[[David Grinspoon]] has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival.

This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ''ever'' develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than {{val|2.5|e=-24}}. Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than {{val|1.7|e=-11}} (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://phys.org/news/2016-04-limits-uniqueness.html |title= Are we alone?

Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.  The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Dvorsky |first=G.\n |date=31 May 2007\n |title=The Drake Equation is obsolete\n |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2007/05/drake-equation-is-obsolete.html\n |work=Sentient Developments\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref>\n\nOne reply to such criticisms<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Tarter |first=J.\n |date=May\u2013June 2006\n |title=The Cosmic Haystack Is Large\n |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/cosmic_haystack_is_large/\n |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]\n |volume=30 |issue=3\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref> is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics.

The most common suspect is {{math|''f''<sub>i</sub>}}, but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that {{math|''n''<sub>e</sub>}} is the small term.\n*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning {{math|''f''<sub>c</sub>}} is small.  Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.\n*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of {{mvar|L}} is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#Periodic extinction by natural events|they tend to be destroyed by natural events]], and others.\n\nThese lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hanson |first=R.\n |date=15 September 1998\n |title=The Great Filter \u2014 Are We Almost Past It?\n |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html\n |accessdate=2013-08-21\n}}</ref> which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.\n\n==In fiction and popular culture==\nThe equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on ''[[Star Trek]]'', the television series he created.

The [[Barada|Barada River]] flows through Damascus.\n\nFirst settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] from 661 to 750. After the victory of the [[Abbasid dynasty]], the seat of Islamic power was moved to [[Baghdad]].

The Anti-Lebanon mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000&nbsp;ft. and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the [[Ghouta]], irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada river emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake, because in years of severe drought it does not even exist.<ref name=\"romeartlover\"/>\n\nThe modern city has an area of {{convert|105|km2|abbr=on}}, out of which {{convert|77|km2|abbr=on}} is urban, while [[Jabal Qasioun]] occupies the rest.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Damascus Metropolitan Area Urban Planning and Development |url=http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang=en |title=DMA-UPD Discussion Paper Series No.2 |date=October 2009 |page=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028075616/http://dma-upd.org/PublicFiles/File/Discussion%20Papers/02_Strategy%20and%20Frameworks%20for%20the%20Damascus%20City%20Urbanization%20to%20Guide%20the%20City%20Master%20Plan%20Revision_R1.pdf?lang=en |archivedate=2012-10-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Barada river in Damascus (April 2009).jpg|thumb|upright|One of the rare periods the [[Barada]] river is high, seen here next to the [[Four Seasons Hotel Damascus|Four Seasons]] hotel in downtown Damascus]]\nThe old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river [[Barada]] which is almost dry ({{convert|3|cm|0|abbr=on}} left). To the south-east, north and north-east it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: [[Midan]] in the south-west, [[Sarouja]] and Imara in the north and north-west. These neighbourhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of [[Jabal Qasioun]], overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighbourhood centred on the important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]]. These new neighbourhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the European regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as ''al-Akrad'' ''(the Kurds)'' and ''al-Muhajirin'' ''(the migrants)''. They lay {{convert|2|-|3|km|abbr=on|0}} north of the old city.\n\nFrom the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial centre began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centred on the area known as ''[[Marjeh Square|al-Marjeh]]'' or ''the meadow''. ''Al-Marjeh'' soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall on it. The courts of justice, post office and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanised residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between [[Marjeh Square|al-Marjeh]] and [[al-Salihiyah]]. The commercial and administrative centre of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.\n\n[[File:Districts of damascus english.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[Municipalities of Damascus]]]]In the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1956\u20131957 the new neighbourhood of [[Yarmouk (camp)|Yarmouk]] became a second home to thousands of Palestinian refugees.<ref>The palestinian refugees in Syria. Their past, present and future. Dr. Hamad Said al-Mawed, 1999</ref> City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western [[Mezzeh]] neighbourhood and most recently along the Barada valley in [[Dummar]] in the north west and on the slopes of the mountains at Berze in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.\n\nDamascus used to be surrounded by an [[oasis]], the [[Ghouta]] region (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0637\u0629 ''al-\u0121\u016b\u1e6d\u00e4''), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water and various sources to the west are tapped by water contractors. The flow of the Barada has reduced with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. The lower aquifers are polluted by city's runoff from heavily used roads, industry and sewage.\n\n===Climate===\nDamascus has a [[cold desert climate]] (''BWk'') in [[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger system]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms were formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these kingdoms was [[Aram-Damascus]], centered on its capital Damascus.<ref name=\"Burns9\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=9}}</ref> The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle, adopted the name \"Dimashqu\" for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still-undeveloped and sparsely populated area,<ref name=\"Burns10\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=10}}</ref> they established the water distribution system of Damascus by constructing canals and tunnels which maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The same network was later improved by the Romans and the Umayyads, and still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city today.<ref name=\"Burns13\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as [[Zobah|Aram-Zobah]], based in the [[Beqaa Valley]].<ref name=\"Burns10\" />\n\nThe city would gain pre-eminence in southern Syria when [[Rezon the Syrian|Ezron]], the claimant to Aram-Zobah's throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. Ezron overthrew the city's tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this new state expanded south, it prevented the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east.<ref name=\"Burns10\" /> Under Ezron's grandson, [[Ben-Hadad I]] (880\u2013841 BC), and his successor [[Hazael]], Damascus annexed [[Bashan]] (modern-day [[Hauran]] region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC when [[Ben-Hadad II]] was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging [[Sebastia, Nablus|Samaria]]. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.<ref name=\"Burns11\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=11}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] which was attempting to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King [[Hadadezer]] of Damascus led a [[Levant]]ine coalition, that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by [[King Ahab]] of Israel, in the [[Battle of Qarqar]] against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus came out victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. However, after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus attempted to invade Israel, but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa'a valleys.<ref name=\"Burns11\" />\n\nBy the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a dark age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural centre of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city, but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria led by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became totally subjugated by their rule. A positive effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with [[Arabia]]. However, Assyrian authority was dwindling by 609\u2013605 BC, and Syria-Palestine was falling into the orbit of Pharaoh [[Necho II]]'s Egypt. In 572 BC, all of Syria had been conquered by the [[Neo-Babylonian]]s, but the status of Damascus under [[Babylon]] is relatively unknown.<ref name=\"Burns2123\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=21\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman period===\n[[File:The Jupiter temple in Damascus.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus|Jupiter Temple]] at the entrance of [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]]]]\n\nDamascus was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Damascus became the site of a struggle between the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] empires. The control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. [[Seleucus I Nicator]], one of Alexander's generals, made [[Antioch]] the capital of his vast empire, which led to the decline of Damascus' importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as [[Latakia]] in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek [[hippodamian]] system and renamed it \"Demetrias\".<ref>Cohen raises doubts about this claim in {{Citation | author1=Cohen, Getzel M | author2=EBSCOhost | title=The Hellenistic settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa | publication-date=2006 | publisher=University of California Press | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32915052 | accessdate=26 May 2014 }} page 137 note 4 - suggeasting the ''received tradition'' of the renaming rests on a few writers following Mionnets writings in 1811</ref>\n\n[[File:Bab Sharqi Street, Damascus.jpg|left|thumb|The Biblical [[Street called Straight]] of Damascus]]\nIn 64 BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] general [[Pompey]] annexed the western part of Syria.

Still today the Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the ''Via Recta'') and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate which still survives at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus.

During the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', Damascus and the Roman province of Syria in general began to prosper. Damascus's importance as a [[caravan city]] was evident with the trade routes from southern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Palmyra]], [[Petra]], and the silk routes from China all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. Circa 125 CE the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] promoted the city of Damascus to \"Metropolis of [[Coele-Syria]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Butcher|first=Kevin|title=Coinage in Roman Syria: Northern Syria, 64 BC-AD 253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FlmAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Royal Numismatic Society|isbn=978-0-901405-58-6|page=220}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Barclay Vincent Head|title=Historia Numorum: A Manual of Greek Numismatics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_oFBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA662|year=1887|page=662|chapter=VII.

The Roman architects brought together the Greek and Aramaean foundations of the city and fused them into a new layout measuring approximately {{convert|1500|by|750|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}, surrounded by a city wall. The city wall contained seven gates, but only the eastern gate (Bab Sharqi) remains from the Roman period. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters (16.4&nbsp;ft) below the modern city.\n\nThe old borough of [[Bab Tuma]] was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] community.

With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by [[Baghdad]], the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus ostracised, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterwards, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It roughly disappeared from written records for the next century and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.<ref name=\"Burns132\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=130\u2013132}}</ref>\n\n[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], a dissenting Turkish governor appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878-79. In an act of respect for the previous Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu'awiya's grave in the city. [[Tulunid]] rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the [[Qarmatians]] who were adherents of [[Shia Islam]]. Due to their inability to control the vast amount of land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the [[Ikhshidid]]s, took control of the city. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab [[Hamdanid]] dynasty of [[Aleppo]] and the [[Baghdad]]-based Abbasids until 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the [[Fatimid]]s in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.<ref name=\"Burns135\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Califate 750.jpg|thumb|Damascus the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, which extended from Portugal to India]]\n\nThe Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the Sunni Arabs of the city who frequently revolted. A Turk, [[Alptakin]] drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines from attempting to annex the city. However, by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph [[al-Aziz]], wrested back control of the city and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer, [[al-Muqaddasi]], visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city was \"magnificent\", but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] (996\u20131021). In 998, hundreds of Damascus' citizens were rounded up and executed by him for incitement. Three years after al-Hakim's mysterious disappearance, the Arab tribes of southern Syria formed an alliance to stage a massive rebellion against the Fatimids, but they were crushed by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari|Anushtakin al-Duzbari]], in 1029. This victory gave the latter mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords, but gaining the admiration of Damascus' citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to [[Aleppo]] where he died in 1041.<ref name=\"Burns138\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}</ref> From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city's history.

It was ruled by [[Tutush I|Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I]] starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son [[Duqaq|Abu Nasr Duqaq]] in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (''[[madrasa]]s'') and hospitals (''maristans''). Damascus soon became one of the most important centres of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq's death in 1104, his mentor (''[[atabeg]]''), [[Toghtekin]], took control of Damascus and the [[Burid Dynasty|Burid line]] of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the [[moral authority]] of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.<ref name=\"Burns142\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=142}}</ref>\n\nWhile the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and [[Diyarbakir]], the Crusaders, who arrived in the [[Levant]] in 1097, conquered [[Jerusalem]], [[Mount Lebanon]] and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included [[Homs]], the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights a part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din [[Mawdud]] of [[Mosul]], Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110.<ref name=\"Burns147\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=147}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Tughtakin's death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Din Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of [[Mosul]], [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Imad al-Din Zengi]], took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 [[Isma'ili|Isma'ili Muslims]] were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at [[Banias]], to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 60,000 troops. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city.<ref name=\"Burns148-9\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|pp=148\u2013149}}</ref> Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he himself was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. [[Mu'in al-Din Unur]], his ''[[mamluk]]'' (\"slave soldier\") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi\u2014with Safwat al-Mulk's backing\u2014to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.<ref name=\"Burns151\">{{Harvnb|Burns|2005|p=151}}</ref>\n\nIn 1144 Zengi [[Siege of Edessa|conquered Edessa]], a crusader stronghold, which led to [[Second Crusade|a new crusade]] from Europe in 1148. In the meantime Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|Their siege]], however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last= Phillips|title=The Second Crusade: Extending the Frontiers of Christendom |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year= 2007|pages= 216\u2013227}}</ref>\n\nIn 1164, King [[Amalric of Jerusalem]] [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|invaded Fatimid Egypt]], which requested help from Nur ad-Din.

The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the [[Treaty of Jaffa]] in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the crusaders to fulfil their vows, after which they all returned home.

The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including [[Ibn Khaldun]], who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal he put the city to sack. The [[Umayyad Mosque]] was burnt and men and women taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at [[Samarkand]]. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name ''burj al-ru'us'', originally \"the tower of heads\".\n\nRebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.\n\n===Ottoman period===\n{{see also|Damascus Eyalet|Syria Vilayet}}\n[[File:Takiyya as-S\u00fcleimaniyya Mosque 02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tekkiye Mosque]]]]\nIn early 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian [[Safavids]], started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the [[khutba]] in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of [[Selim I]]. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, [[Khanqah|tekkiye]] and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh [[Ibn Arabi|Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi]] in [[al-Salihiyah]]. This was to be the first of Damascus' great Ottoman monuments.\nDuring this time, according to an Ottoman census, Damascus had 10,423 households.<ref>\"Population and Revenue in the Towns of Palestine in the Sixteenth Century\"</ref>\n\nThe Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great [[Hajj]] caravans to [[Mecca]], Damascus was treated with more attention by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] than its size might have warranted\u2014for most of this period, [[Aleppo]] was more populous and commercially more important. In 1560 the [[Tekkiye Mosque|Tekkiye al-Sulaimaniyah]], a mosque and [[caravanserai|khan]] for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]], and soon afterwards a [[Al-Salimiyah Madrasa|madrasa]] was built adjoining it.\n\nUnder [[Ottoman rule]], Christians and [[Jews]] were considered [[dhimmi]]s and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840 the false accusation of [[ritual murder]] was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. In addition the [[1860 Druze-Christian conflict in Lebanon|massacre of Christians in 1860]] was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries, when fighting between [[Druze]] and [[Maronites]] in [[Mount Lebanon]] spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the citadel. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory [[Midan]] district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbours.\n\nAmerican Missionary E.C. Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was 'about' 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews and 100,000 'Mohammedans' with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians.<ref>Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches \u2013 notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'.

The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by [[Jamal Pasha]], governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the [[Arab Revolt]] and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.\n\n[[File:Emir Faisal; Lt.

Political tension rose in November 1917, when the new [[Bolshevik]] government in Russia revealed the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab east between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the \"complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.\" The [[Syrian National Congress]] in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the [[Versailles Conference]] had granted France a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General [[Mariano Goybet]] crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus capital of their [[League of Nations]] [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|Mandate for Syria]].\n[[File:Damascus Opera House.jpg|thumb|The [[Damascus Opera House]], opened in 2004]]\nWhen in 1925 the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] in the [[Hauran]] spread to Damascus, the French suppressed with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]] and [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as ''[[al-Hariqa]]'' (\"the fire\"). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels infiltrating from the [[Ghouta]], and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars.\n\nOn 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]], [[Battle of Damascus (1941)|Damascus was captured]] from the [[Vichy French]] forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force.

The ''[[Damascus Straight Street]]'' (referred to in the account of the [[Conversion of Saint Paul|conversion]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:11), also known as the ''[[Via Recta]]'', was the [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] (East-West main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}. Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The [[Bab Sharqi]] street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of [[Bab Tuma]] (St. Thomas's Gate). [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] is also a main market in Damascus and was named after [[Midhat Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the [[House of Saint Ananias|House of Ananias]], an underground chapel that was the cellar of [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]]'s house. The [[Umayyad Mosque]], also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of [[St. John the Baptist]]. The [[Mausoleum of Saladin|mausoleum]] where [[Saladin]] was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque]], the shrine of the youngest daughter of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of [[Amara District|Amara]] is also within a walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is [[Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque]], where the tomb of [[Zaynab bint Ali]] is located.\n\nShias, Fatemids and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad Caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain's head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. All other remaining members of Imam Husain's family (left alive after Karbala) along with heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near [[Bab al-Saghir]]), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called \"Raous-us-sohda-e-karbala\", visited by all Shias. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where [[Ali ibn Husayn|Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin]] used to pray while in captivity.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Harat Al Yehud<ref>http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Jewish-Quarter-of-Damascus-blooms-again</ref> or Jewish Quarter is a recently restored historical tourist destination popular among Europeans before the outbreak of civil war.

Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the Airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.\nStreets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles.\n\nPublic transport in Damascus depends extensively on [[minibuses]]. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two end points and possibly an important station along the line and [[Taxicab]].\n\nServed by [[Chemins de Fer Syriens]], the former main railway station of Damascus was [[Hejaz Railway|al-Hejaz railway station]], about {{convert|1|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} west of the old city.

Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as [[international law]] in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations. The concept and custom of diplomatic immunity dates back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be [[customary law]]. Diplomatic immunity was developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and [[War|armed conflict]]. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.\n\nOriginally, these privileges and immunities were granted on a [[bilateralism|bilateral]], [[ad hoc]] basis, which led to misunderstandings and conflict, pressure on weaker states, and an inability for other states to judge which party was at fault. An international agreement known as the Vienna Convention codified the rules and agreements, providing standards and privileges to all states.\n\nIt is possible for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious [[crime]], unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, say, allegations of [[espionage|spying]]), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (except perhaps in cases of [[defection]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}). Alternatively, the home country may prosecute the individual.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} If immunity is waived by a government so that a diplomat (or their family members) can be prosecuted, it must be because there is a case to answer and it is in the public interest to prosecute them. For instance, in 2002, a Colombian diplomat in London was prosecuted for manslaughter, once diplomatic immunity was waived by the Colombian government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2284320.stm |title=An example where diplomatic immunity was waived in the public interest |publisher=BBC News |date=27 September 2002 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2133055.stm |title=Representations on behalf of the victim's family led to the prosecution of a military attache for manslaughter |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2002 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section |date=February 2014}}\n\n===Ancient===\n[[File:Krishna Mediating between the Pandavas and Kauravas.jpeg|thumb|right|x216px|text|[[Krishna]], an avatar of [[Vishnu]], [[Kurukshetra War#Krishna's peace mission|mediating for peace]] to avert the [[Kurukshetra War]] of [[Mahabharata]]]]\nThe concept of diplomatic immunity can be found in ancient Indian epics like ''[[Ramayana]]'' (between 3000 and 2000 BC) (traditional Hindu dating: over 100,000 years ago) and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (around 4th century BC; traditional Hindu dating: 3000 BC), where messengers and diplomats were given immunity from capital punishment. In [[Ramayana]], when the demon king [[Ravana]] ordered the killing of [[Hanuman]], [[Ravana]]'s younger brother [[Vibhishana]] pointed out that messengers or diplomats should not be killed, as per ancient practices.<ref>{{cite book|last=aravamudan|first=krishnan|title=Pure Gems of Ramayanam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=PartridgeIndia|isbn=978-1-4828-3720-9|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA773&dq=%22ambassadors+are+not+sentenced+to+death%22 773\u2013774]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the evolution of international justice, many wars were considered rebellions or unlawful by one or more combatant sides. In such cases, the servants of the \"criminal\" sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. [[Herodotus]] records that when heralds of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian king]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] demanded \"earth and water\" (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the [[Athens|Athenians]] threw them into a pit and the [[Sparta]]ns threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.<ref>Herodotos.

This practice was continued by the [[Rashidun caliphs]] who exchanged diplomats with the Ethiopians and the Byzantines. This diplomatic exchange continued during the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]].<ref name=Fadl>El Fadl, Khaled Abou and Russell Hopley. \"Diplomatic Immunity.\" In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Oxford Islamic Studies Online.''</ref>\n\nClassical [[Sharia]] called for hospitality to be shown towards anyone who has been granted ''am\u0101n'' (or right of safe passage). ''Am\u0101n'' was readily granted to any emissary bearing a letter or another sealed document. The duration of the ''am\u0101n'' was typically a year. Envoys with this right of passage were given immunity of person and property. They were exempt from [[taxation]], as long as they didn't engage in trade.<ref name=Fadl/>\n\nAs diplomats by definition enter the country under safe-conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honor, although there have been numerous cases in which diplomats have been killed. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights. The Mongols would often raze entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors, and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire]] after their ambassadors had been mistreated.<ref name=Prawdin>[[Michael Prawdin|Prawdin, Michael]]. ''The Mongol Empire''.</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n\nThe [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] first guaranteed [[Diplomatic Privileges Act 1708|diplomatic immunity]] to foreign ambassadors in 1709, after Count [[Andrey Matveyev]], a Russian resident in London, had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by [[Bailiff#British Isles|British bailiffs]].\n\nModern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs, and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the [[Iran hostage crisis]] is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during [[World War II]], diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents were evacuated through neutral countries.\n\nFor the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives, of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.\n\n[[War]]fare was a status of hostilities not between individuals but between their sovereigns, and the officers and officials of European governments and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, along with fraternization between officers of enemy armies during them. When prisoners, the officers usually gave their [[wikt:parole|parole]] and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during the French revolutionary wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.\n\nIn the 19th century, the [[Congress of Vienna]] reasserted the rights of diplomats; and they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.\n\nIn modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: \"So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |title=Raymond Davis and the Vienna Convention |publisher=Jinnah-institute.org |date= |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203911/http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ({{UnitedStatesCode|22|254a}} et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to [[Persona non grata|expel the diplomat]].  In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and he and his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diplomatic-immunity |title=diplomatic immunity: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==\nSome countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=List of Party States, Declarations and Reservations to Chapter III of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961 |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |date=16 April 2011 |publisher=UNITED NATIONS TREATY COLLECTION |id= |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227154400/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&lang=en |archivedate=27 December 2010 |df= }}</ref> The Convention does not cover the personnel of [[international organization]]s, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the [[Treaty|treaties]] founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on [[United Nations laissez-passer|U.N. laissez-passer]]; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an [[attach\u00e9]].\n\nOther categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).\n\nFormally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status. However, this is not universal, and diplomats have been prosecuted and jailed for crimes committed outside the country they are accredited to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saudi-diplomat-lawyer-ordered-to-pay-costs-for-frivolous-9941168|title=Saudi diplomat\u2019s lawyer ordered to pay costs for \u2018frivolous\u2019 application to Court of Appeal|author=|date=|website=channelnewsasia.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Uses and abuses==\nIn reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional [[civil service]], and are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat's career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.\n\nThe Vienna Convention is explicit that \"without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\" Nevertheless, on some occasions, diplomatic immunity leads to some unfortunate results; protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat's nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (''[[persona non grata]]''). Diplomatic agents are not, however, exempt from the jurisdiction of their home state, and hence prosecution may be undertaken by the sending state; for minor violations of the law, the sending state may impose administrative procedures specific to the foreign service or diplomatic mission.\n\nViolation of the law by diplomats has included [[espionage]], smuggling, [[child custody]] law violations, money laundering,<ref>Zabyelina, Yuliya. \u201c[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756061615000580 Respectable and Professional?

For example, the [[Autobahn 555]] in [[Cologne]], Germany was nicknamed the \"Diplomatenrennbahn\" (Diplomatic Raceway), back when [[Bonn]] was the capital of [[West Germany]], because of the numerous diplomats that used to speed through the highway under diplomatic immunity.

Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.\n\n====Rents====\n{{globalize|date=May 2017}}\nThe bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a [[diplomatic mission]]. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] says that \"the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from [[Attachment (law)|attachment]], arrest and execution\" ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1609}}). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.\n\nIn one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the U.S. State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an \"amicable agreement\" with the Zaire government.<ref name=\"Reader's Digest\"/>\n\n====Alimony and child support====\nThe issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially [[alimony]] and [[child support]], has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, in [[Beijing]]. Historically, the [[United Nations]] has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing [[sovereign immunity]].{{fact|date=September 2018}} However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of [[Legal Affairs]] for the [[United Nations]] acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfill their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the [[United Nations]]: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming U.N. dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Diplomatic+Immunity |title=Diplomatic Immunity legal definition of Diplomatic Immunity.

In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as [[central London]]'s [[congestion charge]]. It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly \u00a3100,000.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Embassy to pay congestion charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4881442.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate = 28 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an obligation for the receiving State not to \"discriminate as between states\"; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the [[diplomatic corps]] to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.\n\nDiplomats are exempt from [[import duty]] and [[tariffs]] for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of \"tax free\" goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of [[cigarette]]s per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] responses.\n\n===Espionage===\nOn 24 April 2008, in [[New Orleans]], Mexican [[press attach\u00e9]] Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] units from a [[White House]] press meeting room. Quintero made it all the way to the airport before members of the [[United States Secret Service]] caught up with him. He initially denied taking the devices, but after being confronted with security video, Quintero claimed it was purely accidental, gave the devices back, claimed diplomatic immunity and left New Orleans with the Mexican delegation. He was eventually fired for the incident.<ref>[[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352378,00.html Mexican Embassy: Official Fired After Getting Caught With White House BlackBerries]</ref>\n\n==In the United States==\n{{See also|A visa}}\nThe following chart outlines the immunities afforded to foreign diplomatic personnel residing in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/ds/c9127.htm |title=Legal Aspects of Diplomatic Immunity and Privileges |accessdate=17 January 2017 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315084126/http://www.state.gov/m/ds/immunities/c9127.htm |archivedate=15 March 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> In general, these rules follow the Vienna Convention (or the New York Convention for UN officials) and apply in other countries as well (with the exceptions of immunities for United Nations officials, which can vary widely across countries based on the \"Host Country Agreement\" signed between the UN and the host country, whereby additional immunities beyond those granted by the New York Convention may be established).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Category !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|May be arrested or detained !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|Residence may be entered subject to ordinary procedures !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|May be issued traffic ticket !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|May be subpoenaed as witness !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|May be prosecuted !! style=\"width: 13%;\"|Official family member\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Diplomatic\n!

DDR SDRAM, also called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by [[DDR2 SDRAM]], [[DDR3 SDRAM]] and [[DDR4 SDRAM]]. None of its successors are [[Forward compatibility|forward]] or [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with DDR1 SDRAM, meaning DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 [[memory module]]s will not work in DDR1-equipped [[motherboard]]s, and vice versa.\n\nCompared to single data rate ([[SDRAM#SDR SDRAM|SDR]]) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM interface makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict control of the timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as [[phase-locked loop]]s and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy.<ref>[http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf Northwest Logic DDR Phy datasheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821101233/http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp701.pdf|title=Memory Interfaces Data Capture Using Direct Clocking Technique (Xilinx application note)|author=|date=|website=xilinx.com}}</ref> The interface uses [[double data rate|double pumping]] (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the [[clock signal]]) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the [[signal integrity]] requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name \"double data rate\" refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.\n\nWith data being transferred 64 [[bit]]s at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) \u00d7 2 (for dual rate) \u00d7 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100&nbsp;MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600&nbsp;[[MB/s]].\n\n\"Beginning in 1996 and concluding in June 2000, [[JEDEC]] developed the DDR (Double Data Rate) SDRAM specification (JESD79).\"<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13805/the-love-hate-relationship-with-ddr-sdram-controllers.html\n | title = The Love/Hate Relationship with DDR SDRAM Controllers\n}}</ref>  JEDEC has set standards for data rates of DDR SDRAM, divided into two parts.

DDR SDRAM for notebook computers, [[SO-DIMM]]s, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5&nbsp;V, compared to 3.3&nbsp;V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6&nbsp;V.\n\nJEDEC Standard No. 21\u2013C defines three possible operating voltages for 184 pin DDR, as identified by the key notch position relative to its centreline.

The orientation of the module for determining the key notch position is with 52 contact positions to the left and 40 contact positions to the right.\n\nIncreasing operating voltage slightly can increase maximum speed, at the cost of higher power dissipation and heating, and at the risk of malfunctioning or damage.\n\nMany new [[chipsets]] use these memory types in [[dual-channel|multi-channel]] configurations.\n\n===Chip characteristics===\n;DRAM density: Size of the chip is measured in [[megabits]]. Most motherboards recognize only 1&nbsp;GB modules if they contain ''64M\u00d78'' chips ''(low density).'' If ''128M\u00d74 (high density)'' 1&nbsp;GB modules are used, they most likely will not work. The [[JEDEC]] standard allows ''128M\u00d74'' only for slower buffered/registered modules designed specifically for some servers, but some generic manufacturers do not comply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Myth-Low-Density-vs-High-Density-memory-modules_W0QQugidZ10000000001236178|title=Low Density vs High Density memory modules|author=|date=|website=ebay.com}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2010}}\n;Organization: The notation like ''64M\u00d74'' means that the memory matrix has 64 million (the product of ''banks'' x ''rows'' x ''columns'') 4-bit storage locations. There are ''\u00d74, \u00d78,'' and ''\u00d716'' DDR chips. The ''\u00d74'' chips allow the use of advanced error correction features like [[Chipkill]], [[memory scrubbing]] and Intel SDDC in server environments, while the ''\u00d78'' and ''\u00d716'' chips are somewhat less expensive. ''x8'' chips are mainly used in desktops/notebooks but are making entry into the server market. There are normally 4 banks and only one row can be active in each bank.\n\n===Module characteristics===\n;Ranks:\n\nTo increase memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips with the common address lines are called a [[memory rank]]. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal '''rows''' and '''banks'''. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term '''sides''' would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module.\n\nAll ranks are connected to the same memory bus (address + data). The [[Chip Select]] signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.\n\nAdding modules to the single memory bus creates additional electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|memory bottleneck]], new [[chipsets]] employ the [[dual-channel|multi-channel]] architecture.\n\n;Capacity\n;Number of DRAM devices: The number of chips is a multiple of 8 for non-[[Error-correcting code|ECC]] modules and a multiple of 9 for ECC modules. Chips can occupy one side (''single sided'') or both sides (''dual sided'') of the module. The maximal number of chips per DDR module is 36 (9\u00d74) for ECC and 32 (8x4) for non-ECC.\n;ECC vs non-ECC: Modules that have [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting memory|error-correcting code]] are labeled as [[dynamic random-access memory#Error detection and correction|ECC]].  Modules without error correcting code are labeled '''non-ECC'''.\n;Timings: [[CAS latency]] (CL), clock cycle time (t<sub>CK</sub>), row cycle time (t<sub>RC</sub>), refresh row cycle time (t<sub>RFC</sub>), row active time (t<sub>RAS</sub>).\n;Buffering: [[Registered memory|registered]] (or buffered) vs [[Unbuffered memory|unbuffered]].\n;Packaging: Typically [[DIMM]] or [[SO-DIMM]].\n;Power consumption: A test with DDR and DDR2 RAM in 2005 found that average power consumption appeared to be of the [[Order of magnitude|order]] of 1\u20133&nbsp;W per 512&nbsp;MB module; this increases with clock rate and when in use rather than idling.<ref>[http://www.silentpcreview.com/article265-page4.html Mike Chin: Power Distribution within Six PCs].</ref><!--Out of order and from 2003, but very useful <ref>[http://www.overclockers.com/articles696/]</ref>--> A manufacturer has produced calculators to estimate the power used by various types of RAM.<ref>[https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc Micron: System Power Calculators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126211816/https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc |date=2016-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nModule and chip characteristics are inherently linked.\n\nTotal module capacity is a product of one chip's capacity and the number of chips. ECC modules multiply it by 8/9 because they use 1&nbsp;bit per byte (8&nbsp;bits) for error correction. A module of any particular size can therefore be assembled either from 32 small chips (36 for ECC memory), or 16(18) or 8(9) bigger ones.\n\nDDR memory bus width per channel is 64 bits (72 for ECC memory). Total module bit width is a product of bits per chip and number of chips. It also equals number of ranks (rows) multiplied by DDR memory bus width. Consequently, a module with a greater number of chips or using \u00d78 chips instead of \u00d74 will have more ranks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example: Variations of 1&nbsp;GB PC2100 registered DDR SDRAM module with ECC\n!

One should definitely be careful buying 1&nbsp;GB memory modules, because all these variations can be sold under one price position without stating whether they are \u00d74 or \u00d78, single- or dual-ranked.\n\nThere is a common belief that number of module ranks equals number of sides. As above data shows, this is not true.  One can also find 2-side/1-rank modules. One can even think of a 1-side/2-rank memory module having 16(18) chips on single side \u00d78 each, but it's unlikely such a module was ever produced.\n\n===History===\n\n====Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM specification====\nFrom Ballot JCB-99-70, and modified by numerous other Board Ballots, formulated under the cognizance of Committee JC-42.3 on DRAM Parametrics.\n\nStandard No. 79 Revision Log:\n*Release 1, June 2000\n*Release 2, May 2002\n*Release C, March 2003 \u2013 JEDEC Standard No. 79C.<ref>http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD79F.pdf DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) SDRAM SPECIFICATION (Release F)</ref>\n\n\"This comprehensive standard defines all required aspects of 64Mb through 1Gb DDR SDRAMs with X4/X8/X16 data interfaces, including features, functionality, ac and dc parametrics, packages and pin assignments. This scope will subsequently be expanded to formally apply to x32 devices, and higher density devices as well.\"\n\n===Organization===\nPC3200 is DDR SDRAM designed to operate at 200&nbsp;MHz using DDR-400 chips with a bandwidth of 3,200&nbsp;MB/s.  Because PC3200 memory transfers data on both the rising and falling clock edges, its effective clock rate is 400&nbsp;MHz.\n\n1&nbsp;GB PC3200 non-ECC modules are usually made with 16 512&nbsp;Mbit chips, 8 on each side (512&nbsp;Mbits \u00d7 16&nbsp;chips) / (8 bits (per byte)) = 1,024&nbsp;MB.  The individual chips making up a 1&nbsp;GB memory module are usually organized as 2<sup>26</sup> 8-bit words, commonly expressed as 64M\u00d78.  Memory manufactured in this way is low-density RAM and is usually compatible with any motherboard specifying PC3200 DDR-400 memory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superuser.com/questions/138800/per-bytes-ram-memory-acess|title=Per bytes RAM memory acess|website=Super User|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===High-density RAM===\nIn the context of the 1&nbsp;GB non-ECC PC3200 SDRAM module, there is very little visually to differentiate low-density from high-density RAM.  High-density DDR RAM modules will, like their low-density counterparts, usually be [[double-sided RAM|double-sided]] with eight 512&nbsp;Mbit chips per side.  The difference is that each chip, instead of being organized as 64M\u00d78, is organized as 2<sup>27</sup> 4-bit words, or 128M\u00d74.\n\nHigh-density memory modules are assembled using chips from multiple manufacturers.  These chips come in both the familiar 22 \u00d7 10&nbsp;mm (approx.) TSOP2 and smaller squarer 12 \u00d7 9&nbsp;mm (approx.) FBGA package sizes.  High-density chips can be identified by the numbers on each chip.\n\nHigh-density RAM devices were designed to be used in registered memory modules for servers.  JEDEC standards do not apply to high-density DDR RAM in desktop implementations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} JEDEC's technical documentation, however, supports 128M\u00d74 semiconductors {{clarify span|as such that contradicts 128\u00d74 being classified as high-density|date=December 2017}}. As such, ''high density'' is a relative term, which can be used to describe memory that is not supported by a particular motherboard's memory controller.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Variations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Competing with DDR2 was [[Rambus]] [[XDR DRAM]]. DDR2 dominated due to cost and support factors.  DDR2 was in turn superseded by [[DDR3 SDRAM]], which offered higher performance for increased bus speeds and new features.  DDR3 has been superseded by [[DDR4 SDRAM]], which was first produced in 2011 and whose standards were still in flux (2012) with significant architectural changes.\n\nDDR's prefetch buffer depth is 2 (bits), while DDR2 uses 4.  Although the effective clock rates of DDR2 are higher than DDR, the overall performance was not greater in the early implementations, primarily due to the high latencies of the first DDR2 modules.  DDR2 started to be effective by the end of 2004, as modules with lower latencies became available.<ref>[http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html DDR2 vs. DDR: Revenge Gained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121045622/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html |date=2006-11-21 }}</ref>\n\nMemory manufacturers stated that it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400&nbsp;MHz (i.e. 400&nbsp;MT/s and 200&nbsp;MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal clock rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400&nbsp;MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal clock rates while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.\n\nThe DDR4 SDRAM is a high-speed dynamic random-access memory internally configured as 16 banks, 4 bank groups with 4\nbanks for each bank group for x4/x8 and 8 banks, 2 bank groups with 4 banks for each bank group for x16 DRAM.\nThe DDR4 SDRAM uses a 8n prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed operation. The 8n prefetch architecture is combined with\nan interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins. A single read or write operation for the DDR4 SDRAM\nconsists of a single 8''n''-bit-wide 4-clock data transfer at the internal DRAM core and 8 corresponding ''n''-bit-wide half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O pins.<ref>{{cite web|title=DDR4 SDRAM Standard JESD79-4B|url=https://www.jedec.org}}</ref>\n\n[[RDRAM]] was a particularly expensive alternative to DDR SDRAM, and most manufacturers dropped its support from their chipsets.  DDR1 memory's prices substantially increased since Q2 2008, while DDR2 prices declined. In January 2009, 1&nbsp;GB DDR1 was 2\u20133 times more expensive than 1&nbsp;GB DDR2.  High-density DDR RAM suit about 10% of PC motherboards on the market, while low-density suit almost all motherboards on the PC Desktop market.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==MDDR==\nMDDR is an acronym that some enterprises use for [[Mobile DDR]] SDRAM, a type of memory used in some portable electronic devices, like [[mobile phone]]s, [[handheld]]s, and [[digital audio player]]s.

Elliott in 2000}}<!--at 1:20:45--></ref> known simply as '''Don Rosa''' (born June 29, 1951), is an American [[comic book]] writer and illustrator known for his stories about [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Donald Duck]], and other Disney characters. Many of his stories are built on characters and locations created by [[Carl Barks]]; among these was \"[[The Son of the Sun]]\" (1987), which was nominated for a [[Harvey Award]] in the \"Best Story of the Year\" category.\n\nRosa created about 90 stories between 1987 and 2006. In 1995, his 12-chapter work ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'' won the [[Eisner Award]] for \"Best Serialized Story\".\n\n==Early life==\nDon Rosa's grandfather, Gioachino Rosa, lived in [[Maniago]], a town at the foot of the [[Alps]] in [[Northern Italy]], in the province of [[Pordenone]]. He emigrated to [[Kentucky]], United States around 1900, established a successful tile and [[terrazzo]] company, then returned to Italy to marry and start a family. In 1915 just after the birth of his son Ugo Rosa, Gioachino returned to Kentucky with his wife, two daughters and two sons. Ugo Rosa grew up and was later married in Kentucky. His wife was born to a [[German American]] father and a mother with both Scottish and Irish ancestry.\n\nDon Rosa was born Keno Don Hugo Rosa on June 29, 1951 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He was named after both his father and grandfather. Gioachino was called \"Keno\" for short. Don's father was named Ugo Dante Rosa, but used the name \"Hugo Don\" Rosa in America.\n\nRosa was exposed to comics at a very early age, as his 11-year-older sister was a comics hoarder and had a large number of comics, which made it possible for Rosa to discover comics as a storytelling medium by just \"reading the pictures\" and later also actually read. Rosa also began drawing comics before being able to write. The characters he would typically draw were a large cast of stick figures which he usually featured in comedy/adventures of a Barksian style, since the Carl Barks' stories were the ones Rosa was most fond of. Rosa stuck to draw simple stick figures for these stories since these were just mere illustrations and a mean of getting the story told. The story was the pinnacle to him, not the actual drawings. Rosa kept drawing the stick figure stories until he attended High school at [[St. Xavier High School (Louisville)]], Kentucky.\n\nRosa's favorite comic books while growing up were ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' by [[Western Publishing]] and ''[[Little Lulu]]'' comics from [[Dell Comics]], as well as his sister's collection of [[MAD magazine]]s and comics. When Rosa became 12 years old he also discovered and started to enjoy the [[Superman]] titles of [[DC Comics]] especially from the editor [[Mort Weisinger]]'s period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists [[Curt Swan]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]. Shortly after Rosa started to collect Superman comics he also began to trade in the comics he had inherited from his older sister for new Superman comics. The reason behind this action was that a comic book shop in his living area offered to trade two used old comics for one new, a sound deal for the young Rosa. By the 1970s Rosa's comic trading had ended up with him only having two Disney duck comics issues left from the collection his sister originally passed on to him. One of them being ''[[Dell Comics]]' [[Four Color]] Comics #386'' (also known as Dell Comics' One shot's) issue titled: ''\"Uncle Scrooge in [[Only a Poor Old Man]]\"'', the other issue being ''[[Walt Disney's Comics & Stories]] #146'', also by Dell Comics.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_0uOE3QVhk Don Rosa House tour - Comic vault - Retrieved 2018-02-02</ref> Later when Rosa became a serious collector of older comics, except from Carl Bark's duck comics he particularly enjoys and collect the classic [[E.C. Comics]] of the horror and science fiction genres published in the 1950s, [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[The Spirit]]'', [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'', and most comics from the [[golden age of comic books]] and onward.\n\nRosa entered the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1969. He graduated in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[civil engineering]].<ref name=\"STP\"/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1969 while still in college, Rosa won an award as \"best political cartoonist in the nation in a college paper\".<ref>Stajano, Francesco.

I'd much rather be doing comedy adventure. But I must have done something right, for at one point ''[[The Journal of Higher Education]]'' named me one of the five or six best college newspaper cartoonists in the nation.\"<ref name=\"Blum\">[[Geoffrey Blum|Blum, Geoffrey]] (1987). ''Portrait of the Artist as a Duck Man'', ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #219, July, 1987 (editorial to introduce Rosa to the readers, as part of the original publication of Rosa's very first Duck story, \"[[The Son of the Sun]]\").</ref>\n\n[[File:DonRosa-2.jpg|thumb|right|Don Rosa in his home in 2010|275px]]\nRosa's first published comic (besides the spot illustrations in his grade school and high school newspapers) was a comic strip featuring his own character, [[Lancelot Pertwillaby]], titled ''[[The Pertwillaby Papers]]''. He created the strip in 1971 for ''[[The Kentucky Kernel]]'', a college newspaper of the [[University of Kentucky]], which wanted the strip to focus on political satire.\n\nRosa later switched the strip to comedy-adventure, his favorite style of comics, and drew the story ''Lost in (an alternative section of) the Andes''. (The title is a reference to ''[[Lost in the Andes!]]'', a Donald Duck story by Carl Barks, first published in April, 1949.) The so-called ''[[The Pertwillaby Papers|Pertwillaby Papers]]'' included 127 published episodes by the time Rosa graduated in 1973.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosa participated in contributing art and articles to comic collector [[fanzines]]. One contribution was ''An Index of Uncle Scrooge Comics''. According to his introduction: ''\"Scrooge being my favorite character in comic history and Barks my favorite pure cartoonist, I'll try not to get carried away too much.\"''\n\nAfter attaining his bachelor's degree, Rosa continued to draw comics purely as a hobby, his only income came from working in the ''Keno Rosa Tile Company'', a company founded by his paternal grandfather and which had been taken over by Hugo Rosa.\n\nRosa authored and illustrated the monthly \"Information Center\" column in the fanzine ''\"[[Rocket's Blast Comicollector]]\"'' from 1974 to 1979. This was a question-and-answer feature dealing with readers' queries on all forms of pop entertainment of which Rosa was a student, including comics, TV and movies. He also revived the ''Pertwillaby Papers'' in this \"RBCC\" fanzine as a comic book style story rather than a newspaper comic strip from 1976 to 1978.\n\nBy now having become a locally known comics collector and cartoonist, Rosa accepted an offer from the editor of the local newspaper to create a weekly comic strip. This led to his creation of the comic strip character [[Captain Kentucky]] for the Saturday edition of the local newspaper ''[[Louisville Times]]''. Captain Kentucky was the superhero alter ego of Lancelot Pertwillaby. The pay was $25/week and not worth the 12+ hours each week's strip entailed, but Rosa did it as part of his hobby. Publication started on October 6, 1979. The comic strip ended on August 15, 1982 after the publication of 150 episodes. After three years with Captain Kentucky, Don decided that it was not worth the effort. He retired from cartooning and did not draw a single line for the next four years. Years later, as his fame grew, his non-Disney work was published by the Norwegian publisher Gazette Bok in 2001, in the two hard-cover \"Don Rosa Archives\" volumes, ''The Pertwillaby Papers'' and ''[[The Adventures of Captain Kentucky]]''.\n\n===Gladstone===\nIn 1986, Rosa discovered a [[Gladstone Publishing]] comic book. This was the first American comic book that contained [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters since Western Publishing's discontinuation of their [[Whitman Comics]] in 1984.  Since early childhood Don Rosa had been fascinated by Carl Barks' stories about [[Donald Duck]] and [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Artist [[Carl Barks]] was a big idol for him and would remain so for the rest of his career. He immediately called the editor, [[Byron Erickson]], and told him that he was the only American who was born to write and draw one Scrooge McDuck adventure. Erickson agreed to let him send a story, and Don Rosa started drawing his first Duck story, \"[[The Son of the Sun]],\" the very next day.\n\n\"The Son of the Sun\" was a success and Rosa's very first professional comic story was nominated for a [[Harvey Award]] \"Best Story of the Year\". The plot of the story was the same as his earlier story, ''Lost in (an alternative section of) the Andes''. As Don Rosa explained it, he was just \"(...) turning that old Pertwillaby Papers adventure back into the story it originally was in my head, starring Scrooge, Donald, [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck|the nephews]], and [[Flintheart Glomgold]].\"\n\nRosa created a few more comics for Gladstone until 1989. He then stopped working for them, because the policies of their licensor, Disney, did not allow for the return of original art for a story to its creators. This was unacceptable to Don Rosa, since a part of his income came from selling the originals, and the original art is the property of the freelance artists, unless otherwise agreed upon. Without that extra money, he could not make a living drawing comic books.\n\nAfter making some stories for the Dutch publisher Oberon, the publishers of an American Disney children's magazine called ''[[DuckTales]]'' (based on the animated series of the same name) offered Rosa employment. They even offered him a much higher salary than the one he received at Gladstone. Rosa made just one script (''Back in Time for a Dime''). The publishers never asked him to make more, and due to problems with receiving the payment, he did not care.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Egmont===\nAfter working with the DuckTales magazine, Rosa found out that the Danish publisher [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] (at that time called Gutenberghus) was publishing reprints of his stories and wanted more. Rosa joined Egmont in 1990. Two years later, at Rosa's suggestion, [[Byron Erickson]], the former editor at Gladstone also went to work for Egmont and has been working there as an editor and later as a freelancer.\n\nIn 1991 Rosa started creating ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a 12 chapter story about his favorite character. The series was a success, and in 1995 he won an [[Eisner Award]] for best continuing series. After the end of the original series, Rosa sometimes produced additional \"missing\" chapters. Some of the extra chapters were turned down by Egmont, because they were not interested in any more episodes. Fortunately, the French magazine ''[[Picsou]]'' was eager to publish the stories. From 1999, Rosa started working freelance for Picsou magazine as well. All of these chapters were compiled as ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Companion]]''.\n\n===On strike===\nDuring early summer 2002, Rosa suddenly laid down work. As an artist he could not live under the conditions Egmont was offering him, but he did not want to give up making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and try to come to an agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or [[pixelated]] computer conversions of the illustrations. Another matter was that his name was used in promotion of books and collections of stories without his agreement and without sending royalties to him. Rosa has never, as with any other Disney artist, received royalties for a single use of any of his stories worldwide.<ref>He describes this system here: http://career-end.donrosa.de/</ref>\n\nRosa came to an agreement with Egmont in December of the same year, which gave him a bit more control over the stories and the manner in which they were publicized.\n\n===Retirement===\nRosa's eyesight had been very poor since his childhood. In 2006 and 2007 he began having new difficulties, which made drawing a very slow and tedious process for him, even more so than normally. In March 2008, Rosa suffered a severe retinal detachment and underwent emergency eye surgery that proved to be only partially successful. Further surgery in both eyes made drawing even more difficult. On June 2, 2008, during an interview at the Danish Komiks.dk fair, Rosa stated that he would not do any more Disney comics, citing eye troubles, low pay, and the constant use of his stories in special hardback or album editions by international Disney licensees without any payment of royalties or requests for permission for the use of his name.<ref>[http://dcf.outducks.org/viewtopic.php?id=239&p=2 Message board post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329110205/http://dcf.outducks.org/viewtopic.php?id=239&p=2 |date=March 29, 2010 }} from Danish writer Lars Jensen, and [http://dcf.outducks.org/viewtopic.php?id=239&p=3 specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063056/http://dcf.outducks.org/viewtopic.php?id=239&p=3 |date=July 24, 2011 }} by Sigvald Gr\u00f8sfjeld jr., owner and maintainer of http://duckman.pettho.com/</ref>\n\nRosa is very popular with readers in Europe.

Rosa enjoys including subtle references to his favorite works of fiction as well as his own previous work. He normally uses about 12 panels per page, instead of the more common eight. He needs to use the extra panels, because his stories usually are too long to be published if he does not minimize them.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nRosa has an especially large following in Finland, and in 1999, he created a special 32-page adventure featuring Scrooge McDuck for his Finnish fans called; ''Sammon Salaisuus'' (translates to ''The secret of the [[Sampo]]'', but it is officially named ''[[The Quest for Kalevala]]''<ref>{{Cite web\n | url =http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1023?articleID=47103  | title = Scoop \u2013 Where the Magic of Collecting Comes Alive! \u2013 Don Rosa and The Quest for Kalevala | accessdate=2013-03-04\n |date=2004-09-25}}</ref> in English), based on the Finnish national epic, the [[Kalevala]]. The publication of this story created a national sensation in Finland where Donald Duck and the Kalevala are important aspects of culture. It was published in many other countries as well. The cover for the comic book was a spoof of a [[The Defense of the Sampo|famous painting]] by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]].\n\nThe latest work that Rosa has worked on is a cover for the album ''[[Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge]]'' by [[Tuomas Holopainen]] from [[Nightwish]].<ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://comicsalliance.com/don-rosa-tuomas-holopainen-nightwish-the-life-and-times-of-scrooge-album-art/ \n |title=Don Rosa Does The Art For A Prog Rock Concept Album About Scrooge McDuck From Finland \n |accessdate=2015-05-07 \n |date=2014-02-26 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060909/http://comicsalliance.com/don-rosa-tuomas-holopainen-nightwish-the-life-and-times-of-scrooge-album-art/ \n |archivedate=April 29, 2015 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}</ref>\n\n===Drawing style===\nWith a bachelor of arts degree in civil engineering as his only real drawing education, Rosa has some unusual drawing methods, as he writes: ''\"I suspect '''nothing''' I do is done the way anyone else does it.\"''\n\nBecause of being self-taught in making comics, Rosa relies mostly on the skills he learned in engineering school, which means using [[technical pen]]s and templates extensively. He applies templates and other engineering tools to draw curves, circles and ovals. He usually drew just under a page per day, but that depended on the amount of detail he puts in the picture.\n\nRosa's drawing style is considered much more detailed and \"dirtier\" than that of most other Disney artists, living or dead, and often likened to that of [[underground comix|underground artists]], and he is frequently compared to [[Robert Crumb]].<ref>{{Cite web\n | url =http://didierghez.com/_private/interviu/rosaang.html | title = ''Interview with Don Rosa'', by Didier Ghez, June 1996| accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref> When Rosa was first told of this similarity, he said that he \"drew that bad\" long before he discovered underground comics during college. He went on to explain these similarities to underground artists with a similar background of making comics as a hobby:\n\n:''\"I think that both my style and that of Robert Crumb are similar only because we both grew up making comics for our personal enjoyment, without ever taking drawing seriously, and without ever trying to attain a style that would please the average comics publisher. We drew comics for fun!\"''<ref>[http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/2002-October/014539.html ''Rosa's First Steps''], translated back from Greek original article in ''Komix'' magazine #172, September 2002, translated by Kriton Kyrimis</ref>\n\n===Carl Barks===\n<blockquote>''\"I want to take everything Barks wrote and forge it into a workable timeline. My original dream was to become the new Carl Barks. I wanted to write, draw, and letter all my own stories. People tell me that my pencils look just like Barks, but my inks are pure Rosa, and I can't letter properly! So I'll have to settle for being Don Rosa.\"'' \u2013 Don Rosa in 1987<ref name=\"Blum\" /></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''\"Don Rosa has often been called the heir of Carl Barks, especially for the way in which he has carried on the Ducks' Family Saga. But I don't think so: in my opinion Don Rosa ''[...]'' is an author who has used Barks' characters to make stories that are completely new, 'Donrosian' rather than 'Barksian', just like Barks can't be considered the heir of [[Al Taliaferro]] only because he has worked on the Ducks after him.\"'' \u2013 [[Carlo Chendi]], Italian Disney comics writer<ref>Chendi, Carlo. ''Don Rosa and me'', in Castagno 2011, p. 17</ref></blockquote>\n\nRosa's idol when it comes to comics is [[Carl Barks]]. Rosa builds almost all his stories on characters and locations that Barks invented. Many of Rosa's stories contain references to some fact pointed out in a Barks story. At the request of publishers in response to reader demands, Rosa has even created sequels of old Barks stories. For example, his ''[[Return to Plain Awful]]'' is a sequel to ''[[Lost in the Andes!]]'', where the Ducks return to the same hidden country. To add more to his admiration and consistency to Barks and Barks' stories, Rosa makes all his ducks' stories set in the 1950s. This is because Barks writes most of the stories about Scrooge, Donald and all people of Duckburg in the 1950s (it also conveniently resolves potential continuity problems, such as Scrooge's age). As explained in text pages in the ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' and its companion volume, Rosa does intense research of time periods to ensure not only that he gets the physical details right, but also to ensure that all characters could have been present.\n\nBarks either created most of the characters used by Rosa or is credited for greatly developing their personalities. Rosa thus feels obliged to make his stories factually consistent. He has spent a lot of time in making lists of facts and anecdotes pointed out in different stories by his mentor. Especially ''The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' was based mostly on the earlier works of Barks. Rosa admitted however that a scene of the first chapter was inspired by a story by [[Tony Strobl]].\n\nAs most of the characters Rosa uses were created by Barks, and because Rosa considers Scrooge rather than Donald to be the main character of the Duck universe, he does not regard himself as a pure Disney artist, nor the characters really as Disney's. \"Rosa prefers to say that the characters he uses are Barks's, Barks having reshaped Donald Duck's personality and creating everything else we know of Duckburg while working as a freelancer in 1942\u20131967 for an independent licensed publisher (Dell/Western Comics). Barks even claimed to have also created [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] while working as a writer on Donald Duck animated cartoons in 1937.\" Because of his idolization of Barks, he repeatedly discourages his fans to use an absolutist way of saying his clearly different drawing style would be better than Barks's, and he found that notion confirmed when Barks himself spoke about Rosa's style in a critical tone though it is uncertain whether those comments were Barks's or those of his temporary \"business managers\" who filtered his communications.\n\n[[File:DonRosa faces.jpg|thumb|Unlike his idol [[Carl Barks]], Rosa uses a lot of funny, bizarre faces and slapstick in his stories. Sequence from ''Incident at McDuck Tower'' (''Donald and Scrooge #1'', 1991, [[INDUCKS]] story code [http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+90345 D+90345]).]]<blockquote>''\"I usually don't like my stories. I mean I try really hard, but I know I don't draw that well. I know people like it because it's got lots of extra details, but art directors know good artwork, and they know mine is not good artwork. Now, people always say, 'You're being too modest, you're being too modest', and I say, 'What?' They just have to ask me the right question. I know it's not good artwork and I don't know if it's well-drawn, but I know it's entertaining.\"'' \u2013 Don Rosa, Torino Comics Festival, April 2011<ref>[http://www.vimeo.com/22336330 ''Don Rosa Conference \u2013 Torino Comics 2011''] (18:05\u201318:40 min)</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''\"Don Rosa has a style that is a little bit different from the Disney style. I know that there is a great deal of people that like that style, which is extremely detailed. So there is room in the business for artists like Don Rosa and for others like [[William Van Horn|Van Horn]]. They have a different style. But if they have a good story and tell it properly, then people are going to like it.\"'' \u2013 Carl Barks, interview given at [[Disneyland Paris]], July 7, 1994<ref>Durand, S\u00e9bastien; Ghez, Didier (1994){{Cite web\n | url =http://didierghez.com/_private/interviu/barks.html | title = ''Interview with Carl Barks'', by S\u00e9bastien Durand and Didier Ghez, July 7, 1994| accessdate=2013-03-04 |publisher=The Ultimate Disney Books Network}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBeside Rosa's constant effort to remain faithful to the universe Barks created, there is also a number of notable differences between the two artists. The most obvious of these is Rosa's much more detailed drawing style, often with many background gags, which has been credited as being a result of Rosa's love of the [[Will Elder]] stories of [[Mad (magazine)|MAD comics and magazines]]. While Barks himself discouraged the use of extreme grimacing and gesturing in any other panel for comical or dramatic effect,<ref>''\"Those sight gags are quite limited. You know, there are only so many things you can do with a human body or a duck body and then you start repeating yourself, otherwise you'd kill him.\"'', [http://www.cbarks.dk/theartistrycomicswriting.htm www.cbarks.com: ''The artistry: Comics writing''], ''\"Avoid excessive distortion of beak and brows. Tilting eyes is key to most expressions. ''[...]'' Use this eye tilting cautiously! It's awfully easy to tilt these eyes '''too far'''!\", ''[http://www.cbarks.dk/themodelsheets1950donald1.htm Barks model sheet #1], 1950, ''\"Using the hands to 'talk' with is fine '''sometimes'''. But '''this''' kind of emphasizing is wearing on the reader! ''[...]'' Overacting can be overdone. Save big takes for direst calamities!\", ''[http://www.cbarks.dk/themodelsheets1950donald2.htm Barks model sheet #2], 1950</ref> Rosa's stories are rich with colorful and bizarre facial renditions and physical slapstick. Barks had over 600 Duck stories to his name while Rosa only created 85 until his eye trouble set in, but whereas Barks made many short one and two-pagers centered around a subtle, compact gag, Rosa's oeuvre consists almost exclusively of long adventure stories.\n\nAndrea \"Bramo\" Bramini identifies the following four differences between Barks's and Rosa's way of storytelling:<ref>Bramini, Andrea \"Bramo\". ''A faitfhul heir for Carl Barks?'' in Castagno 2011, pp. 295\u2013298</ref>\n* Rosa follows a very strict continuity, while Barks paid very little attention to continuity between stories.\n* Rosa's characterization of Scrooge is that of a much more sentimental person for often relishing his memories of past adventures.\n* Barks situated his stories in the present day of when he was creating them, and had a penchant for satire. Rosa strictly writes stories taking place in an era at least half a century prior to their creation, and mostly abstains from any political or social commentary.\n* With his engineering degree, Rosa often goes to great lengths to give scientifically plausible explanations within his stories, whereas Barks never cared much for any detailed scientific rationalizations to his stories.\n\n===D.U.C.K.===\nMost of Rosa's stories have the letters D.U.C.K. hidden within either the first panel or, if Rosa has created the cover art, within the cover art itself.  D.U.C.K. is an acronym for \"'''D'''edicated to '''U'''ncle '''C'''arl from '''K'''eno\" (Carl being [[Carl Barks]] and Keno being Rosa's given first name). Rosa began this practice in response to Disney's objection to personal signatures in their comics. After Disney discovered Rosa's inclusion of D.U.C.K. in his work, they objected again, forcing Rosa to hide the letters in various and unlikely places within his drawings. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nRosa has drawn covers for reprints of Carl Barks stories and has included his signature D.U.C.K. within them as well.\n\n===Mickeys===\nAnother curiosity is his [[Hidden Mickey]]s. Rosa is only interested in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small [[Mickey Mouse]] heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An example of this is in the story ''[[The Terror of the Transvaal]]'' where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant's foot. This is mostly a gag done for the fun of it. Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.\n\nIn the story ''[[Attack of the Hideous Space-Varmints]]'', the asteroid with Uncle Scrooge's money bin on it crashes into the Moon along with two missiles, creating a large Mickey Mouse head on the surface. When [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] tell Donald that the missiles hit the \"dark\" (far) side of the Moon, Donald is thankful no one is going to see it&nbsp; \u2014 \"For a minute there, I thought we were going to have some legal problems.\"\n\nIn the second Rosa story featuring [[The Three Caballeros]], Donald Duck is shocked by the sight of a [[capybara]] standing on its hind legs, with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]] and [[Panchito Pistoles]], never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is just tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a [[poaching|poacher]]. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.\n\nIn ''[[The Quest for Kalevala]]'' this running gag can be seen on the original, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]-inspired cover art. In the original work, [[Louhi]] is depicted as bare-chested, but the Disneyfied version has been drawn a top, of fabric patterned with Mickey Mouse heads.\n\n==Awards==\n[[File:Don Rosa Dragon Con 2009.JPG|thumb|Rosa at [[Dragon Con]], in 2009|270px]]\nHis work has won Rosa a good deal of recognition in the industry, including nominations for the Comics' Buyer's Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, and 1999. [[Heidi MacDonald]] of [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] also mentioned Rosa's 1994 story ''[[Guardians of the Lost Library]]'' as ''\"possibly the greatest comic book story of all time\"''.\n\nIn 1995 Rosa was awarded the [[Eisner Award]] for \"Best Serialized Story\" for ''The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck''.

The Kaufmans soon settled in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], where Vertov began writing [[poetry]], [[science fiction]] and [[satire]]. In 1916-1917 Vertov was studying medicine at the Psychoneurological Institute in Saint Petersburg and experimenting with \"sound collages\" in his free time. He eventually adopted the name \"Dziga Vertov\", which translates loosely from [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as 'spinning top'.<ref>Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction: A Very Short Introduction by Patricia Aufderheide; Oxford University Press, 28 November 2007, page 37</ref>\n\n===Early writings===\nVertov is known for many early writings, mainly while still in school, that focus on the individual versus the perceptive nature of the camera lens, which he was known to call his \"second eye\".\n\nMost of Vertov's early work was unpublished, and few manuscripts survived after the [[World War II|Second World War]], though some material surfaced in later films and documentaries created by Vertov and his brothers, [[Boris Kaufman]] and [[Mikhail Kaufman]].\n\nVertov is known for quotes on perception, and its ineffability, in relation to the nature of qualia (sensory experiences).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://dziga-vertov.journal-of-life.com/#!biographies|title=Dziga Vertov|accessdate=2 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===After the October Revolution===\nAfter the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, at the age of 22, Vertov began editing for ''Kino-Nedelya'' ({{lang|ru|\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e-\u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f}}, the Moscow Cinema Committee's weekly film series, and the first newsreel series in Russia), which first came out in June 1918. While working for ''Kino-Nedelya'' he met his future wife, the film director and editor, [[Yelizaveta Svilova|Elizaveta Svilova]], who at the time was working as an editor at [[Goskino]]. She began collaborating with Vertov, beginning as his editor but becoming assistant and co-director in subsequent films, such as ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' (1929), and ''[[Three Songs About Lenin]]'' (1934).\n\nVertov worked on the ''Kino-Nedelya'' series for three years, helping establish and run a film-car on [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s [[agit-train]] during the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]] between [[Communist]]s and [[counterrevolutionary|counterrevolutionaries]]. Some of the cars on the agit-trains were equipped with actors for live performances or [[printing press]]es; Vertov's had equipment to shoot, develop, edit, and project film. The trains went to battlefronts on [[agitprop|agitation-propaganda]] missions intended primarily to bolster the morale of the troops; they were also intended to stir up revolutionary fervor of the masses.\n\nIn 1919, Vertov compiled newsreel footage for his documentary ''Anniversary of the Revolution;'' in 1921 he compiled ''History of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]].'' The so-called \"Council of Three,\" a group issuing manifestoes in [[LEF (journal)|LEF]], a radical Russian newsmagazine, was established in 1922; the group's \"three\" were Vertov, his (future) wife and editor Elizaveta Svilova, and his brother and [[cinematographer]] [[Mikhail Kaufman]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmtillnowsurve00roth#page/167/mode/2up|pages=167\u2013170||author=[[Paul Rotha]]|title=The film till now, a survey of the cinema|year=1930|publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}</ref> Vertov's interest in machinery led to a curiosity about the mechanical basis of [[film|cinema]].\n\n====''Kino-Pravda''====\nIn 1922, the year that ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' was released, Vertov started the ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Rt0Wwjs4zyYC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=In+1922,+the+year+that+Nanook+of+the+North+was+released,+Vertov+started+the+Kino-Pravda+series&source=bl&ots=E4Vn131lYg&sig=TOV2BTLHVI06hMKCIgWSoH9DF9I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOke3yq__YAhXLYo8KHTwZCL4Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=In%201922,%20the%20year%20that%20Nanook%20of%20the%20North%20was%20released,%20Vertov%20started%20the%20Kino-Pravda%20series&f=false|title=A New History of Documentary Film: Second Edition|last=McLane|first=Betsy A.|date=5 April 2012|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9781441124579|language=en}}</ref> The series took its title from the official government newspaper ''[[Pravda]]''. \"Kino-Pravda\" (literally translated, \"film truth\") continued Vertov's agit-prop bent. \"The Kino-Pravda group began its work in a basement in the centre of Moscow\" Vertov explained. He called it damp and dark. There was an earthen floor and holes one stumbled into at every turn. Dziga said, \"This dampness prevented our reels of lovingly edited film from sticking together properly, rusted our scissors and our splicers.\" \"Before dawn- damp, cold, teeth chattering- I wrap comrade Svilova in a third jacket.\" [quotation source needed]\n\nVertov's driving vision, expounded in his frequent essays, was to capture \"film truth\"&mdash;that is, fragments of actuality which, when organized together, have a deeper truth that cannot be seen with the naked eye. In the ''Kino-Pravda'' series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first. The episodes of ''Kino-Pravda'' usually did not include reenactments or stagings (one exception is the segment about the [[1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries|trial of the Social Revolutionaries]]: the scenes of the selling of the newspapers on the streets and the people reading the papers in the trolley were both staged for the camera). The cinematography is simple, functional, unelaborate&mdash;perhaps a result of Vertov's disinterest in both \"beauty\" and the \"grandeur of fiction.\" Twenty-three issues of the series were produced over a period of three years; each issue lasted about twenty minutes and usually covered three topics. The stories were typically descriptive, not narrative, and included vignettes and expos\u00e9s, showing for instance the renovation of a trolley system, the organization of farmers into communes, and the trial of Social Revolutionaries; one story shows starvation in the nascent [[Communism|Communist]] state. Propagandistic tendencies are also present, but with more subtlety, in the episode featuring the construction of an airport: one shot shows the former [[Tsar]]'s tanks helping prepare a foundation, with an intertitle reading \"Tanks on the labor front.\"\n\nVertov clearly intended an active relationship with his audience in the series&mdash;in the final segment he includes contact information&mdash;but by the 14th episode the series had become so experimental that some critics dismissed Vertov's efforts as \"insane\". Vertov responds to their criticisms with the assertion that the critics were hacks nipping \"revolutionary effort\" in the bud, and concludes the essay with his promise to \"explode art's [[tower of Babel]].\"<ref>Vertov 1924, p. 47</ref> In Vertov's view, \"art's tower of Babel\" was the subservience of cinematic technique to narrative, commonly known as the [[Institutional Mode of Representation]].\n\nBy this point in his career, Vertov was clearly and emphatically dissatisfied with narrative tradition, and expresses his hostility towards dramatic fiction of any kind both openly and repeatedly; he regarded drama as another \"opiate of the masses\". Vertov freely admitted one criticism leveled at his efforts on the ''Kino-Pravda'' series\u2014that the series, while influential, had a limited release.\n\nBy the end of the ''Kino-Pravda'' series, Vertov made liberal use of [[stop motion]], [[freeze frame shot|freeze frames]], and other cinematic \"artificialities,\" giving rise to criticisms not just of his trenchant dogmatism, but also of his cinematic technique. Vertov explains himself in \"On 'Kinopravda'\": in editing \"chance film clippings\" together for the Kino-Nedelia series, he \"began to doubt the necessity of a literary connection between individual visual elements spliced together.... This work served as the point of departure for 'Kinopravda.'\"<ref>Vertov 1924, p. 42</ref> Towards the end of the same essay, Vertov mentions an upcoming project which seems likely to be ''[[Man with the Movie Camera]]'' (1929), calling it an \"experimental film\" made without a scenario; just three paragraphs above, Vertov mentions a scene from ''Kino Pravda'' which should be quite familiar to viewers of ''Man with the Movie Camera'': the peasant works, and so does the urban woman, and so too, the woman film editor selecting the negative ... \"<ref>Vertov 1924, p. 46</ref>\n\n====''Man with a Movie Camera''====\n{{main|Man with a Movie Camera}}\nWith Lenin's admission of limited private enterprise through the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Russia began receiving fiction films from afar, an occurrence that Vertov regarded with undeniable suspicion, calling drama a \"corrupting influence\" on the proletarian sensibility (\"On 'Kinopravda,'\" 1924). By this time Vertov had been using his newsreel series as a pedestal to vilify dramatic fiction for several years; he continued his criticisms even after the warm reception of [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925). ''Potemkin'' was a heavily fictionalized film telling the story of a mutiny on a battleship which came about as a result of the sailors' mistreatment; the film was an obvious but skillful propaganda piece glorifying the proletariat. Vertov lost his job at [[Sovkino]] in January 1927, possibly as a result of criticizing a film which effectively preaches the line of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. He was fired for making ''A Sixth Part of the World: Advertising and the Soviet Universe'' for the State Trade Organization into a propaganda film, selling the Soviet as an advanced society under the NEP, instead of showing how they fit into the world economy. The Ukraine State Studio hired Vertov to create ''Man with a Movie Camera''.\nVertov says in his essay \"The Man with a Movie Camera\" that he was fighting \"for a decisive cleaning up of film-language, for its complete separation from the language of theater and literature.\"<ref>Vertov 1928, p. 83</ref> By the later segments of ''Kino-Pravda'', Vertov was experimenting heavily, looking to abandon what he considered film clich\u00e9s (and receiving criticism for it); his experimentation was even more pronounced and dramatic by the time of ''Man with a Movie Camera'', which was filmed in [[Ukraine]]. Some have criticized the obvious stagings in this film as being at odds with Vertov's credos of \"life as it is\" and \"life caught unawares\": the scene of the woman getting out of bed and getting dressed is obviously staged, as is the reversed shot of the chess pieces being pushed off a chess board and the tracking shot which films Mikhail Kaufman riding in a car filming a third car.\n\nHowever, Vertov's two credos, often used interchangeably, are in fact distinct, as [[Yuri Tsivian]] comments in the [[audio commentary (DVD)|commentary track]] on the DVD for ''Man with the Movie Camera:'' for Vertov, \"life as it is\" means to record life as it would be without the camera present. \"Life caught unawares\" means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera.<ref>At 16:04 on the commentary track.</ref> This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov \"life caught unawares\" meant \"life caught unaware of the camera.\" All of these shots might conform to Vertov's credo \"caught unawares.\" His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in ''Man with a Movie Camera'', two trains are shown almost melting into each other, although we are taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein's films as being different from his and his brother's in that Eisenstein, \"came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads.\" \"We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new kind of art. Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism\" Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, ''Man with a Movie Camera'', was supposed to be a way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his actions, such as the decision whether to jump or not, you can see the decision in his face, a psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.\n\n====''Cine-Eye''====\n\"Cine-Eye\" is a montage method developed by Dziga Vertov and first formulated in his work \"WE: Variant of a Manifesto\" in 1919.\n\nDziga Vertov believed his concept of ''Kino-Glaz'', or \"Cine Eye\" in English, would help contemporary \"man\" evolve from a flawed creature into a higher, more precise form. He compared man unfavorably to machines: \"In the face of the machine we are ashamed of man\u2019s inability to control himself, but what are we to do if we find the unerring ways of electricity more exciting than the disorderly haste of active people [...]\"<ref>Vertov 1922, p. 69</ref> \"I am an eye. I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, I am showing you a world, the likes of which only I can see\" Dziga was quoted as saying.\n\nLike other Russian filmmakers, he attempted to connect his ideas and techniques to the advancement of the aims of the [[Soviet Union]]. Whereas [[Sergei Eisenstein]] viewed his [[montage of attractions]] as a creative tool through which the film-viewing masses could be subjected to \"emotional and psychological influence\" and therefore able to perceive \"the ideological aspect\" of the films they were watching, Vertov believed the [[Kinoks|Cine-Eye]] would influence the actual evolution of man, \"from a bumbling citizen through the poetry of the machine to the perfect electric man.\"<ref>Vertov 1922, pp. 69-71</ref>\n\nVertov surrounded himself with others that were also firm believers in his ideas. These were the Kinoks, other Russian filmmakers that would assist him in his hopes of making \"cine-eye\" a success.\n\nVertov believed film was too \"romantic\" and \"theatricalised\" due to the influence of literature, theater, and music and that these psychological film-dramas \"prevent man from being as precise as a stopwatch and hamper his desire for kinship with the machine.\" He desired to move away from \"the pre-Revolutionary \u2018fictional\u2019 models\" of filmmaking to one based on the rhythm of machines, seeking to \"bring creative joy to all mechanical labour\"<ref name = \"Vertov 1922, p. 71\">Vertov 1922, p. 71</ref> and to \"bring men closer to machines.\"<ref name = \"Vertov 1922, p. 71\" />\n\n===Late career===\nVertov's successful career continued into the 1930s. ''Enthusiasm: Symphony of the [[Donbass]]'' (1931), an examination into Soviet miners. ''Enthusiasm'' has been called a 'sound film', with sound recorded on location, and these mechanical sounds woven together, producing a symphony-like effect.\n\nThree years later, ''Three Songs about Lenin'' (1934) looked at the revolution through the eyes of the Russian peasantry. For his film, however, Vertov had been hired by [[Gorky Film Studio|Mezhrabpomfilm]], a Soviet studio that produced mainly propaganda efforts. The film, finished in January 1934 for Lenin's obit, was only publicly released in November of that year. A new version of the film was released  in 1938, including a longer sequence to reflect Stalin's \"achievements\" at the end of the film and leaving out footage with \"enemies\" of that time. Today there exists a 1970 reconstruction by [[Elizaveta Svilova]]. With the rise and official sanction of [[socialist realism]] in 1934, Vertov was forced to cut his personal artistic output significantly, eventually becoming little more than an editor for Soviet newsreels.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}  ''Lullaby'', perhaps the last film in which Vertov was able to maintain his artistic vision, was released in 1937.Dziga Vertov died of cancer in Moscow in 1954.\n\n==Family==\nVertov's brother [[Boris Kaufman]] was a cinematographer who worked with [[Jean Vigo]] on ''[[L'Atalante]]'' (1934) and much later for directors such as [[Elia Kazan]] in the United States. (He won an Oscar for his work on ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.) His other brother, [[Mikhail Kaufman]], worked as Vertov's cinematographer until he became a documentarian in his own right. Mikhail Kaufman's directorial debut was the film ''[[In Spring (1929 film)|In Spring]]'' (1929). In September 1929, Vertov married his long-time collaborator [[Elizaveta Svilova]].\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nVertov's legacy still lives on today. His ideas are echoed in [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]], the movement of the 1960s named after Vertov's ''Kino-Pravda''. The 1960s and 1970s saw an international revival of interest in Vertov.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Ve-Y/Vertov-Dziga.html|title=Dziga Vertov, by Erik Barnouw}}</ref>\n\nThe independent, exploratory style of Vertov influenced and inspired many filmmakers and directors like the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]] and independent companies such as \"Vertov Industries,\" in Hawaii. The [[Dziga Vertov Group]] borrowed his name. In 1960, [[Jean Rouch]] used Vertov's filming theory when making ''Chronicle of a Summer''. His partner [[Edgar Morin]] coined ''Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9'' term when describing the style, using direct translation of Vertov\u2019s ''KinoPravda''.\n\nThe [[Free Cinema]] movement in the United Kingdom during the 1950s, the [[Direct Cinema]] in North America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the ''[[Candid Eye]]'' series in Canada in the 1950s, all essentially owed a debt to Vertov.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFszBZIqf40C&pg=PA324|title=The technique of film and video editing: history, theory, and practice, by Ken Dancyger}}</ref>\n\nThis revival of Vertov's legacy included rehabilitation of his reputation in the Soviet Union, with retrospectives of his films, biographical works and writings. In 1962, the first Soviet monograph on Vertov was published, followed by another collection, 'Dziga Vertov: Articles, Diaries, Projects.' To recall the 30th anniversary of Vertov's death, three New York cultural organizations put on the first American retrospective of Vertov's work.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqcYAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA552&lpg=PA552&dq=American+retrospective+of+Vertov'&source=bl&ots=elT7QwxWvM&sig=wNT1x-E9Ufmw30_pMdzk8Wm6W9M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4ttjcqIXZAhXEslkKHSweDGwQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&q=American%20retrospective%20of%20Vertov'&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Film|last=Monaco|first=James|date=1991|publisher=Perigee Books|isbn=9780399516047|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[New Media]] theorist [[Lev Manovich]] suggested Vertov as one of the early pioneers of [[database cinema]] genre in his essay ''Database as a symbolic form''.\n\n==Filmography==\n[[File:Kino glaz.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''Kino-Glaz'', designed by [[Alexander Rodchenko]] (1924)]]\n[[File:Soviet Toys (1924).webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Soviet Toys'']]\n*1919 \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f (''Kino Nedelya''/''Cinema Week'')\n*1919 \u0413\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u0438 (''Anniversary of the Revolution'')\n*1922 \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b (''History of the Civil War'')\n*1924 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 (''Soviet Toys'')\n*1924 \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437 (''Kino-Glaz''/''[[Cinema Eye]]'') cameraman [[Ilya Kopalin]]\n*1925 \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 (''[[Kino-Pravda]]'')\n*1926 \u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 (''[[A Sixth Part of the World]]'')\n*1928 \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 (''The Eleventh Year'')\n*1929 \u0427\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0441 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c (''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'')\n*1930 \u042d\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0437\u043c (\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0430) (''[[Enthusiasm (film)|Enthusiasm]]'')\n*1934 \u0422\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u043e \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0435 (''[[Three Songs About Lenin]]'')\n*1937 \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0435 (''[[In Memory of Sergo Ordzhonikidze (1937 film)|In Memory of Sergo Ordzhonikidze]]'')\n*1937 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f (''[[Lullaby (1937 film)|Lullaby]]'')\n*1938 \u0422\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0438 (''Three Heroines'')\n*1942 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u2014 \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443!

It has been the most important jurisdiction in [[United States corporate law]] since the early 20th century. Over 50% of [[Public company|publicly traded]] corporations in the United States and 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title=About Agency |publisher=Delaware Division of Corporations}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Regulatory competition|Race to the bottom}}\nDelaware acquired its status as a corporate haven in the early 20th century. Following the example of [[New Jersey]], which enacted corporate-friendly laws at the end of the 19th century to attract businesses<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cary|first1=William L.|title=Cases and Materials on Corporations|date=1969|publisher=The Foundation Press, Inc.|location=Mineola|page=9}}</ref> from [[New York (state)|New York]], Delaware adopted on March 10, 1899, a general incorporation act aimed at attracting more businesses. The group that pushed for this legislation intended to establish a corporation that would sell services to other businesses incorporating in Delaware.<ref>[http://www.djcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-History-of-Delaware-Corporation-Law1.pdf A History of Delaware Corporation Law], S. Samuel Arsht, ''Delaware Journal of Corporate Law'', 1976, pg. 6.</ref> Before the rise of general incorporation acts, forming a corporation required a special act of the state legislature. General incorporation allowed anyone to form a corporation by simply raising money and filing articles of incorporation with the state's Secretary of State.\n\n==Other legal aspects==\nBecause of the extensive experience of the Delaware courts, Delaware has a more well-developed body of case law than other states,<ref>https://www.economist.com/business/2013/11/23/a-new-judicial-boss</ref> which serves to give corporations and their counsel greater guidance on matters of corporate governance and transaction liability issues. Disputes over the internal affairs of Delaware corporations are usually filed in the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]], which is a separate court of [[Equity (law)|equity]], as opposed to a [[court of law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courts.delaware.gov/overview.stm |title=Overview of the Delaware Court System |publisher=Delaware State Courts}}</ref> Because it is a court of equity, there are no juries; its cases are heard by judges, called chancellors. Since 1989, the court has consisted of one Chancellor and four Vice Chancellors. The court is a trial court, with one chancellor hearing each case. Litigants may appeal final decisions of the Court of Chancery to the [[Delaware Supreme Court]].\n\nDelaware has also attracted major credit card banks because of its relaxed rules regarding [[interest]]. Many U.S. states have [[usury]] laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge. Federal law allows a national bank to \"import\" these laws from the state in which its principal office is located.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.occ.gov/static/interpretations-and-precedents/mar98/int822.pdf |title=Interpretive Letter #822 |work=Interpretations and Actions |publisher=[[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] |volume=11 |number=3 |date=March 1998}}</ref> Delaware (amongst others) has relatively relaxed interest laws,<ref name=\"USA_Corp\">{{cite book|last1=Usa Ibp Usa|title=Us Company Laws and Regulations Handbook Volume 2 Delaware|date=2009|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=1433070820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWI__tnGDJ0C&lpg=PA48&ots=HX6cP5_YhT&dq=delaware%20relaxed%20interest%20laws&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q=delaware%20relaxed%20interest%20laws&f=false}}</ref> so several national banks have decided to locate their principal office in Delaware.

When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, the Detroit River became notoriously [[water pollution|polluted]] and toxic. Since the late 20th century, however, a vast restoration effort has been undertaken because of the ecological importance of the river. \n\nIn the early 21st century, the river today has a wide variety of economic and recreational uses.

At its source, the river is at an elevation of {{convert|574|ft}} above sea level. The river drops only three feet before entering into Lake Erie at {{convert|571|ft}}. As the river contains no [[dam]]s and no [[lock (water transport)|locks]], it is easily [[Navigability|navigable]] by even the smallest of vessels. The [[Drainage basin|watershed basin]] for the Detroit River is approximately {{convert|700|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=EPA/> Since the river is fairly short, it has few tributaries.

The river on the American side is all under the jurisdiction of [[Wayne County, Michigan]], and the Canadian side is under the administration of [[Essex County, Ontario]]. The largest city along the Detroit River is [[Detroit]], and most of the population along the river lives in [[Michigan]]. The Detroit River has only two automobile traffic crossings connecting the United States and Canada: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel]]. Both of these are strongly protected by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]].\n\nThe upper portion of the river is one of the few places where a Canadian city lies directly south of an American city. In this case, the city of [[Detroit]] is directly north of the city of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The only other location where this occurs is [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], lying south of several cities in [[Niagara County, New York]]. The cities and communities southwest of Detroit along the American side of the river are popularly referred to as the [[Downriver]] area, because those areas are said to be \"down the river\" from Detroit. Several of these communities do not border the Detroit River; the term \"Downriver\" refers broadly to a cluster of 18 suburban communities that lie to the southwest of the city of Detroit and to the west of the Detroit River.\n\n===Islands===\n{{Main|List of islands in the Detroit River}}\nThe Detroit River contains numerous islands, whose ownership and control varies depending on their location along the river. The majority are on the American side of the river; none is divided by the international border. Many are very small and uninhabited. But, [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse \u00cele]] on the U.S. side and [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bois Blanc (Boblo) Island]] on the Canadian side have permanent populations.

The [[Iroquois]] traded [[Fur clothing|furs]] with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonists]] at [[New Amsterdam]] by traveling through the Detroit River.<ref name=detnews/> The [[French colonial empire|French]] later claimed the area for [[New France]]. The famed sailing ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' reached the mouth of the Detroit River in mid-August 1679 on its maiden voyage through the Great Lakes.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ken |last=VanEseltine |url=http://my.net-link.net/~vaneselk/ussgryphon/name.htm |date=26 August 2008 |title=''Le Griffon'' is a Meaningful Name |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Later, when the French began settling in the area, they navigated the river using [[canoe]]s made of [[birch]] or [[elm]] bark. Handcrafted vessels were a common mode of travel across the river, and the [[pirogue]] and [[bateaux]] were also used. As the [[North American fur trade]] intensified, European settlers began expanding their trade westward into the uncharted territories. French explorer [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]] sailed up the Detroit River on July 23, 1701. The next day, he established [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit]], which developed as Detroit.<ref>{{Cite web|first=T. |last=Granzo |url=http://www.historydetroit.com/people/antoine_cadillac.asp |year=2008 |title=History of Detroit: Antoine de la Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The French named the river as ''Rivi\u00e8re D\u00e9troit''.  ''D\u00e9troit'' is [[French language|French]] for \"[[strait]]\". The river was known literally as the \"River of the Strait\".\n\n[[File:DetroitRiverlaker.jpg|thumb|As one of the most important waterways in the world, large [[cargo ship|freighters]] are a common sight on the Detroit River.]]\n\nThe Detroit River\u200a\u2014\u200aand the larger area surrounding it\u200a\u2014\u200awas taken from the French by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. It was claimed by the newly formed [[United States]] during the [[American Revolution]] but was not turned over by the British until 1796. During the [[War of 1812]], the Detroit River served as a major barrier between the American [[Michigan Territory]] and British [[Upper Canada]], especially during the [[Siege of Detroit|Battle of Fort Detroit]] in August 1812, when Detroit briefly fell to the British.<ref>{{Cite web| first=J. |last=Rickard|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_detroit.html |date=21 November 2007 |title=Battle of Detroit, 16 August 1812 |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1817, which opened up easier travel to Lake Erie from the [[East Coast of the United States]], the Detroit River became a heavily traversed route for settlers traveling to northern Michigan, and Detroit, as well, experienced a sudden increase in population. Following the [[Patriot War]] which nearly saw a battle between British regulars and Michigan militia on the ice-covered Detroit River, [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]] was constructed at Detroit to counter Britain's riverside [[Fort Malden]] at Amherstburg. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] feared that the seceded [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) would plan a northerly attack from Canada, which was still owned by the British Empire and remained neutral in the war. The Union feared that the CSA would cross the Detroit River to launch this attack. For that reason, the Detroit River was heavily patrolled and the fortification at Fort Wayne improved, even though it was far removed from any real combat. While no major attack came from Canada, a plot to capture the U.S. Navy warship, [[USS Michigan (1843)|USS ''Michigan'']] and liberate Confederate prisoners from [[USS Michigan (1843)#American Civil War|Johnson Island]], in western Lake Erie, was narrowly averted only after the Confederates had captured two passenger steamships.<ref name=detnews/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/w/wolverine-i.html |title=''Wolverine'' |author=Naval History And Heritage Command |date= |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=Naval History And Heritage Command |accessdate=25 January 2015 |ref={{sfnref|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Wolverine''}}}}</ref> At the beginning of the 20th century, Detroit's industrialization took off on an unprecedented scale. The Detroit River became the busiest commercial river in the world and was dubbed \"the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth\" by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1908. In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67,292,504 tons (61 billion kg) of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world. For comparison, [[London]] shipped 18,727,230 tons (16 billion kg), and [[New York City|New York]] shipped 20,390,953 tons (18 billion kg).<ref name=detnews/>\n\n===Prohibition===\nFrom 1920 to 1933 there was [[Prohibition in the United States]], and the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] for consumption were nationally banned. Detroit, as the largest city bordering Canada, where alcohol remained legal during Prohibition, became the center of a new industry known as [[rum-running]].\n\nThere were no bridges in the area connecting Canada and the United States until the [[Ambassador Bridge]] was finished in 1929 and the [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel]] in 1930 so boats were used to smuggle alcohol across the river during the summer, and during the winter months, rum-runners traveled across the frozen Detroit River by car to Canada and back with trunk loads of alcohol. In some cases, overloaded cars fell through the ice, and today, car parts from this illegal era can still be seen on the bottom of the river.{{cn|date=August 2017}} [[Rum-running in Windsor]] became a very common practice, and led to the rise of mobsters such as [[the Purple Gang]], who used violence as a means to control the route known as the \"Detroit-Windsor Funnel\"\u200a\u2014\u200aparodying the newly built tunnel.<ref>{{Cite web| first=Mark |last=Gribben |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/purple/1.html |year=2008 |title=The Purple Gang: Bootlegger's Paradise |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The Detroit River, [[Lake St. Clair]], and the [[St. Clair River]] are estimated to have carried 75% of all liquor smuggled into the United States during Prohibition.

This has resulted in excessive [[water pollution]] from the unregulated dumping of chemicals and industrial waste for many decades. Much of the garbage and sewage from Detroit's rapid industrialization found its way into the river. Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were heavily polluted and unsafe for recreational use. Large quantities of this pollution collected around the mouth of the Detroit River at [[Lake Erie]]. The pollutants were so high after the spring thaw that thousands of migrating birds were killed by oil slicks and contaminated water every year. Oxygen levels in the river were depleted to the point where fish were unable to inhabit its waters. Because much of this pollution drained into and affected Lake Erie, the lake itself was considered \"dead\" and unable to support aquatic life.<ref name=hartig>{{Cite web| first=John |last=Hartig |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/hunting/columns/story?columnist=swan_james&page=g_col_swan_det_river |date=17 July 2007|title=The Detroit River's amazing comeback |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=swan>{{Cite web |first=James |last=Swan |url=http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |date=19 March 2009 |title=Return of the Detroit River\u2019s Charismatic Megafauna |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922140030/http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was founded by congressional order. That paved the way for tighter restrictions on industries and allocated substantial amounts of government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the entire [[fishing industry]] in the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]], the Detroit River, and Lake Erie had to be closed due to toxic levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] found in the water. This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River.<ref name=hartig/> For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multimillion-dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river. In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river.<ref name=swan/> In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]], which is a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. Millions of dollars so far have been used to dredge pollutants out of the river, and the recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand.<ref name=hartig/> Today, many species of native animals are returning to the area after being driven out by human development. The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as [[eagle]]s (including reintroduced [[bald eagle]]s), [[osprey]]s, and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Fish species in abundance in the area include [[lake whitefish]], [[sturgeon]], [[silver bass]], [[black bass]], [[salmon]], [[perch]], and [[walleye]].<ref name=swan/> The Detroit River was designated as an [[American Heritage Rivers|American Heritage River]] in 1998<ref name=AHRS>{{Cite web |last=[[American Heritage Rivers]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/rivers/98rivers/detroit.html |date=19 October 2006 |title=Detroit River (MI): An American Heritage Designated River |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722101841/http://www.epa.gov/rivers/98rivers/detroit.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref> and a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian Heritage River]] in 2001<ref name=CHRS>{{Cite web |last=[[Canadian Heritage Rivers System]] |url=http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Detroit/Detroit_e.htm |title=Detroit River, Ontario: A Unique International Heritage |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802233729/http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Detroit/Detroit_e.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\u200a\u2014\u200athe only river to have dual designations.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Economy of metropolitan Detroit}}\n[[File:Detroit GM headquarters.jpg|thumb|The [[Renaissance Center]], located in [[downtown Detroit]], is one of the most recognizable features along the shores of the Detroit River.]]\n\nThe Detroit River is used for shipping and trading. The earliest use of the river for such economic activities was the shipping of furs for trade as early as the 17th century.<ref name=detnews/> When the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] decreased, Michigan had already begun to exploit the [[lumber]]-rich areas of Northern Michigan and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Detroit turned into a major industrial region, largely because of the Detroit River. The only way a ship could travel out of the upper Great Lakes system was to travel down the Detroit River. From there, ships could travel anywhere in the world out of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] or the [[Erie Canal]] to [[New York City]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the automotive industry boomed, and the many manufacturers shipped in abundant supplies of [[iron ore]], sand, limestone and wood.\n\nFirst hand, the Detroit River provides a substantial amount of revenue for the local economies. A study in 1991 showed that $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. During the same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed an additional $192.8 million to Michigan\u2019s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and fishing licenses. It is estimated that walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring.<ref>{{Cite web|last=International Association for Great Lakes Research |url=http://www.iaglr.org/scipolicy/issues/detroithabitat.php |title=Conserving Detroit River Habitats|year= 2009|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> Other fish caught by recreational fisherman include [[white bass]], [[bluegill]], [[crappie]], [[freshwater drum]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[northern pike]] and [[Muskellunge|muskie]]. There are over 800,000 recreation boats in the state of Michigan, and more than half of those are regularly used on or near the Detroit River. A percentage of the tourist revenue depends on the Detroit River, which is the most noticeable environmental feature in Detroit. Popular river destinations in the city of Detroit include the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] and [[Belle Isle Park]]\u200a\u2014\u200aboth of which host a number of events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have dock facilities for boaters.

In 2004, the total American trade with Ontario alone was $407 billion, in which 28% ($113.3 billion) crossed the Detroit River.\n\nThe only two automobile traffic routes that completely cross the river are the privately owned [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]], both of which connect Detroit, Michigan to Windsor, Ontario. A railway tunnel and a commercial truck ferry service also travel between Detroit and Windsor. In Michigan, there are two bridges connecting the mainland to [[Grosse Ile Township, Michigan|Grosse Ile]] and the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]], popularly known as the \"Belle Isle Bridge,\" that connects the City of Detroit to [[Belle Isle Park]]. All crossings (ports of entry) on the American side are secured by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]'s Office of Field Operations and on the Canadian side by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]]; all areas between the American ports of entry and on the American side of the river are secured by the [[United States Border Patrol]].\n\nProposals have been made to create a [[Detroit River International Crossing|third crossing]] to connect Detroit and Windsor.

The suspected burglar, a 16-year-old named Genaro Samano Villanueva, had been living in San Diego with family members for approximately five months. He had dropped out of high school but re-enrolled and was due to return to school on February 27. Earlier that morning, Villanueva was taken into custody by police after attempting to steal a radio from a car near his home on India Street. Police released Villanueva into the custody of the vice principal of his high school and told him to return to class. Instead, Villanueva left school and went to [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] where he was spotted by Canadian tourist Jack Beamer. Beamer, his wife and another couple were visiting San Diego and staying in motor homes at the park. Beamer saw Villanueva prowling around inside his friends' motor home and yelled at him causing Villanueva to flee the scene.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-14/local/me-26611_1_san-diego-police|title=Huffman's Slaying: Strangers Cross Paths and Tragedy Strikes|last1=Harris|first1=Scott|last2=Reza|first2=H.G.|date=March 14, 1985|publisher=latimes.com|pages=1\u20132|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death, David Huffman was appearing in the play ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' at the [[Old Globe Theatre]]. He had visited the theatre shortly before noon to share cookies with the cast and crew.<ref name=\"Damsker\"/> Huffman was sitting in his van near the theatre playing his bagpipes when he saw Beamer yell at Villanueva. He then gave chase in his vehicle before parking the van near the [[Spreckels Organ Pavilion]] and following Villanueva into the park. Huffman eventually caught up with the suspect and the two got into a physical altercation during which Villanueva stabbed Huffman twice in the chest with a screwdriver. Huffman died of [[exsanguination]] in 30 to 45 seconds.<ref name=latimes/> Huffman's body was found at 1:09 pm. less than an hour later in a crevice  in Palm Canyon by a group of children visiting the park on a field trip. As he was not carrying identification at the time of his death, Huffman's body was not positively identified until later that night.<ref name=\"Damsker\"/> Police initially had no leads and on March 2 and 3, [[Crime Stoppers]] produced a reenactment of the crime.

Although Poland is not mentioned by name, it refers to ''Dagome'' and ''Ote'' ([[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] and his wife, [[Oda von Haldensleben]]) and their sons in 991, placing their land (called \"Schinesghe\") under the protection of the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]]. The document's name derives from its opening words.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}The ''Dagome iudex'' survives in the form of a summary, completed c. 1080. It was found in a register compiled by a [[Roman Curia|curial]] [[Catholic Cardinal|cardinal]] during the [[Pope|papacy]] of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]].\n\nMost historians believe that the word ''\"Dagome\"'' is a melding of two names: the Christian ''\"Dago,\"'' for \"[[Dagobert]]\" (Mieszko's hypothetical baptismal name), and the Slavic ''\"Me,\"'' for \"Mieszko.\" The [[Latin]] word ''\"iudex\"'' (\"judge\") could refer to \"prince.\" Another interpretation is that ''\"Dagome iudex\"'' is a corruption of ''\"Ego Mesco dux\"'' (\"I, Prince Mieszko\"). In the Vatican copy, the e of Dagome might have an ''s adscriptum'' (similar to [[cedilla]]), although the Vatican copyist read ''iudex'' literally, relating it to [[Sardinia]] and [[Giudicati|its four \"judges\"]].\n\nPlace names are misspelled by the writer who made the summary. He was apparently unaware that the document related to territory later called Poland.\n\nThe boundaries of the \"[[Gniezno]]\" state are described as those that extended to the \"Long Sea\" (the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]), [[Prussia]], [[Rus' people|Rus']], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Moravia]] and the [[Oder River]]. [[Lesser Poland]] is included by the mention of its capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]] (\"craccoa\"). Between ''alemura'', probably [[Olomouc]] and [[Upper Lusatia]] region of the [[Milceni]] (''terra mileze'') <ref>When Lusatia came in sight of medieval writers, the {{ill|Lusici (tribe)|de|Lusitzi|lt=Lusici}} lived only in [[Lower Lusatia]], the [[Milceni]] in [[Upper Lusatia]]. Later on, the term ''Lusatia'' (Lausitz, Lu\u017eice) was spread to the south. Therefore, nowaday's term [[Lusatian Mountains]] does not totally fit with the history of settlement.</ref> a straightened border could include [[Silesia]].\n\nThe text seems to use ''ciuitas schinesghe'' as a synonym of [[Greater Poland]]. Otherwise, the boundary description would be more logical if ''schenisghe'' meant the city of [[Szczecin]]. Of the other regions and places in Mieszko's territory, it mentioned only [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Lusatia]], both without ''fines'' (border). The regions outside Mieszko's rule, ''pruzze'' ([[Prussia]]) and ''russe'' ([[Ruthenia]]) were mentioned with the word ''fines''.\n\nThe ''Dagome iudex'' is of critical importance to [[History of Poland|Polish history]], since it provided a general description of the future Polish state in that period. It, however, left many questions unanswered. First, it did not explain ''why'' [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] placed his state under the Pope's protection. Also, it is unclear why the document did not mention Mieszko's eldest son, [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]]. Instead, his sons by his second wife (except the third), Oda, were mentioned instead. Finally, Mieszko I is not referred to as \"''Dagome''\" in any other document.\n\nHistorians suppose that Boles\u0142aw's absence from the document might be explained by an old Slavic custom whereby children received their inheritance as soon as they reached the [[age of majority]]. Thus, [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw the Brave]] might have received [[Krak\u00f3w]] as his part of his father's legacy before the ''Dagome iudex'' was written.\n\n== Text of the ''Dagome iudex'' ==\n\n* In Latin:\n\n: ''Item in alio tomo sub Iohanne XV papa Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum: Misicam et Lambertus - nescio cuius gentis homines, puto autem Sardos fuisse, quoniam ipsi a IIII iudicibus reguntur - leguntur beato Petro contulisse unam civitatem in integro, que vocatur Schinesghe, cum omnibus suis pertinentiis infra hos affines, sicuti incipit a primo latere longum mare, fine Bruzze usque in locum, qui dicitur Russe et fines Russe extendente usque in Craccoa et ab ipsa Craccoa usque ad flumen Oddere recte in locum, qui dicitur Alemure, et ab ipsa Alemura usque in terram Milze recte intra Oddere et exinde ducente iuxta flumen Oddera usque in predictam civitatem Schinesghe.''\n\n* In English translation:\n\n: \"Also in another volume from the times of [[Pope John XV]], Dagome,<ref>\"Dagome\" is commonly identified as [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]. However, the question remains open whether this was a misspelling or his Christian name. If the latter, it might correspond to the names \"[[Dago (name)|Dago]]\", \"[[Dagon]]\" or \"[[Dagobert]]\".</ref> lord,<ref>In classical Latin, the term ''iudex'' was used to refer to \"a person who is ordered to do some work on behalf of others\" and was identical in meaning to the Byzantine ''[[archont]]''. However, in medieval Latin ''iudex'' could also mean a sovereign ruler. Princes of [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes were sometimes referred to as ''iudices''.  Nevertheless,  some historians claim that this was a misspelling of the Latin ''[[dux]]'' (\"duke\" or \"prince\").</ref> and [[Oda von Haldensleben|Ote]], lady,<ref>Literally, \"lady-senator\".  Cf. \"[[senate]]\".</ref> and their sons [[Mieszko Mieszkowic|Misico]] and [[Lambert Mieszkowic|Lambert]]<ref>It is unclear why [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], Mieszko's eldest son and his successor, is not mentioned while the children from Mieszko's marriage to Ote are.</ref> (I do not know of which nation those people are, but I think they are [[Sardinian people|Sardinians]], for those are ruled by four judges<ref>Scribe's note, only in the Vatican copy; the four is written non-classical as iiii.</ref>) were supposed to give to Saint Peter one state in whole which is called Schinesghe,<ref>The origin of the name ''Schinesghe'' is unclear.

Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=72B3hZjp_LoC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=derek+walcott+paradoxes+postcolonial#v=onepage&q=derek%20walcott%20paradoxes%20postcolonial&f=false|title=Postcolonial Paradoxes in French Caribbean Writing: C\u00e9saire, Glissant, Cond\u00e9|last=Suk|first=Jeannie|date=17 May 2001|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780191584404|language=en}}</ref> Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nidhi|first=Mahajan,|date=1 January 2015|title=Cultural Tensions and Hybrid Identities in Derek Walcott's Poetry|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1141/cultural-tensions-and-hybrid-identities-in-derek-walcotts-poetry|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=7|issue=9}}</ref>\n\n===Essays===\nIn his 1970 essay \"What the Twilight Says: An Overture\", discussing art and theatre in his native region (from ''Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays''), Walcott reflects on the West Indies as colonized space.  He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: \"We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another\". The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ''Ti-Jean and his Brothers''. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walcott: Caribbean literary colossus |url=http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/02/25/walcott-caribbean-literary-colossus/|location=St Michael, Barbados |accessdate=19 March 2017|work=Barbados Today|date=25 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWalcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture\n\n<blockquote>What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done\u2014by a [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], a [[Dickens]], a [[Henry Handel Richardson|Richardson]].<ref name=\"Paris Review\" /></blockquote>\n\nWalcott identified as \"absolutely a Caribbean writer\", a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage.<ref name=\"Paris Review\" /> In such poems as \"The Castaway\" (1965) and in the play ''[[Pantomime (Walcott play)|Pantomime]]'' (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes, \"If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by.\"<ref name=\"Paris Review\" />\n\n===''Omeros''===\nWalcott's epic book-length poem ''[[Omeros]]'' was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references [[Homer]] and some of his major characters from ''[[The Iliad]]''. Some of the poem's major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/walcott-omeros.html|title=Bringing Him Back Alive|last=Lefkowitz|first=Mary|date=7 October 1990|website=The New York Times|access-date=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem's composition), and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including [[Lisbon]], London, [[Dublin]], Rome, and Toronto.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James V.|date=1 January 1999|title=Homer Travels to the Caribbean: Teaching Walcott's \"Omeros\"|jstor=4352373|journal=The Classical World|volume=93|issue=1|pages=83\u201399|doi=10.2307/4352373}}</ref>\n \nComposed in a variation on ''[[terza rima]]'', the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcott's oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world.<ref name=\"Bixby\">Patrick Bixby, [http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Walcott.html \"Derek Walcott\"], essay: Spring 2000, [[Emory University]]. Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize in Literature===\n\nDerek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992, two years after publishing the epic poem \"Omeros.\" He was known for writing about \"the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds.\" His poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the English language and his sense of his own people.<ref>Grimes, William. \"Derek Walcott, Poet and Nobel Laureate of the Caribbean, Dies at 87.\" The New York Times, ''The New York Times'', 17 March 2017, www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/books/derek-walcott-dead-nobel-prize-literature.html.</ref>\n\nStephen Breslow explained that he and the Swedish Academy chose Derek Walcott for the Nobel Laureate in Literature because his work had \"a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality, through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication.\" It was Walcott's ability to be more than just \"exotic\" that brought his work critical attention. Breslow explains that \"Walcott has merged a profound, rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace \u2013 its people, its landscape, and its history \u2013 with the central, classical tradition of Western civilization.\" This ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the Swedish Academy. Walcott's works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works.<ref>Breslow, Stephen. \"Derek Walcott: 1992 Nobel Laureate in Literature.\" World Literature Today, vol. 67, no. 2, 1993, pp. 267\u2013271., doi:10.2307/40149065.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/40149065  </ref>\n\nIn his Nobel acceptance speech, Walcott describes life on Antilles and what it means to discover identity. He describes all of the \"broken fragments\" of his \"diasporic\" identity. People need books, he says, but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is. Walcott says that \"the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. [is] Survival\" because \"all of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog.\" He encompasses the diasporic identity found in Caribbean Literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot, alone, fully bring together a cultural identity.<ref> \"Derek Walcott \u2013 Nobel Lecture: The Antilles: Fragments of Epic Memory\".

Web. http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/walcott-lecture.html </ref>\n\n===Criticism and praise===\nWalcott's work has received praise from major poets including [[Robert Graves]], who wrote that Walcott \"handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries\",<ref>Robert D. Hamner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CkNTOawGMjwC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=&source=bl&ots=t6XBMMi0rR&sig=b1kkPUT2Dxvp3yj5E75Xm8qmjFg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6ZpJVLeLF8P3apG4gOAH&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&q=handles%20English&f=false \"Introduction\"], ''Critical Perspectives on Derek Walcott'' (Three Continents, 1993), Lynne Rienner, 1997, p. 1.</ref> and [[Joseph Brodsky]], who praised Walcott's work, writing: \"For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or 'a world'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/220|title=Derek Walcott|work=''poets.org''}}</ref> Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]], who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets \"outside the American experience\".\n\nThe poetry critic [[William Logan (poet)|William Logan]] critiqued Walcott's work in a ''New York Times'' book review of Walcott's ''Selected Poems''. While he praised Walcott's writing in ''Sea Grapes'' and ''The Arkansas Testament'', Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcott's poetry, calling ''Omeros'' \"clumsy\" and ''Another Life'' \"pretentious.\" Finally, he concluded with the faint praise that \"No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Logan.t.html|first1=William|last1=Logan|title=The Poet of Exile|date=8 April 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMost reviews of Walcott's work are more positive. For instance, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of ''The Poetry of Derek Walcott'', [[Adam Kirsch]] had high praise for Walcott's oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:\n\n<blockquote>By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott\u2019s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.<ref>Kirsch, Adam. [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/full-fathom-five-2 \"Full Fathom Five\"], ''The New Yorker'', 3 February 2014.</ref></blockquote>\n\nKirsch calls ''Another Life'' Walcott's \"first major peak\" and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott's imagery from his earliest work through to later books like ''Tiepolo's Hound''. He also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott's work, calling him \"the postcolonial writer par excellence.\" He calls the early poem \"A Far Cry from Africa\" a turning point in Walcott's development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of ''Omeros'' which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although ''Omeros'' is the volume of Walcott's that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes that ''Midsummer'' is his best book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/full-fathom-five-2|title=Full Fathom Five|last=Kirsch|first=Adam|date=3 February 2014|website=The New Yorker|access-date=18 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis poetry, as spoken performance, appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group [[Dreadzone]]. Their track entitled 'Captain Dread' from the album '[[Second Light]]' incorporates the fourth verse of Walcott's 1990 poem 'The Schooner Flight'.\n\nIn 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released \"Poetry is an Island\", a feature documentary film about Derek Walcott's life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of [[St Lucia]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Dee Lundy|title=It's Past Time For Walcott's Poetry Island|url=http://stluciastar.com/its-past-time-for-walcotts-poetry-island/|accessdate=11 April 2017|work=St Lucia Star|date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=El Gammal-Ortiz|first1=Sharif|title=Film: Review Of \"Poetry Is An Island\"|url=https://repeatingislands.com/2015/08/13/film-review-of-poetry-is-an-island/|accessdate=11 April 2017|work=Repeating Islands|date=13 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1959. They had a son, the St Lucian painter Peter Walcott.

In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier (divorced in 1993).

Not shown is the much larger receiver unit.]]\nThe '''Decca Navigator System''' was a [[hyperbolic navigation|hyperbolic]] [[radio navigation]] system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used phase comparison of [[low frequency|low frequencies]] from 70 to 129 [[kilohertz|kHz]], as opposed to pulse timing systems like [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] and [[LORAN]]. This made it much easier to implement the receivers using 1940s electronics.\n\nThe system was invented in the US, but development was carried out by [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the UK. It was first deployed by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings and was not known to the Germans and thus free of jamming. After the war it was extensively developed around the UK and later used in many areas around the world. Decca's primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters, offering much better accuracy than the competing LORAN system. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of [[moving map display]]s. The system was deployed extensively in the [[North Sea]] and was used by helicopters operating to [[oil platform]]s.\n\nThe opening of the more accurate [[Loran-C]] system to civilian use in 1974 offered stiff competition, but Decca was well established by this time and continued operations into the 1990s. Decca was eventually replaced, along with Loran and other similar systems, by the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] during the 1990s. The Decca system in Europe was shut down in the spring of 2000, and the last worldwide chain, in Japan, in 2001.\n\n== Principles of Operation ==\n=== Overview ===\n[[Image:Crude loran diagram.PNG|thumb|right|''The Decca Navigator principle.'' <br> The phase difference between the signals received from stations A (Master) and B (Slave) is constant along each hyperbolic curve. The foci of the hyperbola are at the transmitting stations, A and B.]]\n\nThe Decca Navigator System consisted of a number of land-based radio beacons organised into ''chains''. Each chain consisted of a [[master station]] and three (occasionally two) secondary stations, termed Red, Green and Purple. Ideally, the secondaries would be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the master at the centre. The baseline length, that is, the master-secondary distance, was typically {{convert|60-120|nmi|km}}.\n\nEach station transmitted a continuous wave signal that, by comparing the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference of the signals from the master and one of the secondaries, resulted in a set of hyperbolic ''[[lines of position]]'' called a ''pattern''. As there were three secondaries there were three patterns, termed Red, Green and Purple. The patterns were drawn on nautical charts as a set of hyperbolic lines in the appropriate colour. Receivers identified which [[hyperbola]] they were on and a position could be plotted at the intersection of the [[hyperbola]] from different patterns, usually by using the pair with the angle of cut closest to orthogonal as possible.\n\n=== Detailed Principles of Operation ===\nWhen two stations transmit at the  [[phase-locked loop|phase-locked frequency]], the difference in phase between the two signals is constant along a hyperbolic path. Of course, if two stations transmit on the same frequency, it is practically impossible for the receiver to separate them; so instead of all stations transmitting at the same frequency, each chain was allocated a nominal frequency, 1f, and each station in the chain transmitted at a harmonic of this base frequency, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Station!! Harmonic !! Frequency (kHz)\n|-\n| Master || 6f || 85.000\n|-\n| Purple || 5f || 70.833\n|-\n| Red || 8f || 113.333\n|-\n| Green || 9f || 127.500\n|}\n\nThe frequencies given are those for Chain 5B, known as the English Chain, but all chains used similar frequencies between 70&nbsp;kHz and 129&nbsp;kHz.\n\nDecca receivers multiplied the signals received from the Master and each Slave by different values to arrive at a common frequency ([[least common multiple]], LCM) for each Master/Slave pair, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pattern !! Slave Harmonic !! Slave Multiplier !! Master Harmonic !! Master Multiplier !! Common Frequency\n|-\n| Purple || 5f || \u00d76 || 6f || \u00d75 || 30f\n|-\n| Red || 8f || \u00d73 || 6f || \u00d74 || 24f\n|-\n| Green || 9f || \u00d72 || 6f || \u00d73 || 18f\n|}\n\nIt was phase comparison at this common frequency that resulted in the hyperbolic lines of position. The interval between two adjacent hyperbolas on which the signals are in phase was called a ''lane''. Since the wavelength of the common frequency was small compared with the distance between the Master and Slave stations there were many possible lines of position for a given phase difference, and so a unique position could not be arrived at by this method.\n\nOther receivers, typically for aeronautical applications, divided the transmitted frequencies down to the basic frequency (1f) for phase comparison, rather than multiplying them up to the LCM frequency.\n\n=== Lanes and Zones ===\nEarly Decca receivers were fitted with three rotating ''Decometers'' that indicated the phase difference for each pattern. Each Decometer drove a second indicator that counted the number of lanes traversed &ndash; each 360 degrees of phase difference was one lane traversed. In this way, assuming the point of departure was known, a more or less distinct location could be identified.\n\nThe lanes were grouped into ''zones'', with 18 green, 24 red, or 30 purple lanes in each zone. This meant that on the baseline (the straight line between the Master and its Slave) the zone width was the same for all three patterns of a given chain. Typical lane and zone widths on the baseline are shown in the table below (for chain 5B):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Lane or Zone!! Width on Baseline\n|-\n| Purple lane || 352.1 m\n|-\n| Red lane || 440.1 m\n|-\n| Green lane || 586.8 m\n|-\n| Zones (all patterns)|| 10563 m\n|}\n\nThe lanes were numbered 0 to 23 for red, 30 to 47 for green and 50 to 79 for purple. The zones were labelled A to J, repeating after J. A Decca position coordinate could thus be written: Red I 16.30; Green D 35.80. Later receivers incorporated a microprocessor and displayed a position in latitude and longitude.\n\n=== Multipulse ===\n''Multipulse'' provided an automatic method of lane and zone identification by using the same phase comparison techniques described above on lower frequency signals.\n\nThe nominally continuous wave transmissions were in fact divided into a 20-second cycle, with each station in turn simultaneously transmitting all four Decca frequencies (5f, 6f, 8f and 9f) in a phase-coherent relationship for a brief period of 0.45 seconds each cycle. This transmission, known as Multipulse, allowed the receiver to extract the 1f frequency and so to identify which lane the receiver was in (to a resolution of a zone).\n\nAs well as transmitting the Decca frequencies of 5f, 6f, 8f and 9f, an 8.2f signal, known as Orange, was also transmitted. The beat frequency between the 8.0f (Red) and 8.2f (Orange) signals allowed a 0.2f signal to be derived and so resulted in a hyperbolic pattern in which one cycle (360\u00b0) of phase difference equates to 5 zones.\n\nAssuming that one\u2019s position was known to this accuracy, this gave an effectively unique position.\n\n=== Range and Accuracy ===\nDuring daylight, ranges of around {{convert|400|nmi|km|-1}} could be obtained, reducing at night to 200 to {{convert|250|nmi|km|-1}}, depending on propagation conditions.\n\nThe accuracy depended on:\n* Width of the lanes\n* Angle of cut of the hyperbolic lines of position\n* Instrumental errors\n* Propagation errors (for example, [[Skywave]])\n\nBy day these errors could range from a few meters on the baseline up to a nautical mile at the edge of coverage. At night, skywave errors were greater and, on receivers without multipulse capabilities, it was not unusual for the position to jump a lane, sometimes without the navigator knowing.\n\nAlthough in the days of differential [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] this range and accuracy may appear poor, in its day the Decca system was one of the few, if not the only, position fixing system available to many mariners. Since the need for an accurate position is less when the vessel is further from land, the reduced accuracy at long ranges was not a great problem.\n\n== History==\n=== Origins===\nIn 1936 William J. O'Brien, an engineer, contracted tuberculosis which put his career on hold for a period of two years. During this period he had the idea of position fixing by means of phase comparison of continuous wave transmissions. This was not the first such system, but O'Brien apparently developed his version without knowledge of the others, and made several advancements in the art that would prove useful. He initially imagined the system being used for aircraft testing, specifically the accurate calculation of ground speed. Some experiments were carried out in California in 1938, selecting frequencies with harmonic \"beats\" that would allow for station identification in a network of transmitters. Both the [[US Army]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] considered the idea too complicated and work ended in 1939.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=301}}\n\nO\u2019Brien's friend, Harvey F. Schwarz, was chief engineer of the [[Decca Records|Decca Record company]] in England. In 1939 O\u2019Brien sent him details of the system so it could be put forward to the British military. Initially [[Robert Watson-Watt]] reviewed the system but he did not follow it up, deeming it too easily jammed (and likely due to the existing work on the [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, being carried out by Watt's group).{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}} However, in October 1941 the British Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE) became interested in the system, which was then classified as ''Admiralty Outfit QM''. O\u2019Brien brought the Californian equipment to the UK and conducted the first marine trials between [[Anglesey]] and the [[Isle of Man]], at frequencies of 305/610&nbsp;kHz, on 16 September 1942.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=301}}\n\nFurther trials were conducted in the northern [[Irish Sea]] in April 1943 at 70/130&nbsp;kHz. It was decided that the original frequencies were not ideal, and a new system using a 14&nbsp;kHz inter-signal spacing was selected. This led to the common 5, 6, 8 and 9''f'' frequencies, used throughout the life of the Decca system. 7''f'' was reserved for a [[Loran-C]]-like extension, but never developed.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}}  A follow-up test was carried out in the [[Irish Sea]] in January 1944 to test a wide variety of upgrades and production equipment. By this time the competing Gee system was known to the Admiralty and the two systems were tested head-to-head under the code names QM and QH. QM was found to have better sea-level range and accuracy, which led to its adoption.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}}\n\nA three-station trial was held in conjunction with a large-scale assault and landing exercise in the [[Moray Firth]] in February/March 1944. The success of the trials and the relative ease of use and accuracy of the system resulted in Decca receiving an order for 27 ''Admiralty Outfit QM'' receivers. The receiver consisted of an electronics unit with two dials and was known to its operators as the \"Blue Gasmeter Job\". A Decca chain was set up, consisting of a master station at [[Chichester]] and slaves at [[Swanage]] and [[Beachy Head]]. A fourth decoy transmitter was located in the [[Thames Estuary]] as part of the deception that the invasion would be focussed on the [[Calais]] area.\n\n21 minesweepers and other vessels were fitted with ''Admiralty Outfit QM'' and, on 5 June 1944, 17 of these ships used it to accurately navigate across the [[English Channel]] and to sweep the minefields in the planned areas. The swept areas were marked with buoys in preparation for the [[Normandy Landings]].\n\nAfter the initial ship tests, Decca conducted tests in cars, driving in the [[A3 road|Kingston By-Pass]] area to verify receiver accuracy. In the car installation, it was found possible to navigate within an individual traffic lane. The company entertained high hopes that the system could be used in aircraft, to permit much more precise navigation in the critical airspace around airports and urban centres where traffic density was highest.\n\n=== Deployment ===\nAfter the end of [[World War II]] the Decca Navigator Co. Ltd. was formed (1945) and the system expanded rapidly, particularly in areas of [[British Empire|British influence]]; at its peak it was deployed in many of the world's major shipping areas. More than 15,000 receiving sets were in use aboard ships in 1970. There were 4 chains around England, 1 in Ireland and 2 in Scotland, 12 in Scandinavia (5 each in Norway and Sweden and 1 each in Denmark and Finland), a further 4 elsewhere in northern Europe and 2 in Spain.\n\nIn the late 1950s an experimental Decca chain was set up in the United States, in the New York area, to be used for navigating the [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Vertol 107]] helicopters of [[New York Airways]]. These helicopters were operating from the principal local airports\u2014[[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] on Long Island, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] in New Jersey, [[LaGuardia Airport]] in the Borough of Queens, nearer to Manhattan, and a site on the top of the (then) [[MetLife Building|PanAm Building]] on Park Avenue. Use of Decca was essential because its signals could be received down to sea level, were not subject to the line-of-sight limitations of [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]/[[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] and did not suffer the slant-range errors that create problems with VOR/DME close to the transmitters. The Decca installations in the New York Airways helicopters included the unique Decca 'roller map' displays that enabled the pilot to see his or her position at a glance, a concept infeasible with VOR/DME.\n\nThis chain installation was considered highly controversial at the time, for political reasons. This led to the U.S. Coast Guard, under instructions from the Treasury Department to which it reported, banning the use of Decca receivers in ships entering New York harbour for fear that the system might create a de facto standard (as it had become in other areas of the world). It also served to protect the marketing interests of the Hoffman Electronics division of ITT, a principal supplier of VOR/DME systems, that Decca might have been poised to usurp.\n\nThis situation was exacerbated by the workload problems of the Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA), under its executive director Francis McDermott, whose members were forced to use radar data on aircraft positions, relaying those positions by radio to the aircraft from their control locations. An example of the problem, cited by experts, was the [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collision of a Douglas DC8 and a Lockheed Constellation over Staten Island, New York]],<ref>http://specialcollection.dotlibrary.dot.gov/Document?db=DOT-AIRPLANEACCIDENTS&query=(select+719)</ref> that\u2014according to some experts\u2014could have been avoided if the aircraft had been Decca-equipped and could not only have determined their positions more precisely but would not have suffered from the rho-theta position errors inherent in VOR/DME.\n\nOther chains were established in Japan (6 chains); Namibia and South Africa (5 chains); India and Bangladesh (4 chains); Canada (4 chains around [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]]); North-West Australia (2 chains); the [[Persian Gulf]] (1 chain with stations in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and a second chain in the north of the Gulf with stations in Iran) and the Bahamas (1 chain). Four chains were planned for Nigeria but only two were built and these did not enter into public service. Two chains in Vietnam were used during the [[Vietnam War]] for helicopter navigation, with limited success.\nDuring the Cold War period, following WWII, the R.A.F. established a confidential chain in Germany. The Master station was in [[Bad Iburg]] near Osnabr\u00fcck and there were two Slaves. The purpose of this chain was to provide accurate air navigation for the corridor between Western Germany and Berlin in the event that a mass evacuation of allied personnel may be required. In order to maintain secrecy, frequencies were changed at irregular intervals.\n\n=== Decca, Racal, and the closedown ===\n[[Image:Decca Navigator Mk 21.jpg|thumb|Decca Navigator Mk. 21, with the Decometer dials prominent.]]\n[[File:Decca Receiver Philips.jpg|thumb|An ''ap'' Decca receiver Mk II from the 1980s which could be purchased instead of leased. It could store 25 waypoints.]]\n\nThe headquarters of Decca Navigator were at New Malden, Surrey, just off the Kingston by-pass. There was a Decca School, at [[Brixham]], [[Devon]], where employees were sent on courses from time to time. [[Racal]], the UK weapons and communications company, acquired Decca in 1980. Merging Decca's radar assets with their own, Racal began selling off the other portions of the company, including avionics and Decca Navigator.\n\nA significant amount of income from the Decca system was due to the receivers being leased to users, not sold outright. This guaranteed predictable annual income. When the patents on the original technology lapsed in the early 1980s, new receivers were quickly built by a number of companies. In particular, Aktieselskabet Dansk Philips ('Danish Philips', ''ap'') introduced receivers that could be purchased outright, and were much smaller and easier to use than the current Decca counterparts. The \"ap\" versions directly output the longitude and latitude to two decimals  (originally in datum [[ED50]] only) instead of using the \"deco meter\" displays, offering accuracy better than \u00b19.3 m, much better than the Decca units. This also eliminated the need for the special charts printed with Decca lanes and zones.\n\nDecca sued ap for infringement and, in the ensuing court battle, Decca lost the monopoly. That signalled the beginning of the end for the company. Income dwindled and eventually, the UK [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] stepped in, having the [[Trinity House|lighthouse authorities]] take responsibility for operating the system in the early 1990s.\n\nA ruling from the European Union forced the UK government to withdraw funding. The [[general lighthouse authority]] ceased Decca transmissions at midnight on 31 March 2000. The Irish chain provided by [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara|B\u00f3rd Iascaigh Mhara]] continued transmitting until 19 May 2000. Japan continued operating their [[Hokkaid\u014d]] chain until March 2001, the last Decca chain in operation.\n\n== Other applications ==\n\n=== Delrac ===\nIn the immediate post-war era, Decca began studying a long-range system like Decca, but using much lower frequencies to enable reception of [[skywave]]s at long distances. In February 1946 the company proposed a system with two main stations located at [[Shannon Airport]] in Ireland and [[Gander International Airport]] in [[Newfoundland]] (today part of Canada). Together, these stations would provide navigation over the main [[great circle route]] between London and New York. A third station in [[Bermuda]] would provide general ranging information to measure progress along the main track.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}}\n\nWork on this concept continued, and in 1951 a modified version was presented that offered navigation over very wide areas. This was known as '''Delrac''', short for \"Decca Long Range Area Cover\". A further development, including features of the [[General Post Office]]'s [[POPI]] system, was introduced in 1954, proposing 28 stations that provided worldwide coverage.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}} The system was predicted to offer {{convert|10|mile|m}} accuracy at {{convert|2000|mile|km}} range 95% of the time. Further development was ended in favour of the Dectra system.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}}\n\n=== Dectra ===\nIn the early 1960s the [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics]] (RTCA), as part of a wider [[ICAO]] effort, began the process of introducing a standard long-range radio navigation system for aviation use. Decca proposed a system that could offer both high-accuracy at short ranges and trans-Atlantic navigation with less accuracy, using a single receiver. The system was known as '''Dectra''', short for \"Decca Track\".{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}}\n\nUnlike the Delrac system, Dectra was essentially the normal Decca Navigator system with the modification of several existing transmitter sites.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}} These were located at the East Newfoundland and Scottish chains, which were equipped with larger antennas and high-power transmitters, broadcasting 20 times as much energy as normal chain stations. Given that the length of the chain baselines did not change, and were relatively short, at long distance the signal offered almost no accuracy. Instead, Dectra operated as a track system;  aircraft would navigate by keeping themselves within the signal defined by a particular Decca lane.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}}\n\nThe main advantage of Dectra compared to other systems being proposed for the RTCA solution was that it could be used for both medium-range navigation over land, as well as long-range navigation over the Altlantic. In comparison, the [[VOR/DME]] system that ultimately won the competition offered navigation over perhaps a 200&nbsp;mile radius, and could not offer a solution to the long-distance problem.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}} Additionally, as the Decca system provided an X and Y location, as opposed to the angle-and-range VOR/DME, Decca proposed offering it with their Decca Flight Log moving map display to further improve ease of navigation. In spite of these advantages, the RTCA ultimately chose VOR/DME for two primary reasons; VOR offered coverage over about the same range as Decca, about 200&nbsp;miles, but did so with a single transmitter instead of Decca's four, and Decca's frequencies proved susceptible to interference from static due to lightning, while VOR's higher frequencies were not quite as sensitive.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}}\n\nDecca continued to propose that Dectra be used for the long-range role. In 1967 they installed another transmitter in Iceland to provide ranging along the Scotland-Newfoundland track, with a second proposed to be installed on the [[Azores]]. They also installed Dectra receivers with Omnitrac computers and a lightweight version of the Flight Log on a number of commercial airliners, notably a [[BOAC]] [[Vickers VC10]]. The Omnitrac could take inputs from Decca (and Dectra), Loran-C, VOR/DME, an air data computer and doppler radars and combine them all to produce a lat/long output along with bearing, distance-to-go, bearing and an autopilot coupling.<ref>\"Dectra in Iceland\", Decca Navigator News, October 1967</ref> Their efforts to standardize this were eventually abandoned as [[inertial navigation system]]s began to be installed for these needs.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}}\n\n===Hi-Fix===\nA more accurate system named Hi-Fix was developed using signalling in the 1.6&nbsp;MHz range. It was used for specialised applications such as precision measurements involved with oil-drilling and by the [[Royal Navy]] for detailed mapping and surveying of coasts and harbours. The Hi-Fix equipment was leased for a period with temporary chains established to provide coverage of the area required, Hi-Fix was commercialised by Racal Survey in the early 1980s. An experimental chain was installed with coverage of central London and receivers placed in London buses and other vehicles to demonstrate an early vehicle location and tracking system. Each vehicle would report its location automatically via a conventional VHF two-way radio link, the data added to a voice channel.\n\nAnother application was developed by the Bendix Pacific division of Bendix Corporation, with offices in North Hollywood, California, but not deployed: PFNS\u2014Personal Field Navigation System\u2014that would enable individual soldiers to ascertain their geographic position, long before this capability was made possible by the satellite-based GPS (Global Positioning System).\n\nA further application of the Decca system was implemented by the U.S. Navy in the late 1950s and early 1960s for use in the Tongue of the Ocean/Eleuthera Sound area near The Bahamas, separating the islands of Andros and New Providence. The application was for sonar studies made possible by the unique characteristics of the ocean floor.\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the Decca VLF signal discovered on BOAC, later British Airways, test flights to Moscow, was that the carrier switching could not be detected even though the carrier could be received with sufficient strength to provide navigation.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} Such testing, involving civilian aircraft, is quite common and may well not be in the knowledge of a pilot.\n\nThe 'low frequency' signalling of the Decca system also permitted its use on submarines. One 'enhancement' of the Decca system was to offer the potential of keying the signal, using Morse code, to signal the onset of nuclear war. This option was never taken up by the UK government. Messages were clandestinely sent, however, between Decca stations thereby bypassing international telephone calls, especially in non-UK chains.\n\n== Special DECCA towers ==\n* [[Puckeridge DECCA tower]]\n* [[Zeven DECCA-transmitter]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[GEE (navigation)]]\n*[[LORAN|LORAN C]]\n*[[Omega (navigation system)]]\n*[[Local positioning system]]\n*[[Datatrak]]\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal |first=Walter |last=Blanchard |title=Hyperbolic Airborne Radio Navigation Aids \u2014 A Navigator's View of their History and Development |journal=The Journal of Navigation |volume=44 |number=3 |date=September 1991 |ref=harv}}\n**A modified version is =  Jerry Proc, [http://jproc.ca/hyperbolic/gee.html \"The GEE System\"], 14 January 2001\n* The Decca Navigator - Principles and Performance of the System, The Decca Navigator Company Limited, July 1976\n* Night Passage to Normandy, Lieutenant-Commander Oliver Dawkins, R.N.V.R, Decca, 1969\n* The Decca Navigator System on D-Day, 6 June 1944, An Acid Test, Commander Hugh St. A.

In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.<ref name = Wizards23a >projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities.\" Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19).

Kindle edition.</ref>  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.\n\nThis allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.\n\nARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).<ref>{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.\n\nConcerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |author1=Stefanie Chiou |author2=Craig Music |author3=Kara Sprague |author4=Rebekah Wahba |date=5 Dec 2001 |title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101306/http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nDARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite web|url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael |title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516195054/http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History%3ABertram_Raphael |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}</ref> DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].\n\n===Later history (1970\u20131980)===\nThe [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.\n\nThe resulting \"[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]\" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].\n\nBetween 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.\n\nMany of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).\n\n===Recent history (1981\u2013present)===\nDuring the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or [[Hypersonic Research Program (DARPA)|Hypersonic Research Program]]. The [[Strategic Computing Program (DARPA)|Strategic Computing Program]] enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.\n\nOn October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.<ref>''[[Washington Times]]'', \"Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground\", October 29, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}</ref>\n\nOn June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.<ref name=\"Building X Planes\">{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |title=NASA and DARPA plan to release new X-Planes |last=Grady |first=Mary |date=June 5, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=June 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120846/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |title=Darpa to create Cyber Grand Challenge to fight security vulnerabilities |last=Howley |first=Daniel |date=17 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190614/https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |archivedate=18 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program.

With his parents' consent he was [[tonsure]]d, received [[minor orders]] and served in the ancient church of St Mary.

It is thought likely that he was the artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the ''Glastonbury Classbook'', \"one of the first of a series of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period.\"<ref name=\"ja\"/> Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/> Lady  \u00c6thelflaed, King  \u00c6thelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him.<ref name=\"ce\"/> He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King  \u00c6thelstan in 940, the new King, [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], summoned him to his court at [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] and made him a minister.<ref name = \"osv\"/>\n\nAgain, royal favour fostered jealousy among other courtiers and again Dunstan's enemies succeeded in their plots. The king was prepared to send Dunstan away.<ref name=\"ce\"/> There were then at Cheddar certain envoys from the \"Eastern Kingdom\", which probably meant [[East Anglia]]. Dunstan implored the envoys to take him with them when they returned to their homes. They agreed to do so, but it never happened. The story is recorded:\n\n{{quote|... the king rode out to hunt the stag in [[Mendip Forest]]. He became separated from his attendants and followed a stag at great speed in the direction of the Cheddar cliffs. The stag rushed blindly over the precipice and was followed by the hounds. Eadmund endeavoured vainly to stop his horse; then, seeing death to be imminent, he remembered his harsh treatment of St Dunstan and promised to make amends if his life was spared. At that moment his horse was stopped on the very edge of the cliff. Giving thanks to God, he returned forthwith to his palace, called for St. Dunstan and bade him follow, then rode straight to Glastonbury. Entering the church, the king first knelt in prayer before the altar, then, taking St. Dunstan by the hand, he gave him the kiss of peace, led him to the [[abbot]]'s throne and, seating him thereon, promised him all assistance in restoring Divine worship and regular observance.<ref name=\"ce\"/>}}\n\n===Abbot of Glastonbury===\nDunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform.<ref name = \"osv\"/> He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by establishing [[Benedictine]] monasticism at Glastonbury.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/> The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who had been a member of the community at Glastonbury.<ref name=\"Whitelock1979\">{{cite journal |last=Whitelock |first=Dorothy |title=An Old English Account of King Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries |journal=English Historical Documents |date=1979 |volume=1 |page=920}}</ref> Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nNevertheless, not all the members of Dunstan's community at Glastonbury were monks who followed the [[Benedictine Rule]].  In fact, Dunstan's first biographer, 'B.', was a cleric who eventually joined a community of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] at [[Li\u00e8ge]] after leaving Glastonbury.<ref name=\"Winterbottom2011\">{{cite book |last=Winterbottom |first=Michael |title=The Early Lives of St Dunstan |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199605040 |page=lxix}}</ref>\n[[Image:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Remains of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of Glastonbury Abbey church]]\n\nDunstan's first care was to rebuild the Church of St. Peter, rebuild the cloister, and re-establish the monastic enclosure.

His successor was [[Eadred of England|Eadred]]. The policy of the new government was supported by the [[Queen mother]], [[Eadgifu of Kent]], by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Oda the Severe|Oda]], and by the East Anglian nobles, at whose head was the powerful [[ealdorman]] [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King|\u00c6thelstan the \"Half-king\"]]. It was a policy of unification and conciliation with the Danish half of the kingdom.<ref name = \"co\"/> The goal was a firm establishment of royal authority. In ecclesiastical matters it favoured the spread of [[catholicism|Catholic]] observance, the rebuilding of churches, the moral reform of the clergy and laity, and the end of the [[Norse mythology|religion of the Danes]] in England.<ref name=\"cw\"/>\nAgainst all these reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who included most of Dunstan's own relatives, and who had an interest in maintaining established customs.<ref name=\"ce\"/> For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and [[Bishop of Exeter|Crediton]] in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/>\n\n===Changes in fortune===\n[[Image:Eadwig - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Eadwig's reign was marred by conflicts with his family and with Dunstan.]]\nIn 955, Eadred died, and the situation was at once changed. [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]], the elder son of Edmund, who then came to the throne, was a headstrong youth wholly devoted to the reactionary nobles. According to one legend, the feud with Dunstan began on the day of Eadwig's coronation, when he failed to attend a meeting of nobles. When Dunstan eventually found the young monarch, he was cavorting with a noblewoman named \u00c6lfgifu and her mother, and refused to return with the bishop. Infuriated by this, Dunstan dragged Eadwig back and forced him to renounce the girl as a \"strumpet\". Later realising that he had provoked the king, Dunstan fled to the apparent sanctuary of his cloister, but Eadwig, incited by \u00c6lfgifu, whom he married, followed him and plundered the monastery.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nAlthough Dunstan managed to escape, he saw that his life was in danger. He fled England and crossed the channel to Flanders, where he found himself ignorant of the language and of the customs of the locals.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/> The [[Counts of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I]], received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of [[Blandijnberg|Mont Blandin]], near [[Ghent]].<ref name=\"ce\"/> This was one of the centres of the Benedictine revival in that country, and Dunstan was able for the first time to observe the strict observance that had seen its rebirth at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] at the beginning of the century. His exile was not of long duration. Before the end of 957, the [[Mercia]]ns and [[Northumbria]]ns revolted and drove out Eadwig, choosing his brother [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] as king of the country north of the Thames.<ref name = \"co\"/> The south remained faithful to Eadwig. At once Edgar's advisers recalled Dunstan.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/>\n\n== Bishop and archbishop (957\u2013978)==\n\n===Bishop of Worcester and of London===\n\nOn Dunstan's return, Archbishop [[Oda the Severe|Oda]] consecrated him a bishop and, on the death of [[Coenwald]] of [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]] at the end of 957, Oda appointed Dunstan to the see.<ref name=Powicke260>{{cite book|author1-link=Maurice Powicke| last1=Powicke| first1= F.

One of Eadwig's final acts had been to appoint a successor to Archbishop Oda, who died on 2 June 958. The chosen candidate was [[\u00c6lfsige]] of Winchester, but he died of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to [[Holy See|Rome]] for the [[pallium]]. In his place Eadwig then nominated the Bishop of Wells, [[Byrhthelm (Bishop of Wells)|Byrhthelm]]. As soon as [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] became king, he reversed this second choice on the ground that Byrhthelm had not been able to govern even his first diocese properly.<ref name=\"ce\"/> The archbishopric was then conferred on Dunstan.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/>\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[Image:MS.

His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in [[Christ|Jesus Christ]].\n\nOn his return from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his position as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice [[\u00c6lfstan (bishop of London)|\u00c6lfstan]] was appointed to the Bishopric of London, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] to that of Worcester. In 963, [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester|\u00c6thelwold]], the Abbot of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church.<ref name = \"osv\"/> The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible.<ref name=\"me\">{{Cite book |last=Hollister |first=C.

Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position.<ref name=\"cw\"/> The state saw reforms as well.<ref name = \"ODCC\"/> Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law.

In 975 he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward \"the Martyr\"]].<ref name = \"ODCC\"/> His accession was disputed by his stepmother, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Queen of England|\u00c6lfthryth]], who wished her own son [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Edward was chosen and crowned at Winchester.<ref name = \"osv\"/> Edgar's death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at once there was a determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by [[\u00c6thelstan Half-King#Family|\u00c6thelwine]], the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] were held to settle these disputes, at [[Oxfordshire|Kyrtlington]], at [[Calne]], and at [[Amesbury]]. At the second of them the floor of the hall where the Witan was sitting gave way, and all except Dunstan, who clung to a beam, fell into the room below; several men were killed.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\n==Final years (978\u201388)==\nIn March 978, King Edward was assassinated at [[Corfe Castle]], possibly at the instigation of his stepmother, and \u00c6thelred the Unready became king. His coronation on [[Low Sunday]] 31 March 978, was the last state event in which Dunstan took part.<ref name=\"ce\"/> When the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom,<ref name=\"wsc139\">{{Cite book |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |title=The Birth of Britain |page=139 |publisher=Dodd, Mead |year=1966 }}</ref> but Dunstan's influence at court was ended.<ref name=\"ODCC\"/> Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the [[cathedral school]].<ref name = \"osv\"/>\n\nOnly three more public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere of Mercia]] in the solemn [[translation (relic)|translation of the relic]]s of King Edward, soon to be regarded as a saint, from their grave at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] to a shrine at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. In 984, in obedience to a vision of [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]], he persuaded King \u00c6thelred to appoint [[Alphege|\u00c6lfheah]] as Bishop of Winchester in succession to \u00c6thelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]].<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nDunstan's retirement at Canterbury consisted of long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, as well as his regular attendance at Mass and the [[Canonical hours|daily office]]. He visited the shrines of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] and [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|St \u00c6thelberht]], and there are reports of a vision of angels who sang to him heavenly canticles.<ref name=\"ce\"/> He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity.<ref name=\"co\"/> He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On the vigil of [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Day 988, it is recorded that a vision of angels warned he would die in three days.<ref name=\"ce\"/> On the feast day itself, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the [[Mass (liturgy)#Liturgy of the Word|Gospel]], at the [[benediction#Christianity|benediction]], and after the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well.<ref name=\"msc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.missionstclare.com/english/people/may19.html |title=Biography: St. Dunstan |accessdate=2 August 2007 |work=Mission St. Clare}}</ref> That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received [[Extreme Unction]] and the [[Viaticum]], and died. Dunstan's final words are reported to have been, \"He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him.\"<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nThe English people accepted him as a [[saint]] shortly thereafter. He was formally [[canonised]] in 1029. That year at the Synod of Winchester, St Dunstan's feast was ordered to be kept solemnly throughout England.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nUntil [[Thomas Becket]]'s fame overshadowed Dunstan's, he was the favourite saint of the English people. Dunstan had been buried in his [[Canterbury Cathedral#Later Saxon and Viking|cathedral]]; and when that building was destroyed by a fire in 1074, his relics were translated by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] to a tomb on the south side of the high altar in the rebuilt [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nPart of the decoration to the side of his tomb is still visible, and consists of some painted [[Diapering|diaperwork]], which can be viewed by visitors to the Cathedral.\n\nThe monks of Glastonbury used to claim that during the sack of Canterbury by the [[Viking|Danes]] in 1012, Dunstan's body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop [[William Warham]], who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics still to be there. Within a century, however, his shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nDunstan became [[patron saint]] of English [[goldsmith]]s and silversmiths because he worked as a silversmith making church plate. His Feast Day is 19 May, which is why before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office [[hallmark]]s ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.\n\n[[Blind Veterans UK|St Dunstan's]]\u2014the charity that provides support, rehabilitation, and respite care to blind ex-service personnel of the [[British Armed Forces]]\u2014is named after him, as are many churches all over the world. [[Church of St. Dunstan, Mayfield|St Dunstan's, Mayfield]], [[St Dunstan's, Stepney]], [[St Dunstan-in-the-East|St Dunstan-in-the-East, London]], and [[St Dunstan-in-the-West|St Dunstan-in-the-West, London]] are four of the more well known in Britain. The [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|church at the junction of London Road and Whitstable Road]] gives its name to the neighbourhood of Canterbury on the north bank of the [[river Stour, Kent|River Stour]].\n\n[[English literature]] contains many references to him, for example in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]],{{efn|\"Foggier yet, and colder!

Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun, beaten, denied sleep and food and/or sexually assaulted. But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: [[Ted Patrick]], one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed; in November 1987, [[Cyril Vosper]], a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group, [[Family Action Information Resource|FAIR]], was convicted in Munich of \"causing bodily harm\" in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts; and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere.<ref>http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Colombrito vs. Kelly'', the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:\n\n{{quote|Deprogrammers are people who, at the request of a parent or other close relative, will have a member of a religious sect seized, then hold him against his will and subject him to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs. Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000.\n\nThe deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut off from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval. Members of the deprogramming group, as well as members of the family, come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religious beliefs.}}\n\nDeprogrammer [[Carol Giambalvo]] writes in the 1998 text \"Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation\":\n\n{{quote|It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken \u2013 or \"snapped\" as some termed it \u2013 by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason in some cases cult leader's pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation. There are horror stories \u2013 promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves \u2013 about restraint, beatings, and even rape. And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience \u2013 several of handcuffs, weapons wielded and sexual abuse. But thankfully, these are in the minority \u2013 and in our minds, never justified. Nevertheless, deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable.<ref>[[Giambalvo, Carol]] (November 1998).

For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled.<ref name=\"levine\">{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 =  | year = 1979 | title = The Role of Psychiatry in the Phenomenon of Cults | url = | journal = Canada Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = | page = }}</ref> It is Levine's professional opinion that once deprogrammed, a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want. He states that deprogramming destroys a person's identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others. \"Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency.  It robs people of their sense of responsibility.  Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake, it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others.\"<ref name=\"levine\"/><ref>Understanding Cults and New Age Religions, by Irving Hexham, Karla Poewe, and J. I. Packer</ref>\n\n==Government==\n\nDeprogramming activities often fall outside of the law. Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of \"correct\" beliefs and behaviors.<ref name=\"richardson\"/>  This can involve \"vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government\" and have been \"given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs\nof the unpopular movement or group being targeted\".<ref name=\"richardson\"/>\n\n==Controversy and related issues==\n{{See also|Mind control#Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement|l1=Mind control: Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement}}\n\nIn the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s [[mind control]] was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek [[conservatorship]]s and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.<ref name=Rusher/>\n\nOne aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methods\u2014even kidnapping\u2014to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.\n\nOne of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to [[exit counseling]]) is the contention that they begin with a [[false premise]]. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some [[civil libertarian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.\n\n[[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]] wrote:\n{{Quote|Deprogrammers are like the American colonials who persecuted \"witches\": a confession, drawn up before the suspect was brought in for torturing and based on the judges' fantasies about witchcraft, was signed under duress and then treated as justification for the torture.<ref>Bromley, David G., and Shupe, Anson D., Jr. (1981) Strange Gods, The Great American Cult Scare. Boston: Beacon (pp. 198-204)</ref>}}\n\nA number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogramming:\n\nSome of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them.  Also in 1987, psychologist [[Margaret Singer]] became unusable as an [[expert witness]] after the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) rejected her [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control|''Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control'']] (DIMPAC) report.<ref name=APA_memo>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmcjPkrGTQ8C&lpg=PA54&ots=335cDzpa_5&dq=%22May%2011%2C%201987%22%20dimpac&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=%22May%2011,%201987%22%20dimpac&f=false May 11, 1987, APA MEMORANDUM]</ref>\n\nThe [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published a statement in 1977 which said:\n{{quote|ACLU opposes the use of mental incompetency proceedings, temporary conservatorship, or denial of government protection as a method of depriving people of the free exercise of religion, at least with respect to people who have reached the age of majority. Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials. The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that 'brainwashing' or 'mind control' has been used, in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violated.}}\n\nIn the 1980s in the United States, namely in [[New York (state)|New York]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1981), [[Kansas]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1982), and [[Nebraska]] (conservatorship legislation for 1985), lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming.\n\nRev. [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church]] (many of whose members were targets of deprogramming) issued this statement in 1983:\n\n{{quote|The methods involved in \"deprogramming\" are like those used in Communist concentration camps. Using parents and relatives to entrap members, \"deprogrammers\" commit grown adults to mental hospitals with the supposed \"illness\" of holding of a minority religious belief. Other typical deprogramming techniques include kidnapping, illegal detention, violence, psychological harassment, [[sleep deprivation]], inducement to use alcohol and drugs, sexual seduction and rape. By such threats, harassment and manipulation, professional \"deprogrammers\" force members to renounce their faith. Many people are injured physically and psychologically because of this criminal activity.<ref>[http://www.unification.net/1983/831125.html]</ref>}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, deprogrammer [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]] was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN $1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into [[bankruptcy]].<ref>[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/CAN/02/01.htm Scott vs. Ross, Workman, Simpson.] Retrieved May 31, 2007.</ref> This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.<ref name=\"holywars\"/>\n\n==Referral and kickback system==\nAnti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.<ref>\nDavis, D. and B.

Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more (estimated in 1993). Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.<ref>http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0121a.html</ref>\n\n[[Steven Hassan]], author of the book ''[[Combatting Cult Mind Control]]'', states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980.<ref>[http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/refuting/ Refuting the Disinformation Attacks Put Forth by Destructive Cults and their Agents], by Steven Hassan</ref> Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of ''Combatting'', Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual. Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession, and he refers to his method as \"strategic intervention therapy\".\n\n==In popular culture==\n* ''[[Faults (film)|Faults]]'', a 2014 drama movie about deprogramming\n* ''[[Holy Smoke!]]'', a 1999 movie based on the book with the same name\n* [[Split Image (film)|''Split Image'']], a 1982 movie about deprogramming \n* ''Deprogrammed'', a 2015 Canadian [[documentary]]<ref>[http://www.eyesteelfilm.com/deprogrammed ''Deprogrammed''].

Superman co-creator [[Joe Shuster]] named the ''Daily Star'' after the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' newspaper in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], which had been the newspaper that Shuster's parents received and for which Shuster had worked as a newsboy.

The story resulted in Perry earning a [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>''New Adventures of Superboy'' #12 (December 1980)</ref> During Clark Kent's years in college, Perry White was promoted to editor-in-chief upon the retirement of the ''Daily Planet'''s previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.<ref name=\"STSS4\">''Superman: The Secret Years'' #4 (May 1985)</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from Metropolis University with a degree in [[journalism]], Clark Kent went to work at the ''Planet'', and quickly met Lois Lane (who had been working there for some time already).<ref name=\"STSS4\" /><ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #133 (November 1959)</ref> After Clark was hired, Jimmy Olsen joined the paper's staff.<ref>''Superman\u2019s Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #36 (April 1959)</ref>\n\nIn 1971, the ''Daily Planet'' was purchased by [[Morgan Edge]], president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System. Edge proceeded to integrate Metropolis [[television]] station WGBS-TV's studios into the ''Daily Planet'' building, and named Clark Kent as the anchor for the WGBS evening news.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #233 (January 1971)</ref> Eventually, Clark's former schoolmate from Smallville [[Lana Lang]] joined Clark as a co-anchor.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #317 (November 1977)</ref>\n\nAfter the 1985\u20131986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', many of these elements, including Morgan Edge buying the ''Daily Planet'', were [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively changed]] or eliminated from the Superman canon.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\nIn the post-Crisis comics' canon, years before Clark or Lois began working for the paper, [[Lex Luthor]] owned the ''Daily Planet.'' When Luthor, deciding to sell the paper, began taking bids for the ''Planet'', Perry White convinced an international conglomerate, TransNational Enterprises, to buy the paper. They agreed to this venture with only one stipulation: that Perry White would become editor-in-chief. White had served as the ''Planet'' editor-in-chief ever since, barring the few times he was absent. During those times people such as Sam Foswell and Clark Kent have looked after the paper. [[Franklin Stern]], an old friend of White's, became the ''Daily Planet'''s publisher.\n\nThe ''Planet'' saw its share of rough times during White's tenure. For example, it had many violent worker [[strike action|strikes]]. The building itself, along with most of the city, was destroyed during the \"Fall of Metropolis\" storyline; it is only much later that it was restored by the efforts of various superheroes. The ''Planet'' building sustained heavy damages after the villain [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s rampage. Later, Franklin Stern decided to put the paper up for sale. [[Lex Luthor]], disliking the heavy criticism of himself and his company that the ''Planet'' became noted for, purchased the ''Daily Planet'' and subsequently closed the paper down. Luthor fired every employee of the newspaper except for four people: Simone D'Neige, Dirk Armstrong, [[Jimmy Olsen]], and [[Lois Lane]]. As a final insult, Luthor saw to it that the ''Planet'' globe was unceremoniously dumped in the Metropolis [[landfill]]. In the ''Planet'''s place emerged \"LexCom,\" a news-oriented [[Internet]] website that primarily catered to Luthor's views of \"quality journalism.\"\n\nAfter Lois Lane made a deal with Luthor where, in exchange for him returning the ''Planet'' to Perry, she would kill one story of his choosing with no questions asked, Luthor sold the ''Daily Planet'' to Perry White for the token sum of one dollar. The paper was quickly reinstated, rehiring all of its old staff. Sometime later, ownership of the ''Planet'' fell into the hands of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], where it has remained ever since. In the ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' storyline, it is named a [[subsidiary]] of [[Wayne Enterprises#Wayne Entertainment|Wayne Entertainment]].\n\nDuring the \"Y2K\" storyline (involving the city of Metropolis being infused with futuristic technology thanks to a descendant of the villain [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]), the ''Daily Planet'' building was \"upgraded\" along with the rest of Metropolis, and a holographic globe replaced the physical one. Eventually due to temporal instabilities caused by the B13 Virus, Metropolis and the Daily Planet building, globe and all, were restored to their former states.\n\nIn the current comics and media spinoffs, the ''Daily Planet'' is presented as a thoroughly modern news operation, including operating an Internet website much like most large newspapers. The ''Planet'''s reporters also have access to the best modern equipment to aid their work, though Perry White has often been shown as still favoring his manual [[typewriter]]. In 2008, it was said that Clark (at least in this era/continuity) uses a typewriter at his desk due to his powers causing minor interference in regular desktop computers.<ref>''[[Action Comics|Action Comics Annual]]'' #11 (2008)</ref>\n\nDuring this era, the ''Planet''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s major competitors in Metropolis include the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper the ''Daily Star'', WGBS-TV (which also employed [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Cat Grant]] for a time), and [[Lex Luthor]]'s various media operations. A contemporary publication is ''Newstime'' Magazine, where Clark Kent worked as the editor for a time. The publisher of ''Newstime'' is Colin Thornton, who is secretly the demon [[Blaze and Satanus|Satanus]], an enemy of Superman's.\n\n===''Superman: Birthright''===\nIn the ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' limited series, the ''Daily Planet'''s publisher was Quentin Galloway, an abrasive overbearing loudmouth who bullied Jimmy Olsen, and later Clark Kent, before being told off by Lois Lane, whom Galloway could not fire because of her star status.<ref>Bailey, Neal.

These changes were explained gradually over the next several years. The 2009 mini-series ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' clarified the earlier history of the ''Planet'' in the new continuity. The story established that while Lex Luthor, in the revised history, owns every media in Metropolis and uses it to enforce his [[public relations|public image]] as a wealthy benefactor, the ''Planet'' had always stood free, refusing him ownership and even condemning his actions in editorials signed by Perry White himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the ''Planet'', the newspaper was almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters.<ref>''Superman: Secret Origin'' #3 (January 2010)</ref> This changed after Superman begins his career. Thanks to Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen when he debuts, the paper's circulation increased 700%.\n\nGeneral [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]] (Lois' father) attempted to capture Superman, seeing him as an alien threat. When he failed to do so, he forcibly shut down the ''Planet'' as part of an attempt to force Perry White and Lois to turn over any information they had on Superman that they haven't released to the public. Eventually, Superman turned the public to his favor and Sam Lane was seen in a bad light after his soldier John Corben AKA [[Metallo]] ruthlessly endangered civilians. These events lead to the people of Metropolis no longer looking at Lex Luthor as a savior and ''The Daily Planet'' becomes the city's top-selling paper, as well as a major player in media.\n\nIn ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #2, the villain [[Clayface]] triggers an explosion in The ''Daily Planet'' building, greatly damaging the offices, leaving many injured and at least one person dead. Lois Lane is hospitalized. Despite the chaos of ''Final Crisis'' and more than half of humanity being enslaved by evil, the newspaper continues to spread news and inform the public via a printing press in Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]]. In ''Final Crisis'' #7, it is shown functioning once again.\n\n===The New 52===\nWith the reboot of DC's line of comics in 2011, the ''Daily Planet'' was shown in the ''Superman'' comics as being bought by Morgan Edge and merged with the [[Galaxy Broadcasting System]], similar to the Silver/Bronze Age continuity.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 3) #1 (September 2011)</ref> In ''Action Comics'', it is revealed that in the new history/universe, Clark Kent begins his journalism career in Metropolis roughly six years before Galaxy Broadcasting merges with the ''Daily Planet''. Along with being a writer for ''The Daily Star'', partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of everyday citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the ''Star'', Clark meets ''Planet'' photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lane's work at the ''Daily Planet'', eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves ''The Daily Star'' on good terms and accepts a position at ''The Daily Planet''.\n\nAfter the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the \"Superman beat.\" But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the ''Daily Planet'' is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clark's friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.\n\nAt the conclusion of the New 52, following the New 52 Superman's death, Lex Luthor buys the ''Daily Planet''.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #52</ref>\n\n===30th and 31st Centuries===\nIn virtually every incarnation of the era inhabited by the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], the ''Daily Planet'' is depicted as a fixture in Metropolis, and one of Earth's major media sources. Frequently, the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]'s wife [[Iris West Allen]] (a native of the era) is depicted as a member of its staff or editorial board.\n\n==Fictional employees==\n[[File:Daily Planet-Staff.jpg|thumb|The staff of the ''Daily Planet'' from ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 (July 2008).

One of the main characters of ''Smallville'', [[Chloe Sullivan]], worked in the basement of the ''Planet'' (seasons 5-7). Her cousin [[Lois Lane#Smallville|Lois Lane]] continues to work there, as did Chloe's on again/off again love interest (and eventual husband) [[Jimmy Olsen]] until his death at the end of season 8. [[Clark Kent]] started to work at the ''Daily Planet'' as a copy boy in the show's eighth season, but eventually worked his way up to a reporter in the ninth season. In episode 10 of the 6th season a street sign is shown as Chloe ([[Allison Mack]]) runs out of the ''Daily Planet'' from Linda Lake ([[Tori Spelling]]) and shows that the ''Planet'' is located at 355 Burrard St. Smallville also features the ''Daily Star'' as a separate newspaper, which was first seen in \"Icarus\".\n* ''The Daily Planet'' was mentioned in various episodes of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.\n\n===Films===\n*In 1978's ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and its sequels, the ''Daily Planet'' exterior was the New York [[New York Daily News|''Daily News'']] building. The globe, which used to be on the top of the building, was apparently replaced with one in the lobby as to make room for a [[helipad]] on the roof. In fact, [[Daily News Building|The Daily News building]] in New York has featured a globe in its lobby for almost all of its history. The real-life ''Daily News'' was headquartered in The News Building until the mid-1990s.\n*The 2006 ''[[Superman Returns]]'' movie has redesigned the ''Daily Planet'' as a completely computer generated image of a fictional building inserted into the [[Empire State Building]] skyline.\n*In the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' the ''Daily Planet'' exterior was filmed in the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]].

It supports a defined set of inter-networking facilities.\n\nDPNSS was originally defined by [[British Telecom]]. The specification for the protocol is defined in BTNR188. The specification currently comes under the Network Interoperability Consultative Committee.\n\n==History==\nDPNSS was developed in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, [[Post Office Telecommunications]] in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product 'Megastream' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for [[Private Branch Exchange|PBX]]s. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the [[liberalization]] rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital ([[PCM]]-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the [[Plessey|Plessey PDX]] (a licensed version of the [[ROLM|ROLM CBX]]) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the [[Northern Telecom]] SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, '[[Channel-associated signaling|CAS]]' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from [[PSTN]] signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.\nThe support for DPNSS as BT's own signaling protocol also differentiated BT's private circuit\u2019s services from those of its emerging rival [[Mercury Communications]].\nDPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT & Plessey) but quickly snowballed with [[Mitel|MITEL]], [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], [[Ericsson]], [[Philips]] and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.\nBT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and [[CCITT]] (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of [[Q931]] and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.\nThere were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the [[ANSI]] standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.\nVersion 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with [[ISDN]] features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS 'APNSS' was developed using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a [[modem]] to support D channel signalling.\n\n==Overview of the Protocol==\nLayer 1(CCITT) ITU-G703 defines the physical and electrical interface. G704 defines the Frame structure of the 2,048 Mbs sent across the link. G732 defines the allocation of that frame structure into the 32 discrete 64Kbit 'channels', of which 0 is used for alignment of the frames and 16 is (by convention only) allocated to common channel signaling. Speech is carried as G711.\nLayer 2 Timeslot 16, 64Kbs operates as [[HDLC]] [[LAPB]], to support up to 60 PVCs or [[Data link connection identifier|DLC]]s (data link connections) (30 directly associated with the bearer channels and 30 for unrelated messages) as the specification describes them. Therefore, at maximum operation, each potential traffic channel can have two simultaneous data channels available for messages. Note that HDLC operates as a statistical [[multiplexing]] system. When traffic deltas are low, a single call establishment message will have access to the full 64Kbs (allowing for overheads).\nDPNSS is a layer 3 protocol functioning as common channel signaling. The functionality is divided into Levels (confusingly nothing to do with OSI layers.) Levels 1-6 deal with simple call establishment (make call/break call) and are the minimum requirements by which a PBX can be said to be DPNSS compatible. The remaining levels are allocated to telephony features, supplementary services or to administrative features. Note that support of 'levels' by a PBX is not necessarily incremental. Some levels are interdependent but a PBX may omit support of some levels (above 6) and support others.\n\nDPNSS is a compelled protocol in that each instruction issued must be met with an appropriate response from the other PBX otherwise the message is re-transmitted (until timer expiry). This means that when interworking two PBXs features invoked on PBX A must be acknowledged by PBX B even if that feature is not supported.\nDPNSS carries its protocol messages as short strings of IA5 text. It is therefore much easier to interpret in its native form than Q931/Qsig or [[H323]]/H450 and a precursor to the plain language format of SIP.\n\n==Practical Considerations==\nAs HDLC can operate successfully in quite poor (errored) data environments, DPNSS will work over a 2 Mbit/s link running without proper synchronisation (plesiochronously) and over poor quality connections (including badly terminated connectors). When setting up PBXs to run a DPNSS connection one end must be defined as the primary or 'A' end. This is a protocol requirement and has nothing to do with link synchronisation. However, such badly synchronised links were frowned upon because of the problems associated with sending faxes and/or other modem based communication which were not specifically identified within the protocol.\n\n==DPNSS and VoIP==\nFor a protocol that began life in the 1980s, DPNSS is natively a long way from [[VoIP]]. However, many of the hybrid VoIP PBXs available from manufacturers worldwide provide on-board DPNSS trunk cards. Where they do not, a protocol converter is necessary. Commercially available equipment offers the ability to convert from DPNSS to Q.Sig. Note that it is also possible to tunnel DPNSS and its associated PCM (G711) over an IP network. This can be point to point where the IP network carries packetised voice N x 64 Kbs speech and a separate IP signalling channel to carry the notional 64 Kbs of DPNSS signalling. A more sophisticated solution uses intelligence on the edge of the IP network to route voice to the correct node. This is a [[Voice VPN]].\nNote that this should not be confused with the pre-VOIP 'Voice VPN' deployed by routing calls intelligently in a TDM switching platform, often [[Nortel]] DMS100 and customers PBX nodes.\n\n==Criticisms==\nSome critics of DPNSS suggest that it is too loosely defined and allows too much latitude in its interpretation of message formats and timers. It is also sometimes mistakenly believed that DPNSS is semi proprietary and that it is only possible to connect PBXs from the same manufacturer. i.e. [[Siemens]] will connect to Siemens, Mitel to Mitel etc. Experience indicates that this is not the case and BT's FeatureNet platform (Nortel's DMS100) running DPNSS, has interconnected successfully to many PBX types available in the UK. In addition, as part of the first commercial implementation of DPNSS (in the Government Telephone Network or GTN in 1983), BT insisted that the core of the network be made from PBXs of different manufacture to prove the interoperability in real life.\n\n==See also==\n* [[DASS1|Digital Access Signaling System 1 (DASS1)]] (obsolete)\n* [[DASS2|Digital Access Signaling System 2 (DASS2)]] (obsolete)\n* [[QSIG]] (the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] equivalent of DPNSS, uses the [[Q.931]] and [[Remote Operations Service Element protocol|ROSE]] protocols.

British Telecom used the term '''ISDN''' when\ndescribing their DASS2 lines.\n\nDASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2Mbit/s link and can handle 30 simultaneous calls (64kbit/s each). DASS2 is still offered by BT and other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the [[CCITT]] document that describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had previously been known as ''International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee''. The organisation set out the internationally agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102 (also known as EuroISDN). This is a very close implementation of the original CCITT specification. It is a 2Mbit/s service as\nwith DASS2, but the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN (ETS 300 102) lines are available to customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated by their CPE (Customer Premises Equipment),\nusually a PABX.\n\nMost modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system, however\nthe trend seems to be away from the DASS2 (which is no longer being developed by\nBT and has been known to deny problems with their DASS2 circuits), and towards the internationally recognised Q.931 standard, which is utilised by many country's telephony service providers.\n\nThe CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling messages. The layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control the call setup, teardown, and routing.\n\nThe layer 3 messages or ''call control messages'' are the minimum messages that must be understood by the interfacing equipment. Individual service providers may\npublish their own documentation which details further messages that will be\ntransported in addition to Q.931 messages. There are a number of additional\nEuropean documents that cover supplementary services. These cover features that may be instigated by exchanges via the ISDN and require a higher degree of layer 3 implementation.\n\n==See also==\n*[[DSS1]] ([[ETSI]] \"[[Europe|Euro]]-ISDN\", also used in many non-European countries)\n*[[DSS2]] (Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 2) - enhanced DSS1.\n\n{{BT Group}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dass2}}\n\n[[Category:BT Group]]\n[[Category:Integrated Services Digital Network]]", "sha1": "29vqh7pm0iju66u5p35vuolwqrpn6b7"}}, {"title": "Devanagari", "ns": "0", "id": "8968", "revision": {"id": "866728175", "parentid": "866727741", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T04:48:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Toshadeva Nandhinatha", "id": "35020199"}, "comment": "/* Consonants */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Nagari}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox writing system\n|name=Devanagari\n|altname = {{lang|und-Deva|\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0940}}\n|sample=Chandas typeface specimen.svg\n|caption=Devanagari script (vowels top, consonants bottom) in [[Chandas font]].\n|type=[[Abugida]]\n|languages=[[Hindi]], [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Dogri language|Dogri]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Newar language|Newar]], [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], [[Magahi language|Magahi]], [[Bhili language|Bhili]], [[Mundari language|Mundari]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and many more\n|time=Early signs: 1st century CE,<ref name=gazett/> modern form: 10th century CE<ref name=\"taylor2003\">{{Citation | title=History of the Alphabet: Aryan Alphabets, Part 2 | author=Isaac Taylor | year=1883 | isbn=978-0-7661-5847-4 |publisher= Kegan Paul, Trench & Co | url=https://archive.org/stream/alphabet00unkngoog#page/n348/mode/2up/|page=333 | quote=''...&nbsp;In the Kutila this develops into a short horizontal bar, which, in the Devanagari, becomes a continuous horizontal line ... three cardinal inscriptions of this epoch, namely, the Kutila or Bareli inscription of 992, the [[Chalukya]] or Kistna inscription of 945, and a Kawi inscription of 919 ... the Kutila inscription is of great importance in Indian epigraphy, not only from its precise date, but from its offering a definite early form of the standard Indian alphabet, the Devanagari ...''}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-509984-3| last = Salomon| first = Richard| title = Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages| location = Oxford| series = South Asia research| date = 1998|pp=39\u201341}}</ref>\n|region=India and Nepal\n|fam1=[[Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic]]<sup>[a]</sup>\n|footnotes=[a] The Semitic origin of the Brahmic scripts is not universally agreed upon.\n|fam2=[[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Br\u0101hm\u012b]]\n|fam3=[[Gupta script|Gupta]]\n|fam4=[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|N\u0101gar\u012b]]\n|sisters=[[Gurmukhi script|Gurmukhi]], [[Nandinagari]]\n|children=[[Gujar\u0101ti script|Gujarati]]<br />[[Mo\u1e0d\u012b script|Mo\u1e0d\u012b]]\n|unicode=[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0900.pdf U+0900\u2013U+097F] Devanagari, <br />[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA8E0.pdf U+A8E0\u2013U+A8FF] Devanagari&nbsp;Extended, <br />[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1CD0.pdf U+1CD0\u2013U+1CFF] Vedic&nbsp;Extensions\n|iso15924=Deva\n }}\n{{Devanagari abugida sidebar}}\n{{brahmic}}\n'''Devanagari''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|d|e\u026a|v|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0251\u02d0|\u0261|\u0259r|i\u02d0}} {{respell|DAY|v\u0259|NAH|g\u0259r|ee}}; {{lang|sa|\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0940}},  {{IAST3|Devan\u0101gar\u012b}}, a compound of \"[[Deva (Hinduism)|''deva'']]\" {{lang|sa|\u0926\u0947\u0935}} and \"[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|''n\u0101gar\u012b'']]\" {{lang|sa|\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0940}}; Hindi pronunciation: {{IPA-hi|de\u02d0\u028b\u02c8na\u02d0\u0261ri|}}), also called '''Nagari''' (''N\u0101gar\u012b'', {{lang|sa|\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0940}}),<ref name=kathleen>Kathleen Kuiper (2010), The Culture of India, New York: The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-1615301492}}, page 83</ref> is an [[abugida]] (alphasyllabary) used in [[India]] and [[Nepal]].

------------------->\n\n===Accent marks===\n{{Main|Vedic accent}}\nThe [[pitch accent]] of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] is written with various symbols depending on [[shakha]].

It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic graphemes to the Latin script. The Devanagari-specific portion is nearly identical to the academic standard for Sanskrit, [[IAST]].<ref name=scriptsource/>\n\n===IAST===\nThe [[IAST|International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST)]] is the academic standard for the romanisation of Sanskrit. IAST is the de facto standard used in printed publications, like books, magazines, and electronic texts with Unicode fonts. It is based on a standard established by the ''Congress of Orientalists'' at [[Athens]] in 1912. The ISO 15919 standard of 2001 codified the transliteration convention to include an expanded standard for sister scripts of Devanagari.<ref name=scriptsource>[http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail_sort&key=Deva Devanagari IAST conventions] Script Source (2009), SIL International, United States</ref>\n\nThe [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]], intended for the romanisation of all Indic scripts, is an extension of IAST.\n\n===Harvard-Kyoto===\nCompared to IAST, [[Harvard-Kyoto]] looks much simpler. It does not contain all the diacritic marks that IAST contains. It was designed to simplify the task of putting large amount of Sanskrit textual material into machine readable form, and the inventors stated that it reduces the effort needed in transliteration of Sanskrit texts on the keyboard.<ref name=translitwijastyk/> This makes typing in Harvard-Kyoto much easier than IAST. Harvard-Kyoto uses [[capital letters]] that can be difficult to read in the middle of words.\n\n===ITRANS===\n[[ITRANS]] is a lossless transliteration scheme of Devanagari into [[ASCII]] that is widely used on [[Usenet]]. It is an extension of the [[Harvard-Kyoto]] scheme. In ITRANS, the word ''devan\u0101gar\u012b'' is written \"devanaagarii\" or \"devanAgarI\". ITRANS is associated with an application of the same name that enables typesetting in [[Brahmic family|Indic scripts]]. The user inputs in Roman letters and the ITRANS pre-processor translates the Roman letters into Devanagari (or other Indic languages). The latest version of [[ITRANS]] is version 5.30 released in July, 2001. It is similar to Velthius system and was created by Avinash Chopde to help print various Indic scripts with personal computers.<ref name=translitwijastyk>[http://indology.info/email/members/wujastyk/ Transliteration of Devan\u0101gar\u012b] D. Wujastyk (1996)</ref>\n\n==== Velthuis ====\n{{Main|Velthuis}}\n\nThe disadvantage of the above [[ASCII]] schemes is case-sensitivity, implying that transliterated names may not be capitalised. This difficulty is avoided with the system developed in 1996 by Frans Velthuis for [[TeX]], loosely based on IAST, in which case is irrelevant.\n\n===ALA-LC Romanisation===\nALA-LC<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman.html |title=LOC.gov |publisher=LOC.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> romanisation is a transliteration scheme approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association, and widely used in North American libraries.

It originated at [[IIT Kanpur]] for computational processing of Indian languages. The salient features of this transliteration scheme are as follows.\n* Every consonant and every vowel has a single mapping into Roman. Hence it is a [[prefix code]], advantageous from computation point of view.\n* Lower-case letters are used for unaspirated consonants and short vowels, while capital letters are used for aspirated consonants and long vowels. While the retroflex stops are mapped to 't, T, d, D, N', the dentals are mapped to 'w, W, x, X, n'. Hence the name 'WX', a reminder of this idiosyncratic mapping.\n\n==Encodings==\n\n===ISCII===\n[[ISCII]] is an 8-bit encoding. The lower 128 codepoints are plain [[ASCII]], the upper 128 codepoints are ISCII-specific.\n\nIt has been designed for representing not only Devanagari but also various other [[Indic scripts]] as well as a Latin-based script with diacritic marks used for transliteration of the Indic scripts.\n\nISCII has largely been superseded by Unicode, which has, however, attempted to preserve the ISCII layout for its Indic language blocks.\n\n===Unicode===\n\n{{Main|Devanagari (Unicode block)|Devanagari Extended|Vedic Extensions|l2=Devanagari Extended (Unicode block)|l3=Vedic Extensions (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe Unicode Standard defines three blocks for Devanagari: Devanagari (U+0900\u2013U+097F), Devanagari Extended (U+A8E0\u2013U+A8FF), and Vedic Extensions (U+1CD0\u2013U+1CFF).\n\n{{Unicode chart Devanagari}}\n{{Unicode chart Devanagari Extended}}\n{{Unicode chart Vedic Extensions}}\n\n==Devanagari keyboard layouts==\n<!-- [[Keyboard layout#Devanagari]] links here -->\n{{hatnote|For a list of Devanagari input tools and fonts, please see [[Help:Multilingual support (Indic)]].}}\n[[File:\u0907\u0928\u094d\u0938\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u094d\u091f \u0915\u0933\u092a\u093e\u091f\u093e\u091a\u0940 \u0913\u0933\u0916.ogg|200px|right|Introduction to Inscript Key board]]\n\n=== InScript layout ===\n[[InScript]] is the standard [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] layout for Devanagari as standardized by the Government of India.

InScript is also available in some touchscreen mobile phones.\n[[File:Devanagari INSCRIPT Keyboard.JPG|thumb|none|middle|upright=4|Devanagari INSCRIPT bilingual keyboard layout.]]\n\n===Typewriter===\nThis layout was used on manual typewriters when computers were not available or were uncommon. For backward compatibility some typing tools like [[Indic IME]] still provide this layout.\n\n===Phonetic===\nSuch tools work on phonetic transliteration. The user writes in Roman and the [[Input method editor|IME]] automatically converts it into Devanagari. Some popular phonetic typing tools are [[Baraha]] IME and [[Google IME]].\n\n[[File:Marathi Wikipedia ULS.webm|thumb|right|300px|One can use [[:MW:Universal Language Selector|ULS]] {{lang|und-Deva|\"\u0905\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0930\u0923\"}} ([[Transliteration]]) or {{lang|und-Deva|\"\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0932\u093f\u092a\u0940\"}} ([[InScript keyboard|Inscript]]) typing options to search or edit [[:mr:|Marathi Wikipedia]] articles as shown in this video clip; One can click on the '''cc'' to change the subtitle languages to Marathi, English, Sanskrit, Kokani, Ahirani languages.]]\n\nThe [[Mac OS X]] operating system includes two different [[keyboard layout]]s for Devanagari: one is much like INSCRIPT/KDE Linux, the other is a phonetic layout called \"Devanagari QWERTY\".\n\nAny one of Unicode fonts input system is fine for Indic language Wikipedia and other wikiprojects, including Hindi, Bhojpuri, Marathi, Nepali Wikipedia.

In practice, a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the '''embassy''', which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country, usually but not necessarily the receiving state's [[Capital (political)|capital]] city. [[Consulates]], on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located outside the capital of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state). As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdSOAAAAMAAJ&q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&hl=en&ei=BIlvTbTLGIeZhQeHgIlQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgo Tom Nierop, ''Systems and Regions in Global Politics''] (Wiley, John and Sons 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-471-94942-8}}), p. 67.</ref><ref>\"The Russian Federation has diplomatic relations with a total of 187 countries, but some of them \u2013 mainly for financial reasons \u2013 maintain non-resident embassies in other countries\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=87e5AAAAIAAJ&q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&hl=en&ei=zrNuTaCUKMiHhQe6kOk-&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTge ''International Affairs''], issues 4\u20136 (Znanye Pub.

The term \"embassy\" is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but, strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the [[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]]. Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.\n\nThe members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission's chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|title=1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, article 30|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAll missions to the [[United Nations]] are known simply as permanent missions, while [[EU member states]]' missions to the [[European Union]] are known as permanent representations, and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador. European Union missions abroad are known as EU delegations. Some countries have more particular naming for their missions and staff: a [[Holy See|Vatican]] mission is headed by a [[nuncio]] ([[Latin]] for \"envoy\") and consequently known as an [[apostolic nunciature]]. Under the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libya's missions]] used the name \"people's bureau\", headed by a secretary.\n\nMissions between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries are known as high commissions, and their heads are high commissioners.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrRdc5SI_R4C&pg=PT50#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=33|title=Introduction To Tourism And Hospitality Industry|author=Sidhur Andrews|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|date= 1 Jun 2007 }}</ref> Generally speaking, ambassadors and high commissioners are regarded as equivalent in status and function and embassies and high commissions are both deemed to be diplomatic missions. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/diplomatic-and-consular-representations/|title=Diplomatic and Consular Representations|first=Jim S.|last=Nutt|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/cpadocs/cpa%20address%20140311.pdf|title=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, \"What does the work of a High Commissioner involve?\"|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nIn the past a diplomatic mission headed by a lower-ranking official (an ''envoy'' or ''minister resident'') was known as a ''[[legation]]''. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of ''legation'' is no longer used today. (See [[diplomatic rank]].)\n\nA [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] is similar to, but not the same as a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. A consulate or consulate general is generally a representative of the embassy in locales outside of the capital city.<ref name=name/> For instance, the United Kingdom has its [[Embassy of the United Kingdom in Washington, D.C.]], but also maintains seven consulates-general and four consulates elsewhere in the US. The person in charge of a consulate or consulate-general is known as a consul or consul-general, respectively. Similar services may also be provided at the embassy (to serve the region of the capital) in what is normally called a consular section.\n\nIn cases of dispute, it is common for a country to [[Letter of credence|recall]] its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure.  This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] (usually the [[deputy chief of mission]]) who may have limited powers. A charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim also heads the mission during the interim between the end of one chief of mission's term and the beginning of another.\n\n==Extraterritoriality==\n[[File:Diplomatic Corps seal - Corps Diplomatique emblem logo.png|thumb|upright=0.45|right|Seal of a [[diplomatic corps]]]]\nContrary to popular belief, most diplomatic missions do not enjoy full [[extraterritorial status]] and \u2013 in those cases \u2013 are not sovereign territory of the represented state.<ref>'[http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/miscellaneous/laws-and-rules-regarding-extraterritoriality/ Laws and Rules Regarding Extraterritoriality]' on integrity-legal.com: \"There is a common misconception that Embassies and Consulates have extraterritoriality. As anecdotal evidence of this misconception, people will often say things like, 'the US Embassy sits upon United States soil.' For the most part, this is not the case as extraterritoriality is not conferred upon an Embassy or Consulate, but in some situations extraterritoriality may be created by Treaty\".</ref>  Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions usually remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].  Diplomats themselves still retain full [[diplomatic immunity]], and (as an adherent to the Vienna Convention) the host country may not enter the premises of the mission without permission of the represented country, even to put out a fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm|title=What is a U.S. Embassy?|website=diplomacy.state.gov}}</ref>  International rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  The term \"extraterritoriality\" is often applied to diplomatic missions, but normally only in this broader sense.\n\nAs the host country may not enter the representing country's embassy without permission, embassies are sometimes used by [[refugee]]s escaping from either the host country or a third country.  For example, [[North Korea]]n nationals, who would be arrested and deported from China upon discovery, have sought sanctuary at various third-country embassies in China. Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country. See the [[list of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission]] for a list of some notable cases.\n\nNotable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy, Beijing (1967),<ref>{{Cite news |first= |date=15 August 2012 |title=Sir Ray Whitney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9478296/Sir-Ray-Whitney.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=17 August 2015 |quote=Red Guards scaled the British mission's wall as diplomats watched the Ealing comedy ''Two-Way Stretch''.

The Chinese set fire to the mission, then used a battering ram on the steel emergency door.}}</ref> the [[Iran hostage crisis]] (1979\u20131981), and the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] at the ambassador's residence in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (1996-1997).\n\n==Role==\n[[File:Embassy of Nicaragua.JPG|thumb|Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.|[[Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.]].]]The Vienna Convention states:<blockquote>The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, inter alia, in representing the sending State in the receiving State; protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships, article 3|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDiplomatic missions between members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are not called embassies, but [[high commission (Commonwealth)|high commission]]s, as Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]]. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state.\n\nThe rights and immunities (such as [[diplomatic immunity]]) of diplomatic missions are codified in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].\n\n==Multiple missions in a city==\nSome cities may host more than one mission from the same country.  An example is Rome, where many states maintain missions to [[Foreign relations of Italy|Italy]] and another to the [[Holy See]].  It is not customary for these missions to share premises nor diplomatic personnel. At present, only the [[Iraq]]i missions to Italy and the [[Holy See]] share premises; however, two ambassadors are appointed, one to each country. In the case of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|UN's Food Agencies]], the Head of Mission to the Italian Republic is usually accredited as [[permanent representative]]. The United States maintains a separate [[United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome]], whose head is the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]]. Kolkata, India hosts two Bangladeshi Deputy High Commissions, one at [[Park Circus]] and another at Mirza Galib Street. This was done to reduce overcrowding inside the Deputy High Commission. At first the Park Circus was opened and later, the one at Mirza Galib Street. Now both the Deputy High Commissions issue Bangladeshi visa.\n\n==Non-diplomatic offices==\n{{main|De facto embassy}}\n\nGovernments of [[List of states with limited recognition|states not recognized by the receiving state]] and of territories that make no claim to be sovereign states may set up offices abroad that do not have official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention. Examples are the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s that represent the government of the [[Republic of China]]; [[Somaliland]]'s Representative Offices in London, [[Addis Ababa]], Rome, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s that represent the government of that territory. Such offices assume some of the non-diplomatic functions of diplomatic posts, such as promoting trade interests and providing assistance to its citizens and residents. They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto, for example.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|International relations}}\n* [[Diplomacy]]\n* [[Embassy chapel]]\n* [[Embassy Row]], Washington, D.C.\n* [[List of attacks on diplomatic missions]] \n* [[Lists of diplomatic missions]]\n* [[List of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission]]\n* [[Paradiplomacy]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Diplomatic missions}}\n* {{wikivoyage-inline|Diplomatic missions}}\n* [http://www.embassypages.com/ Embassies and consulates around the world]\n* [http://www.foreign-trade.com/resources/embassy.htm Embassies and Consulates Search Directory]\n* [http://ididnotknowthatyesterday.blogspot.com/2006/08/whats-difference-between-embassy-and.html What is the difference between an Embassy and a Consulate?]\n\n{{Diplomacy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diplomatic Mission}}\n[[Category:Diplomacy|Missions]]\n[[Category:Diplomatic missions| ]]", "sha1": "ojpdl77hds7gsfimr1m7yjmpef8jhsx"}}, {"title": "DEC Alpha", "ns": "0", "id": "8971", "revision": {"id": "862871004", "parentid": "862315048", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T07:25:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Curly Turkey", "id": "728168"}, "comment": "/* top */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox CPU architecture\n| name       = Alpha\n| designer   = [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]\n| bits       = [[64-bit computing|64-bit]]\n| introduced = 1992\n| design     = RISC\n| type       = Register-Register\n| encoding   = Fixed\n| branching  =\n| endianness = [[Endianness#Bi-endian hardware|Bi]]\n| extensions = Byte/Word Extension (BWX), Square-root and Floating-point Convert Extension (FIX), Count Extension (CIX), Motion Video Instructions (MVI)\n| open       = Yes<ref name=\"facts and comments\" />\n| gpr        = 31 plus always-zero R31\n| fpr        = 31 plus always-0.0 F31\n}}\n[[Image:Alpha AXP 21064 diephoto1.jpg|thumb|DEC Alpha AXP 21064 microprocessor die photo]]\n[[Image:DEC Alpha 21-35023-13 J40793-28 top.jpg|thumb|Package for DEC Alpha AXP 21064 microprocessor]]\n[[Image:Alpha AXP 21064 card1.jpg|thumb|Alpha AXP 21064 bare die mounted on a business card with some statistics]]\n[[Image:KL Compaq DEC ALPHA 21264C.jpg|right|thumb|Compaq Alpha 21264C]]\n'''Alpha''', originally known as '''Alpha AXP''', is a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[reduced instruction set computing]] (RISC) [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) developed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC), designed to replace their [[32-bit]] [[VAX]] [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) ISA.

The new design used most of the basic PRISM concepts, but was re-tuned to allow VMS and VMS programs to run at reasonable speed with no conversion at all. The decision was also made to upgrade the design to a full [[64-bit]] implementation from PRISM's 32-bit, a conversion all of the major RISC vendors were undertaking. Eventually that new architecture became Alpha. The primary Alpha instruction set architects were Richard L. Sites and Richard T. Witek.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/alpha-axp-architecture-reference-manual/sites/978-1-4831-8403-6  |isbn=978-1-4831-8403-6 |title=Alpha AXP Architecture Reference Manual - 2nd Edition\n|author1=Richard L.

The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design in order to deal with the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within the microprocessor design community.\n\nOriginally, the Alpha processors were designated the '''DECchip 21x64''' series,<ref name=X21>{{cite web\n|title=cpu-collection.de - DEC Alpha AXP\n|url=http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=co&l1=DEC&l2=Alpha+AXP\n|quote=The first processors of the Alpha family were designated the DECchip 21064 series (the \"21\" signifying 21st century)}}</ref> with \"DECchip\" replaced in the mid-1990s with \"Alpha\".

Digital intended the architecture to support a one-thousandfold increase in performance over twenty-five years. To ensure this, any architectural feature that impeded multiple instruction issue, clock rate or multiprocessing was removed. As a result, the Alpha does not have:\n\n* [[Branch delay slot]]s\n* Suppressed instructions\n* Byte load or store instructions (later added with the Byte Word Extensions (BWX))<ref>{{cite web\n|title=The Alpha AXP, part 8: Memory access, storing bytes and words\n|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170816-00/?p=96825\n|date=August 16, 2017\n|quote=Dealing with unaligned memory on the Alpha AXP is very annoying}}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|quote=The instructions that comprise the BWX extension are ...\n|title=Alpha 21264 Microprocessor Data Sheet\n|url=https://www.star.bnl.gov/public/daq/HARDWARE/21264_data_sheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Condition codes===\nThe Alpha does not have [[Status register|condition code]]s for integer instructions to remove a potential bottleneck at the condition status register. Instructions resulting in an overflow, such as adding two numbers whose result does not fit in 64 bits, write the 32 or 64 [[least significant bit]]s to the destination register. The carry is generated by performing an unsigned compare on the result with either operand to see if the result is smaller than either operand. If the test was true, the value one is written to the least significant bit of the destination register to indicate the condition.\n\n==Registers==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''DEC Alpha registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:left;\"  | <sup>6</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:right;\" | <sup>4</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>3</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black\" | ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"11\" | '''General-purpose registers''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| R0\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R0\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| R1\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R1\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| R2\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| R29\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R29\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| R30\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R30\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| {{0|{{ns|10}}}} R31 ''(zero)''\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| R31, always zero\n|- \n|colspan=\"11\" | '''Floating-point registers''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| F0\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F0\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| F1\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F1\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| F2\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| \u2022\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| &nbsp;\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| F29\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F29\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| F30\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F30\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| {{0|{{ns|10}}}} F31 ''(zero)''\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| F31, always zero\n|-\n|colspan=\"11\" | '''Program counter'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| {{0|{{ns|8}}}} PC\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"1\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"1\"| 0\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter\n|-\n|colspan=\"11\" | '''Control registers''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| LR0\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''L'''ock '''R'''egister 0 <!--How many bits wide are these registers?-->\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| LR1\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''L'''ock '''R'''egister 1\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"10\"| FPCR\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''FP''' '''C'''ontrol '''R'''egister <!--How many bits wide is this register?-->\n|}\n|}\n\nThe architecture defined a set of 32 integer [[Processor register|register]]s and a set of 32 floating-point registers in addition to a [[program counter]], two lock registers and a floating-point control register (FPCR). It also defined registers that were optional, implemented only if the implementation required them. Lastly, registers for [[PALcode]] were defined.\n\nThe integer registers were denoted by R0 to R31 and floating-point registers were denoted by F0 to F31. The R31 and F31 registers were hardwired to zero and writes to those registers by instructions are ignored. Digital considered using a combined register file, but a split register file was determined to be better as it enabled two-chip implementations to have a register file located on each chip and integer-only implementations to omit the floating-point register file containing the floating point registers. A split register file was also determined to be more suitable for multiple instruction issue due to the reduced number of read and write ports. The number of registers per register file was also considered, with 32 and 64 being contenders. Digital concluded that 32 registers was more suitable as it required less [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] space, which improved clock frequencies. This number of registers was deemed not to be a major issue in respect to performance and future growth, as thirty-two registers could support at least eight-way instruction issue.\n\nThe [[program counter]] is a 64-bit register which contains a longword-aligned virtual byte address, that is, the low two bits of the program counter are always zero. The PC is incremented by four to the address of the next instruction when an instruction is decoded. A lock flag and locked physical address register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support. The floating-point control register (FPCR) is a 64-bit register defined by the architecture intended for use by Alpha implementations with [[IEEE 754]]-compliant floating-point hardware.\n\n==Data types==\nIn the Alpha architecture, a ''[[byte]]'' was defined as an [[8-bit]] [[Data (computing)|datum]] (octet), a ''[[Word (data type)|word]]'' as a [[16-bit]] datum, a ''[[longword]]'' as a [[32-bit]] datum, a ''[[quadword]]'' as a [[64-bit]] datum, and an ''[[octaword]]'' as a [[128-bit]] datum.\n\nThe Alpha architecture originally defined six data types:\n\n* Quadword (64-bit) integer\n* Longword (32-bit) integer\n* IEEE T-floating-point (double precision, 64-bit)\n* IEEE S-floating-point (single precision, 32-bit)\n\nTo maintain a level of compatibility with the [[VAX]], the 32-bit architecture that preceded the Alpha, two other floating-point data types were included:\n\n* VAX G-floating point (double precision, 64-bit)\n* VAX F-floating point (single precision, 32-bit)\n* VAX H-floating point (quad precision, 128-bit) was not supported,<ref>{{cite magazine\n|magazine=DEC Professional  |page=62 |title=Alpha Bits - Migrating To The Future\n|quote=H floating datatypes are unavailable on Alpha |date=August 1992}}</ref> but another 128-bit floating point option, X-floating point, was available on Alpha, but not VAX.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=ftp://ftp.mrynet.com/operatingsystems/VMS/docs/ssb71/6459/6459p002.htm\n|title=Migrating an Application from OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha}}</ref><br>H and X have been described as similar, but not identical. Software emulation for H-floating is available from DEC, as is a source-code level converter named DECmigrate.\n\n==Memory==\nThe Alpha has a 64-bit linear [[virtual address]] space with no memory segmentation. Implementations can implement a smaller virtual address space with a minimum size of 43 bits. Although the unused bits were not implemented in hardware such as [[translation lookaside buffer|TLBs]], the architecture required implementations to check whether they are zero to ensure software compatibility with implementations with a larger (or full) virtual address space.\n\n==Instruction formats==\nThe Alpha ISA has a fixed instruction length of 32 bits. It has six instruction formats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=\"15px\" | 31\n| width=\"15px\" | 30\n| width=\"15px\" | 29\n| width=\"15px\" | 28\n| width=\"15px\" | 27\n| width=\"15px\" | 26\n| width=\"15px\" | 25\n| width=\"15px\" | 24\n| width=\"15px\" | 23\n| width=\"15px\" | 22\n| width=\"15px\" | 21\n| width=\"15px\" | 20\n| width=\"15px\" | 19\n| width=\"15px\" | 18\n| width=\"15px\" | 17\n| width=\"15px\" | 16\n| width=\"15px\" | 15\n| width=\"15px\" | 14\n| width=\"15px\" | 13\n| width=\"15px\" | 12\n| width=\"15px\" | 11\n| width=\"15px\" | 10\n| width=\"15px\" | 9\n| width=\"15px\" | 8\n| width=\"15px\" | 7\n| width=\"15px\" | 6\n| width=\"15px\" | 5\n| width=\"15px\" | 4\n| width=\"15px\" | 3\n| width=\"15px\" | 2\n| width=\"15px\" | 1\n| width=\"15px\" | 0\n| style=\"background-color:#DDDDFF\"| '''Type'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" | Opcode\n| colspan=\"5\" | Ra\n| colspan=\"5\" | Rb\n| colspan=\"3\" | Unused\n| colspan=\"1\" | 0\n| colspan=\"7\" | Function\n| colspan=\"5\" | Rc\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| Integer operate\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" | Opcode\n| colspan=\"5\" | Ra\n| colspan=\"8\" | Literal\n| colspan=\"1\" | 1\n| colspan=\"7\" | Function\n| colspan=\"5\" | Rc\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| Integer operate, literal\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  | Opcode\n| colspan=\"5\"  | Ra\n| colspan=\"5\"  | Rb\n| colspan=\"11\" | Function\n| colspan=\"5\"  | Rc\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| Floating-point operate\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" | Opcode\n| colspan=\"5\" | Ra\n| colspan=\"5\" | Rb\n| colspan=\"16\" | Displacement\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| Memory format\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  | Opcode\n| colspan=\"5\"  | Ra\n| colspan=\"21\" | Displacement\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| Branch format\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  | Opcode\n| colspan=\"26\" | Function\n| style=\"background-color:#EEEEFF\"| CALL_PAL format\n|-\n|}\n\nThe integer operate format is used by integer instructions. It contains a 6-bit opcode field, followed by the Ra field, which specifies the register containing the first operand and the Rb field, specifies the register containing the second operand. Next is a 3-bit field which is unused and reserved. A 1-bit field contains a \"0\", which distinguished this format from the integer literal format. A 7-bit function field follows, which is used in conjunction with the opcode to specify an operation. The last field is the Rc field, which specifies the register which the result of a computation should be written to. The register fields are all 5 bits long, required to address 32 unique locations, the 32 integer registers.\n\nThe integer literal format is used by integer instructions which use a literal as one of the operands. The format is the same as the integer operate format except for the replacement of the 5-bit Rb field and the 3 bits of unused space with an 8-bit literal field which is zero-extended to a 64-bit operand.\n\nThe floating-point operate format is used by floating-point instructions. It is similar to the integer operate format, but has an 11-bit function field made possible by using the literal and unused bits which are reserved in integer operate format.\n\nThe memory format is used mostly by load and store instructions. It has a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra field, a 5-bit Rb field and a 16-bit displacement field.\n\nBranch instructions have a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra field and a 21-bit displacement field. The Ra field specifies a register to be tested by a conditional branch instruction, and if the condition is met, the program counter is updated by adding the contents of the displacement field with the program counter. The displacement field contains a signed integer and if the value of the integer is positive, if the branch is taken then the program counter is incremented. If the value of the integer is negative, then program counter is decremented if the branch is taken. The range of a branch thus is \u00b11 Mi instructions, or \u00b14 MiB. The Alpha Architecture was designed with a large range as part of the architecture's forward-looking goal.\n\nThe CALL_PAL format is used by the <code>CALL_PAL</code> instruction, which is used to call [[PALcode]] subroutines. The format retains the opcode field but replaces the others with a 26-bit function field, which contains an integer specifying a PAL subroutine.\n\n==Instruction set==\n\n===Control instructions===\nThe [[Control flow|control]] instructions consist of conditional and unconditional branches, and jumps. The conditional and unconditional branch instructions use the branch instruction format, while the jump instructions use the memory instruction format.\n\nConditional branches test whether the least significant bit of a register is set or clear, or compare a register as a signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address of the instruction following the conditional branch.\n\nUnconditional branches update the program counter with a new address computed in the same way as conditional branches. They also save the address of the instruction following the unconditional branch to a register. There are two such instructions, and they differ only in the hints provided for the branch prediction hardware.\n\nThere are four jump instructions. These all perform the same operation, saving the address of the instruction following the jump, and providing the program counter with a new address from a register. They differ in the hints provided to the branch prediction hardware. The unused displacement field is used for this purpose.\n\n===Integer arithmetic===\nThe integer arithmetic instructions perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction on longwords and quadwords; and comparison on quadwords. There is no instruction(s) for division as the architects considered the implementation of division in hardware to be adverse to simplicity. In addition to the standard add and subtract instructions, there are ''scaled'' versions. These versions shift the second operand to the left by two or three bits before adding or subtracting. The ''Multiply Longword'' and ''Multiply Quadword'' instructions write the least significant 32 or 64 bits of a 64- or 128-bit result to the destination register, respectively. Since it is useful to obtain the most significant half, the ''Unsigned Multiply Quadword High'' (UMULH) instruction is provided. UMULH is used for implementing multi-precision arithmetic and division algorithms. The concept of a separate instruction for multiplication that returns the most significant half of a result was taken from [[DEC PRISM|PRISM]].\n\nThe instructions that operate on longwords ignore the most significant half of the register and the 32-bit result is sign-extended before it is written to the destination register. By default, the add, multiply, and subtract instructions, with the exception of UMULH and scaled versions of add and subtract, do not trap on overflow. When such functionality is required, versions of these instructions that perform overflow detection and trap on overflow are provided.\n\nThe compare instructions compare two registers or a register and a literal and write '1' to the destination register if the specified condition is true or '0' if not. The conditions are equality, inequality, less than or equal to, and less than. With the exception of the instructions that specify the former two conditions, there are versions that perform signed and unsigned compares.\n\nThe integer arithmetic instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.\n\n===Logical and shift===\nThe logical instructions consist of those for performing [[Bitwise operation|bitwise]] logical operations and [[conditional move]]s on the integer registers. The bitwise logical instructions perform [[Logical conjunction|AND]], [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]], [[Logical NOR|NOR]], [[Logical disjunction|OR]], [[XNOR]], and [[XOR]] between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The specified conditions are equality, inequality, less than or equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform [[Arithmetic shift|arithmetic right shift]], and [[Logical shift|logical left and right shifts]]. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. Logical and shift instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.\n\n==Extensions==\n\n===Byte-Word Extensions (BWX)===\nLater, the Alpha included byte-word extensions, a set of instructions to manipulate 8-bit and 16-bit data types. These instructions were first introduced in the [[Alpha 21164#Alpha 21164 (EV56)|21164A]] (EV56) microprocessor and are present in all subsequent implementations. These instructions performed operations that previously required multiple instructions to implement, which improved code density and the performance of certain applications. BWX also made the emulation of x86 machine code and the writing of [[device driver]]s easier.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/JSSC.1996.542313| title = A 433-MHz 64-b quad-issue RISC microprocessor| journal = IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits| volume = 31| issue = 11| pages = 1687\u20131696| year = 1996| last1 = Gronowski | first1 = P.

''[[Microprocessor Report]]''.</ref> Alpha implementations that implement MVI, in chronological order, are the [[Alpha 21164#Alpha 21164PC|Alpha 21164PC]] (PCA56 and PCA57), [[Alpha 21264]] (EV6) and [[Alpha 21364]] (EV7). Unlike most other SIMD instruction sets of the same period, such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]' [[MDMX]] or [[SPARC]]'s [[Visual Instruction Set]], but like [[PA-RISC]]'s [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]], MVI was a simple instruction set composed of a few instructions that operate on integer data types stored in existing integer registers.\n\nMVI's simplicity was due to two reasons. Firstly, Digital had determined that the [[Alpha 21164]] was already capable of performing [[DVD]] decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in [[MPEG-2]] encoding. The second reason was the requirement to retain the fast cycle times of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation's clock frequency.\n\nMVI consisted of 13 instructions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Mnemonic\n! width=\"360\" | Instruction\n|-\n| <code>MAXSB8</code>\n| Vector Signed Byte Maximum\n|-\n| <code>MAXSW4</code>\n| Vector Signed Word Maximum\n|-\n| <code>MAXUB8</code>\n| Vector Unsigned Byte Maximum\n|-\n| <code>MAXUW4</code>\n| Vector Unsigned Word Maximum\n|-\n| <code>MINSB8</code>\n| Vector Signed Byte Minimum\n|-\n| <code>MINSW4</code>\n| Vector Signed Word Minimum\n|-\n| <code>MINUB8</code>\n| Vector Unsigned Byte Minimum\n|-\n| <code>MINUW4</code>\n| Vector Unsigned Word Minimum\n|-\n| <code>PERR</code>\n| Pixel Error\n|-\n| <code>PKLB</code>\n| Pack Longwords to Bytes\n|-\n| <code>PKWB</code>\n| Pack Words to Bytes\n|-\n| <code>UNPKBL</code>\n| Unpack Bytes to Longwords\n|-\n| <code>UNPKBW</code>\n| Unpack Bytes to Words\n|-\n|}\n\n{{Multimedia extensions}}\n\n===Floating-point Extensions (FIX)===\nFloating-point extensions (FIX) was an extension the Alpha Architecture. It introduced nine instructions for floating-point square-root and for transferring data to and from the integer registers and floating-point registers. The [[Alpha 21264]] (EV6) was the first microprocessor to implement these instructions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Mnemonic\n! width=\"360\" | Instruction\n|-\n| <code>FTOIS</code>\n| Floating-point to Integer Register Move, S_floating\n|-\n| <code>FTOIT</code>\n| Floating-point to Integer Register Move, T_floating\n|-\n| <code>ITOFF</code>\n| Integer to Floating-point Register Move, F_floating\n|-\n| <code>ITOFS</code>\n| Integer to Floating-point Register Move, S_floating\n|-\n| <code>ITOFT</code>\n| Integer to Floating-point Register Move, T_floating\n|-\n| <code>SQRTF</code>\n| Square root F_floating\n|-\n| <code>SQRTG</code>\n| Square root G_floating\n|-\n| <code>SQRTS</code>\n| Square root S_floating\n|-\n| <code>SQRTT</code>\n| Square root T_floating\n|-\n|}\n\n===Count Extensions (CIX)===\nCount Extensions (CIX) was an extension to the architecture which introduced three instructions for counting bits. These instructions were categorized as integer arithmetic instructions. They were first implemented on the [[Alpha 21264#Alpha 21264A|Alpha 21264A]] (EV67).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Mnemonic\n! width=\"360\" | Instruction\n|-\n| <code>CTLZ</code>\n| Count Leading Zero\n|-\n| <code>CTPOP</code>\n| Count Population\n|-\n| <code>CTTZ</code>\n| Count Trailing Zero\n|-\n|}\n\n==Implementations==\nAt the time of its announcement, Alpha was heralded as an architecture for the next 25 years. While this was not to be, Alpha has nevertheless had a reasonably long life. The first version, the '''[[Alpha 21064]]''' (otherwise known as the '''EV4''') was introduced in November 1992 running at up to 192&nbsp;MHz; a slight shrink of the die (the '''EV4S''', shrunk from 0.75&nbsp;\u00b5m to 0.675&nbsp;\u00b5m) ran at 200&nbsp;MHz a few months later. The 64-bit processor was a [[superpipelined]] and [[superscalar]] design, like other RISC designs, but nevertheless outperformed them all and DEC touted it as the world's fastest processor. Careful attention to circuit design, a hallmark of the Hudson design team, like a huge centralized clock circuitry, allowed them to run the CPU at higher speeds, even though the microarchitecture was fairly similar to other RISC chips. In comparison, the less expensive [[Original Intel Pentium (P5 microarchitecture)|Intel Pentium]] ran at 66&nbsp;MHz when it was launched the following spring.\n\nThe '''[[Alpha 21164]]''' or '''EV5''' became available in 1995 at processor frequencies of up to 333&nbsp;MHz. In July 1996 the line was speed bumped to 500&nbsp;MHz, in March 1998 to 666&nbsp;MHz. Also in 1998 the '''[[Alpha 21264]]''' ('''EV6''') was released at 450&nbsp;MHz, eventually reaching (in 2001 with the '''21264C'''/'''EV68CB''') 1.25&nbsp;GHz. In 2003, the '''[[Alpha 21364]]''' or '''EV7''' ''Marvel'' was launched, essentially an EV68 core with four 1.6 GB/s<ref>In the context of data transfer, 1 GB is used to mean 1 billion bytes</ref> inter-processor communication links for improved [[multiprocessor]] system performance, running at 1 or 1.15&nbsp;GHz.\n\nIn 1996, the production of Alpha chips was licensed to [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung Electronics Company]]. Following the purchase of Digital by [[Compaq]] the majority of the Alpha products were placed with API NetWorks, Inc. (previously Alpha Processor Inc.), a private company funded by Samsung and Compaq. In October 2001, [[Microway]] became the exclusive sales and service provider of API NetWorks' Alpha-based product line.\n\nOn June 25, 2001, Compaq announced that Alpha would be phased out by 2004 in favor of [[Intel]]'s [[Itanium]], canceled the planned '''[[Alpha 21464|EV8]]''' chip, and sold all Alpha intellectual property to [[Intel]].<ref name=\"zdnet-compaq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/alpha-proved-costly-for-compaq-3002090197/|title=Alpha proved costly for Compaq|last=Popovich|first=Ken|date=2001-06-28|work=www.zdnet.com|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2016-03-02}}</ref> HP, new owner of Compaq later the same year, announced that development of the Alpha series would continue for a few more years, including the release of a 1.3&nbsp;GHz EV7 variant called the '''EV7z'''. This would be the final iteration of Alpha, the 0.13&nbsp;\u00b5m '''EV79''' also being canceled.\n\nAlpha was also implemented in the ''Piranha'', a research prototype developed by Compaq's Corporate Research and Nonstop Hardware Development groups at the Western Research Laboratory and Systems Research Center. ''Piranha'' was a [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] design for [[transaction processing]] workloads that contained eight simple cores. It was described at the 27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture in June 2000.<ref>Luiz Andr\u00e9 Barroso, Kourosh Gharachorloo, Robert McNamara, Andreas Nowatzyk, Shaz Qadeer, Barton Sano, Scott Smith, Robert Stets, and Ben Verghese (2000). \"Piranha: A Scalable Architecture Based on Single-Chip Multiprocessing\".

Note that the SPEC results claim to report the measured performance of a whole computer system (CPU, bus, memory, compiler optimizer), not just the CPU. Also note that the benchmark and scale changed from 1992 to 1995. However, the figures give a rough impression of the performance of the Alpha architecture (64-bit), compared with the contemporary HP (64-bit) and Intel-based offerings (32-bit). Perhaps the most obvious trend is that while Intel could always get reasonably close to Alpha in integer performance, in floating point performance the difference was considerable. On the other side, HP ([[PA-RISC]]) is also reasonably close to Alpha, but these CPUs are running at significantly lower clock rates (MHz). The tables lack two important values: the power consumption and the price of a CPU.\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:98%\"\n! width=\"150\"| System\n! width=\"80\"| CPU\n! width=\"30\"| MHz\n! width=\"40\"| integer\n! width=\"50\"| floating point\n|-\n|+SPEC benchmark 1995 performance comparison (using ''SPECint95'' and ''SPECfp95'' results [http://www.spec.org/cpu95/results/])\n|-\n!AlphaServer 8400 5/350\n|21164 (EV5)||350||10.1||14.2\n|-\n!Intel Alder System (200&nbsp;MHz, 256&nbsp;KB L2)  \n|Pentium Pro||200||8.9||6.75\n|-\n!HP 9000 C160\n|PA 8000||160||10.4||16.3\n|-\n|}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:98%\"\n! width=\"150\"| System\n! width=\"80\"| CPU\n! width=\"30\"| MHz\n! width=\"40\"| integer\n! width=\"50\"| floating point\n|-\n|+2000 performance comparison (using ''SPECint95'' and ''SPECfp95'' results)\n|-\n!AlphaServer ES40 6/833\n|21264 (EV6)||833||50.0||100.0\n|-\n!Intel VC820 motherboard\n|Pentium III||1000||46.8||31.9\n|-\n!HP 9000 C3600 \n|PA-8600||552||42.1||64.0\n|-\n|}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Alpha-based systems==\nThe first generation of DEC Alpha-based systems comprised the [[DEC 3000 AXP]] series workstations and low-end servers, [[DEC 4000 AXP]] series mid-range servers, and [[DEC 7000/10000 AXP|DEC 7000 AXP and 10000 AXP]] series high-end servers. The DEC 3000 AXP systems used the same [[TURBOchannel]] bus as the previous [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-based DECstation models, whereas the 4000 was based on [[Futurebus|FutureBus+]] and the 7000/10000 shared an architecture with corresponding [[VAX]] models.\n\nDEC also produced a [[personal computer|PC]]-like Alpha workstation with an [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] bus, the [[DECpc AXP 150]] (codename \"Jensen\", also known as the DEC 2000 AXP). This was the first Alpha system to support [[Windows NT]]. DEC later produced Alpha versions of their Celebris XL and [[Digital Personal Workstation]] PC lines, with 21164 processors.\n\nDigital also produced [[single board computer]]s based on the [[VMEbus]] for embedded and industrial use. The first generation included the 21068-based AXPvme 64 and AXPvme 64LC, and the 21066-based AXPvme 160. These were introduced on March 1, 1994. Later models such as the AXPvme 100, AXPvme 166 and AXPvme 230 were based on the 21066A processor, while the Alpha VME 4/224 and Alpha VME 4/288 were based on the 21064A processor. The last models, the Alpha VME 5/352 and Alpha VME 5/480, were based on the 21164 processor.\n\nThe 21066 chip was used in the [[DEC Multia]] VX40/41/42 compact workstation and the ALPHAbook 1 laptop from Tadpole Technology.\n\nIn 1994, DEC launched a new range of [[AlphaStation]] and [[AlphaServer]] systems. These used 21064 or 21164 processors and introduced the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus, [[VGA]]-compatible [[frame buffer]]s and [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]]-style keyboards and mice. The AlphaServer 8000 series superseded the DEC 7000/10000 AXP and also employed XMI and FutureBus+ buses.\n\nThe AlphaStation XP1000 was the first workstation based on the 21264 processor. Later AlphaServer/Station models based on the 21264 were categorised into ''DS'' (departmental server), ''ES'' (enterprise server) or ''GS'' (global server) families.\n\nThe final 21364 chip was used in the AlphaServer ES47, ES80 and GS1280 models and the AlphaStation ES47.\n\nA number of [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] [[motherboard]]s were produced by DEC, such as the 21066 and 21068-based AXPpci 33 \"NoName\", which was part of a major push into the OEM market by the company,<ref>Reinhardt Krause. \"DEC launching Alpha board push\". Electronic News, April 4, 1994.</ref> the 21164-based AlphaPC 164 and AlphaPC 164LX, the 21164PC-based AlphaPC 164SX and AlphaPC 164RX and the 21264-based AlphaPC 264DP. Several third parties such as Samsung and API also produced OEM motherboards such as the API UP1000 and UP2000.\n\nTo assist third parties in developing hardware and software for the platform, DEC produced Evaluation Boards, such as the EB64+ and EB164 for the Alpha 21064A and 21164 microprocessors respectively.\n\nThe 21164 and 21264 processors were used by [[NetApp]] in various [[network-attached storage]] systems, while the 21064 and 21164 processors were used by [[Cray]] in their [[Cray T3D|T3D]] and [[Cray T3E|T3E]] [[massively parallel]] supercomputers.\n\n===Supercomputers===\nThe fastest supercomputers based on Alpha processors:{{citation needed|reason=Need a reference for the claim that the SW26010 and SW1600 are Alpha processors|date=April 2017}}\n\n* [[Sunway TaihuLight]] at Chinese National Supercomputing Center in [[Wuxi]].

Thus, an ordinary dagger designed for civilian sale and use is only a fighting knife, while the U.S. Army M3 trench knife is both a combat knife ''and'' a fighting knife.</ref> and many cultures have used adorned daggers in ritual and ceremonial contexts. The distinctive shape and historic usage of the dagger have made it iconic and symbolic. A dagger in the modern sense is a weapon designed for close-proximity combat or self-defense; due to its use in historic weapon assemblages, it has associations with assassination and murders. Double-edged knives, however, play different sorts of roles in different social contexts. In some cultures, they are neither a weapon nor a tool, but a potent symbol of manhood; in others they are ritual objects used in body modifications such as circumcision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frieman|first1=Catherine|title=Flint Daggers in Prehistoric Europe|date=1950|publisher=Oxbox Books|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\nA wide variety of thrusting knives have been described as daggers, including knives that feature only a single cutting edge, such as the European [[rondel dagger]] or the Persian [[pesh-kabz]], or, in some instances, no cutting edge at all, such as the [[stiletto]] of the Renaissance.

The [[Late Middle English|Middle English]] ''dagger'' is used from the 1380s.\n\nDuring this time, the dagger was often employed in the role of a [[companion weapon|secondary defense weapon]] in [[close combat]].  The knightly dagger evolved into the larger [[baselard]] knife in the 14th century. During the 14th century, it became fairly common for knights to fight on foot to strengthen the infantry defensive line. This necessitated greater dagger usage. At Agincourt (1415) archers used them to dispatch dismounted knights by thrusting the narrow blades through helmet vents and other apertures.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Logan|title=Daggers and Bayonets|date=1999|publisher=Spellmount ltd.|location=United Kingdom|page=24}}</ref> The baselard was considered an intermediate between a short sword and a long dagger, and became popular also as a civilian weapon.  [[Sloane MS]]. 2593 (c. 1400) records a song satirizing the use of oversized baselard knives as fashion accessories.<ref>''prenegarde prenegarde, thus bere I myn baselard'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=s9iobZUO8nUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ed. Pickering 1836].</ref>\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, knives with blade designs that emphasized thrusting attacks, such as the [[stiletto]], became increasingly popular, and some thrusting knives commonly referred to as 'daggers' ceased to have a cutting edge.  This was a response to the deployment of heavy armor, such as [[maille]] and [[plate armour]], where cutting attacks were ineffective and focus was on thrusts with narrow blades to punch through mail or aim at armour plate intersections (or the eye slits of the helmet visor).  These late medieval thrusting weapons are sometimes classed by the shape of their hilt as either [[roundel dagger|roundel]], [[bollock dagger|bollock]] or [[Ear dagger|ear]] daggers.\nThe term ''dagger'' is coined in this time, as are the [[Early Modern German]] equivalents ''[[:wikt:Dolch|dolch]]'' (''tolch'') and ''[[:wikt:Degen#Etymology 2|degen]]'' (''tegen'').\nIn the [[German school of fencing]], [[Johannes Liechtenauer]] ([[3227a|Ms. 3227a]]) and his successors (specifically Andres Lignizer in [[Cod. 44 A 8]]) taught fighting with the dagger.<ref>{{cite book|title =Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century |author =Egerton Castle|publisher =Courier Dover Publications|year=2003|page=246|ISBN = 978-0-486-42826-0}}</ref>\n\nThese techniques in some respects resemble modern [[knife fighting]], but emphasized thrusting strokes almost exclusively, instead of slashes and cuts.  When used offensively, a standard attack frequently employed the reverse or [[icepick grip]], stabbing downward with the blade to increase thrust and penetrative force.  This was done primarily because the blade point frequently had to penetrate or push apart an opponent's steel [[chain mail]] or [[plate armor]] in order to inflict an injury.  The disadvantage of employing the medieval dagger in this manner was that it could easily be blocked by a variety of techniques, most notably by a block with the weaponless arm while simultaneously attacking with a weapon held in the right hand.  Another disadvantage was the reduction in effective blade reach to the opponent when using a reverse grip.  As the wearing of armor fell out of favor, dagger fighting techniques began to evolve which emphasized the use of the dagger with a conventional or forward grip, while the reverse or icepick grip was retained when attacking an unsuspecting opponent from behind, such as in an assassination.\n\n==Renaissance and Early Modern era==\n{{further|Stiletto|Parrying dagger|Dirk}}\n[[File:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7892 full.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger, [[Louvre]].]]\n[[File:Dagger with Zoomorphic Hilt MET DP253146.jpg|thumb|left|''Dagger with Zoomorphic Hilt'', ca. 16th century, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dagger_with_Zoomorphic_Hilt_MET_DP253146.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]\n\nThe dagger was very popular as a fencing and personal defense weapon in 17th- and 18th-century Spain, where it was referred to as the ''daga'' or ''pu\u00f1al''.<ref>{{cite book|title =Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values  |author =Steve Shackleford|publisher =Krause Publications|year=2010|page=246|ISBN = 978-1-4402-0387-9 }}</ref>  During the Renaissance Age the dagger was used as part of everyday dress, and daggers were the only weapon commoners were allowed to carry on their person.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval and Renaissance Dagger Combat|author= Jason Vail |publisher= Paladin Press|year= 2006 |page=16|ISBN = 978-1-58160-517-4 }}</ref>\nIn English, the terms ''poniard'' and  ''dirk'' are loaned during the late 16th to early 17th century, the latter in the spelling ''dork, durk'' (presumably via Low German, Dutch or Scandinavian ''dolk, dolch'', ultimately from a West Slavic ''tulich''), the modern spelling ''dirk'' dating to 18th-century [[Scots language|Scots]].\n\nBeginning with the 17th century, another form of dagger\u2014the [[plug bayonet]] and later the socket [[bayonet]]\u2014was used to convert [[musket]]s and other [[long gun|longarms]] into [[spear]]s by mounting them on the barrel. They were periodically used for eating; the arm was also used for a variety of other tasks such as mending boots, house repairs and farm jobs.

They also replaced the sabres worn by officers, which were too long and clumsy for trench warfare. They were worn with pride as a sign of having served front line duty.\n\nDaggers achieved public notoriety in the 20th century as ornamental uniform regalia during the Fascist dictatorships of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. The resurgence of these dress daggers and accoutrements in post-World War I Germany gave a much needed boost to the flagging fortunes of the metalworking center Solingen. Dress daggers were used by several other countries as well, including Japan, but never to the same extent as those worn by the military and political bodies of the Third Reich or Fascist Italy. As combat equipment they were carried by many infantry and [[commando]] forces during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  British Commando and other elite units were issued an especially slender dagger, the [[Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife]], developed by [[William E. Fairbairn]] and [[Eric A.

One of the more popular forms of the concealable dagger is the ''[[boot knife]]''.

Daggers may be associated with deception, stealth, and/or treachery due to the ease of concealment and surprise that someone could inflict with one on an unsuspecting victim, and indeed many [[assassinations]] have been carried out with the use of a dagger, including that of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref>{{cite book|title =The History That Was Never Spoken  |author =David Gray |publisher =Lulu|year=2006|page=87|ISBN = 978-1-4116-1703-2 }}</ref>   A [[cloak and dagger]] attack is one in which a deceitful, traitorous, or concealed enemy attacks a person.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Dickens | first1 = Charles | title = Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty | year = 1841 | publisher = Chapman & Hall | location = London | isbn = 0-14-043728-2 | pages = 203}}</ref>  On the other hand, for some cultures and military organizations the dagger symbolizes courage and daring in combat.<ref>{{cite book|title =The illustrated encyclopedia of military insignia of the 20th century: a comprehensive A-Z guide to the badges, patches, and embellishments of the world's armed forces |author =Guido Rosignoli  |publisher =Stanley Paul|year=1987|page=44 |ISBN = 978-0-09-172670-6 }}</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\nDagger reputation was tainted by its periodic use, or alleged employment, in the commission of disreputable, secretive and unsavoury deeds. Perhaps these are exaggerated; however, it became associated with assassinations performed when the concealed weapon was suddenly flourished and used to kill. Consequently, it developed connotations with murky, cowardly assaults in dark alleys, upon shadowy staircases, and of hired murderers emerging from concealment to stab innocent, sleeping victims.<ref name=\"Daggers and Bayonets\">{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Logan|title=Daggers and Bayonets|date=1999|publisher=Spellmount ltd.|location=United Kingdom|page=54}}</ref>\n\nTo a degree, some antipathy towards the dagger has remained unchanged up to modern times. This is perhaps, partly due to the periodic, contemporary broadcasting of bloodthirsty films and television series depicting gangsters employing the stiletto daggers. History is punctuated with accounts of daggers being used in assassinations and coup d'\u00e9tat attempts. On March 15, 44BC, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] was assassinated by a large group of conspirators who stabbed him repeatedly with their daggers. This took place in Rome in a room behind the [[Theatre of Pompey]] which was being used for government business whilst the Senate was being rebuilt. \n\nTo some degree, the dagger regained a little social prestige during the rapier age when personal combat became less brutal. Its involvement in this formalized, regulated martial endeavor did something to restore its reputation. When its advantages and purpose eventually declined and weapon carrying ceased, the dagger was saved from obsolescence by its retention as a field sports gadget. In the nineteenth century the custom of wearing a general purpose knife practically ceased and the hunting knife became a specialized instrument. However, its combat and military traditions were incorporated in the bayonet weapon which has continued in use until the present day.<ref name=\"Daggers and Bayonets\"/>\n\n==Art knives==\n[[File:Art Knives by Buster Warenski.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buster Warenski]] dagger]]\nDaggers are a popular form of what is known as the \"art knife\", due in part to the symmetry of the blade.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Images of Steel|first= Ethen |last=Edwards|journal= Blade Magazine|pages=40\u201343|year= 1990|issue=4|volume=27 }}</ref>  One of the most famous examples is knifemaker [[Buster Warenski]]'s replication of the gold dagger found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb.

Members of the order, who are referred to as ''Dominicans'', generally carry the letters ''OP'' after their names, standing for ''Ordinis Praedicatorum'', meaning ''of the Order of Preachers''. Membership in the order includes [[friar]]s,<ref>The word ''friar'' is etymologically related to the word for ''brother'' in [[Latin]]. {{cite web| title = friar \u2013 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary| accessdate = 2008-10-21| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/friar}}</ref> [[nuns]], active sisters, and affiliated [[Laity|lay]] or secular Dominicans  (formerly known as [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|tertiaries]], though recently there has been a growing number of associates who are unrelated to the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|tertiaries]]).\n\nFounded to preach the [[The gospel|Gospel]] and to oppose [[heresy]], the teaching activity of the order and its scholastic organisation placed the Preachers in the forefront of the intellectual life of the [[Middle Ages]].

[[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]], [[Perugia]].]]\n\nA number of other names have been used to refer to both the order and its members.\n* In England and other countries the Dominican friars are referred to as \"Black Friars\" because of the black ''cappa'' or cloak they wear over their white [[Religious habit|habits]].<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \"Black friar\"</ref> Dominicans were \"Blackfriars\", as opposed to \"Whitefriars\" (i.e., [[Carmelites]]) or \"Greyfriars\" (i.e., [[Franciscan]]s). They are also distinct from the Augustinian Friars (the [[Austin friars]]) who wear a similar habit.\n* In France, the Dominicans were known as \"Jacobins\" because their [[Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Jacques|convent]] in [[Paris]] was attached to the [[Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Jacques|Church of Saint-Jacques]], now disappeared, on the way to [[Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas]], which belonged to the Italian [[Order of Saint James of Altopascio]]<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \"Jacobin\"(1)</ref> ([[James the Less|St. James]]) ''Sanctus Iacobus'' in Latin.\n* Their identification as Dominicans gave rise to the pun that they were the \"Domini canes\", or \"Hounds of the Lord\".<ref>The reference to \"[[hound]]s\" draws on the tradition that Saint Dominic's mother, while pregnant with him, had a vision of a black and white dog with a torch in its mouth; wherever the dog went, it set fire to the earth. It was explained that the vision was fulfilled when Dominic and his followers went forth, clad in black and white, setting fire to the earth with the [[Gospel]]. In English, the word \"hound\" has two further meanings that may be drawn upon. A hound is loyal, and the Dominicans have a reputation as obedient servants of the faith.</ref>\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:Doctrina-cristiana.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Dominic on the front cover of ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' catechism in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] with an eight-pointed star (a symbol of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]) over his head.

Instead, they travelled among the people, taking as their examples the apostles of the primitive Church. Out of this ideal emerged two orders of mendicant friars: one, the Friars Minor, was led by [[Francis of Assisi]]; the other, the Friars Preachers, by [[Dominic of Guzman]]. Like his contemporary, Francis, Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization, and the quick growth of the Dominicans and [[Franciscan]]s during their first century of existence confirms that the [[Mendicant orders|orders of mendicant friars]] met a need.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |isbn=0-8014-9247-5 |last=Little |first=Lester K. |title=Religious Poverty and the Profit Economy in Medieval Europe |date=March 1983}} argues the Dominicans and other mendicant orders were an adaptation to the rise of the profit economy in medieval Europe.</ref>\n\nDominic sought to establish a new kind of order, one that would bring the dedication and systematic education of the older monastic orders like the [[Benedictine]]s to bear on the religious problems of the burgeoning population of cities, but with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. The Order of Preachers was founded in response to a then perceived need for informed preaching.<ref>[https://dominicanfriars.org/about/history-dominican-friars/ \"History of the Dominican Friars\", Dominican Friars Foundation]</ref> Dominic's new order was to be trained to preach in the [[vernacular]] languages.\n\nDominic inspired his followers with loyalty to learning and virtue, a deep recognition of the spiritual power of worldly deprivation and the religious state, and a highly developed governmental structure.<ref name = \"ancdwq\">Hinnebusch, The History of the Dominican Order, 7.</ref> At the same time, Dominic inspired the members of his order to develop a \"mixed\" spirituality. They were both active in preaching, and contemplative in study, prayer and meditation. The brethren of the Dominican Order were urban and learned, as well as contemplative and mystical in their spirituality. While these traits affected the women of the order, the nuns especially absorbed the latter characteristics and made those characteristics their own. In England, the Dominican nuns blended these elements with the defining characteristics of English Dominican spirituality and created a spirituality and collective personality that set them apart.\n\n===Saint Dominic===\n{{Main|Saint Dominic}}\n[[File:Santo Domingo en oraci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Dominic]] (1170\u20131221), portrait by [[El Greco]], about 1600]]\nAs an adolescent, he had a particular love of theology and the Scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality.<ref>Hinnebusch, The History of the Dominican Order, 17.</ref> During his studies in [[Palencia]], Spain, he experienced a dreadful famine, prompting Dominic to sell all of his beloved books and other equipment to help his neighbors.<ref>Tugwell, 53</ref> After he completed his studies, Bishop Martin Bazan and Prior Diego d'Achebes appointed Dominic to the cathedral chapter and he became a [[Canon Regular]] under the [[Rule of Saint Augustine]] and the Constitutions for the cathedral church of [[Osma]]. At the age of twenty-four or twenty-five, he was ordained to the priesthood.<ref>Hinnebusch, ''The History of the Dominican Order'', 19.</ref>\n\n===Albigensians===\nIn 1203, Dominic joined Prior [[Diego de Acebo]] on an embassy to Denmark for the monarchy of Spain, to arrange the marriage between the son of King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] and a niece of King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05106a.htm O'Connor, John Bonaventure. \"St. Dominic.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 23 December 2017</ref> At that time the south of France was the stronghold of the [[Cathar]] or [[Albigensian]] movement, named after the Duke of [[Albi]], a Cathar sympathiser and opponent to the subsequent [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229). Dominic was fired by a reforming zeal after they encountered Albigensian Christians at [[Toulouse]].\n\nThe Albigensians were a [[Christian heresy|heretical]] [[gnostic]] sect, holding that matter was evil and only spirit was good; this was a fundamental challenge to the notion of [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], central to [[Roman Catholic theology]]. Dominic saw the need for a response that would attempt to sway members of the Albigensian movement back to mainstream Christian thought.\n\nPrior Diego saw immediately one of the paramount reasons for the spread of the unorthodox movement: the representatives of the Holy Church acted and moved with an offensive amount of pomp and ceremony. On the other hand, the Cathars lived in a state of self-sacrifice that was widely appealing. For these reasons, Prior Diego suggested that the papal legates begin to live a reformed apostolic life. The legates agreed to change if they could find a strong leader. The prior took up the challenge, and he and Dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the Albigensians.<ref>Hinnebusch, ''The History of the Dominican Order'', p. 23.</ref> Despite this particular mission, in winning the Albigensians over by persuasion Dominic met limited success, \"for though in his ten years of preaching a large number of converts were made, it has to be said that the results were not such as had been hoped for\".<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Dominic, Saint |volume=8 |pages=401\u2013402 |first=Edward Cuthbert |last=Butler}}</ref>\n\n===Dominican convent established===\nDominic became the spiritual father to several Albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith, and in 1206 he established them in a convent in [[Prouille]], near [[Toulouse]].<ref>[http://www.op.org/en/content/st-dominic \"St. Dominic\", Order of Preachers]</ref> This convent would become the foundation of the Dominican nuns, thus making the Dominican nuns older than the Dominican friars.

Its purpose was revolutionary in the pastoral ministry of the Catholic Church. These priests were organized and well trained in religious studies. Dominic needed a framework\u2014a rule\u2014to organize these components. The Rule of Saint Augustine was an obvious choice for the Dominican Order, according to Dominic's successor, Jordan of Saxony, because it lent itself to the \"salvation of souls through preaching\".<ref>Hinnebusch, ''The History of the Dominican Order'', 44.</ref> By this choice, however, the Dominican brothers designated themselves not monks, but canons-regular. They could practice ministry and common life while existing in individual poverty.<ref>Hinnebusch, ''The History of the Dominican Order'', 44. See also Tugwell, 55.</ref>\n\nDominic's education at Palencia gave him the knowledge he needed to overcome the [[Manichaeism|Manicheans]]. With charity, the other concept that most defines the work and spirituality of the order, study became the method most used by the Dominicans in working to defend the Church against the perils that hounded it, and also of enlarging its authority over larger areas of the known world.<ref>Bennett, 52.</ref> In Dominic's thinking, it was impossible for men to preach what they did not or could not understand. When the brethren left Prouille, then, to begin their apostolic work, Dominic sent [[Matthew of Paris]] to establish a school near the University of Paris. This was the first of many Dominican schools established by the brethren, some near large universities throughout Europe. The women of the order also established schools for the children of the local gentry.\n\nThe Order of Preachers was approved in December 1216 and January 1217 by [[Pope Honorius III]] in the [[papal bull]]s ''[[Religiosam vitam]]'' and ''[[Nos attendentes]]''.  On January 21, 1217, Honorius issued the bull ''Gratiarum omnium''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2X-DsLOjoMIC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22Honorius#v=onepage&q=%22Honorius&f=false|via=Google Books|accessdate=2011-02-07|title=Omnia disce: medieval studies in memory of Leonard Boyle, O.P.|first1=Anne|last1=Duggan|first2=Joan|last2=Greatrex|first3=Brenda|last3=Bolton|first4=Leonard E.|last4=Boyle|year=2005|p=202}}</ref> recognizing Saint Dominic's followers as an order dedicated to study and universally authorized to preach, a power formerly reserved to local episcopal authorization.<ref>J.-P.

The Convent of St. Jacques, would eventually become the order's first ''[[studium generale]]''. [[Saint Dominic]] was to establish similar foundations at other university towns of the day, [[Bologna]] in 1218, [[Palencia]] and [[Montpellier]] in 1220, and [[Oxford]] just before his death in 1221.<ref>Weisheipl, James A., \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20101229185458/http://www.domcentral.org/study/opstudy.htm  The Place of Study In the Ideal of St. Dominic]\", Dominican House of Studies River Forest, Illinois, 30 August 1960</ref>\n \n[[File:Saint Thomas Aquinas Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|right|thumb|Doctor Angelicus, [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (1225\u20131274), considered by the Catholic Church to be its greatest medieval theologian, is girded by angels with a mystical belt of purity after his [[Chastity|proof of chastity]].]]\nIn 1219 Pope Honorius III invited Saint Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman [[basilica]] of [[Santa Sabina]], which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of [[San Sisto Vecchio]] which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218 intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic's guidance.

Before that concession the Pope said that the friars had no hospitium in Rome. At that time St. Sixtus was no longer theirs; Conrad of Metz could not have alluded to Saint Sixtus, therefore, when he said in 1221: \"the Pope has conferred on them a house in Rome\" (Laurent no. 136).

In the 20th century the college would be relocated to the convent of [[Santi Domenico e Sisto|Saints Dominic and Sixtus]] and would be transformed into the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].\n\nThe Dominican friars quickly spread, including to England, where they appeared in [[Oxford]] in 1221.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth O.

Morgan |title=The Oxford History of Britain |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=179 |isbn=0-19-285202-7}}\n</ref> In the 13th century the order reached all classes of Christian society, fought [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[Schism (religion)|schism]], and [[paganism]] by word and book, and by its missions to the north of Europe, to Africa, and Asia passed beyond the frontiers of Christendom. Its schools spread throughout the entire Church; its doctors wrote monumental works in all branches of knowledge, including the extremely important [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Its members included popes, cardinals, bishops, legates, inquisitors, confessors of princes, ambassadors, and ''paciarii'' (enforcers of the peace decreed by popes or councils).\n\nThe order's origins in battling heterodoxy influenced its later development and reputation. Many later Dominicans battled heresy as part of their apostolate. Indeed, many years after St. Dominic reacted to the Cathars, the first [[Spanish Inquisition|Grand Inquistor of Spain]], [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]], would be drawn from the Dominican Order. The order was appointed by [[Pope Gregory IX]] the duty to carry out the Inquisition.<ref>{{cite web |last=Van Helden |first=Al |title=The Inquisition |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/chr/inquisition.html |work=The Galileo Project |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> Torture was not regarded as a mode of punishment, but purely as a means of eliciting the truth. In his Papal Bull ''[[Ad extirpanda]]'' of 1252, Pope Innocent IV authorised the Dominicans' use of torture under prescribed circumstances.<ref>Bl\u00f6tzer, Joseph. \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm Inquisition]\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 December 2017</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the order produced changes. A smaller emphasis on doctrinal activity favoured the development here and there of the [[ascetic]] and [[contemplative]] life and there sprang up, especially in Germany and Italy, the mystical movement with which the names of [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Heinrich Suso]], [[Johannes Tauler]], and [[Catherine of Siena|Saint Catherine of Siena]] are associated. (See [[German mysticism]], which has also been called \"Dominican mysticism\".) This movement was the prelude to the reforms undertaken, at the end of the century, by [[Raimondo delle Vigne|Raymond of Capua]], and continued in the following century. At the same time the order found itself face to face with the [[Renaissance]]. It struggled against pagan tendencies in [[Renaissance humanism]], in Italy through Dominici and Savonarola, in Germany through the theologians of [[Cologne]] but it also furnished humanism with such advanced writers as [[Francesco Colonna]] (probably the writer of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'') and [[Matteo Bandello]]. Many Dominicans took part in the artistic activity of the age, the most prominent being [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Fra Bartolomeo]].<ref name=Mandonnet/>\n\n====Women====\nAlthough Dominic and the early brethren had instituted female Dominican houses at Prouille and other places by 1227, houses of women attached to the Order became so popular that some of the friars had misgivings about the increasing demands of female religious establishments on their time and resources. Nonetheless, women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland.<ref name = \"vyknsb\">Lee, ''Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality'', 13.</ref> Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as [[Beguines]], that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in the order by 1358. After that year, the number lessened considerably due to the Black Death.<ref>Lee, ''Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality'', 14.</ref>\n\nIn places besides Germany, convents were founded as retreats from the world for women of the upper classes. These were original projects funded by wealthy patrons, including other women. Among these was Countess Margaret of Flanders who established the monastery of Lille, while [[Ch\u00e2teau of Val-Duchesse#History|Val-Duchesse]] at Oudergem near Brussels was built with the wealth of Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (1262).<ref>Hinnebusch, History of the Dominican Order, 337.</ref>\n\nFemale houses differed from male Dominican houses in that they were enclosed. The sisters chanted the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and kept all the monastic observances.<ref>Lee, ''Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality'', 70\u201373.</ref> The nuns lived under the authority of the general and provincial chapters of the order. They shared in all the applicable privileges of the order. The friars served as their confessors, priests, teachers and spiritual mentors.<ref>Hinnebsch, ''History of the Dominican Order'', 382</ref>\n\nWomen could be professed to the Dominican religious life at the age of thirteen. The formula for profession contained in the Constitutions of Montargis Priory (1250) requires that nuns pledge obedience to God, the Blessed Virgin, their prioress and her successors according to the Rule of Saint Augustine and the institute of the order, until death. The clothing of the sisters consisted of a white tunic and scapular, a leather belt, a black mantle, and a black veil. Candidates to profession were questioned to reveal whether they were actually married women who had merely separated from their husbands. Their intellectual abilities were also tested. Nuns were to be silent in places of prayer, the cloister, the dormitory, and refectory. Silence was maintained unless the prioress granted an exception for a specific cause. Speaking was allowed in the common parlor, but it was subordinate to strict rules, and the prioress, subprioress or other senior nun had to be present.<ref>Lee, ''Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality'', 30.</ref>\n\nAs well as sewing, embroidery and other genteel pursuits, the nuns participated in a number of intellectual activities, including reading and discussing pious literature.<ref>Lee, ''Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality'', 31.</ref> In the Strassburg monastery of Saint Margaret, some of the nuns could converse fluently in Latin. Learning still had an elevated place in the lives of these religious. In fact, Margarette Reglerin, a daughter of a wealthy Nuremberg family, was dismissed from a convent because she did not have the ability or will to learn.<ref>Hinnebusch, ''History of the Dominican Order'', 384</ref>\n\n====English Province====\nIn England, the Dominican Province began at the second general chapter of the Dominican Order in Bologna during the spring of 1221. Dominic dispatched twelve friars to England under the guidance of their English prior, Gilbert of Fresney. They landed in Dover on August 5, 1221. The province officially came into being at its first provincial chapter in 1230.<ref>William Hinnebusch. ''The Early English Friars Preachers'', 1.</ref>\n\nThe English Province was a component of the international order from which it obtained its laws, direction, and instructions. It was also, however, a group of Englishmen. Its direct supervisors were from England, and the members of the English Province dwelt and labored in English cities, towns, villages, and roadways. English and European ingredients constantly came in contact. The international side of the province's existence influenced the national, and the national responded to, adapted, and sometimes constrained the international.<ref>William Hinnebusch. ''The Early English Friars Preachers'', 2.</ref>\n\nThe first Dominican site in England was at Oxford, in the parishes of St. Edward and St. Adelaide.<ref>William Hinnebusch. ''The Early English Friars Preachers'', 4.</ref> The friars built an oratory to the Blessed Virgin Mary<ref>Hinnebusch, ''Early English Friars Preachers'', 6. There was a dispute over this oratory in 1228.</ref> and by 1265, the brethren, in keeping with their devotion to study, began erecting a school. Actually, the Dominican brothers likely began a school immediately after their arrival, as priories were legally schools.<ref>Hinnebusch, ''Early English Friars Preachers'', 8\u20139.</ref> Information about the schools of the English Province is limited, but a few facts are known. Much of the information available is taken from visitation records.<ref>Maura O'Carroll, ''The Educational Organisation of the Dominicans in England and Wales 1221\u20131348: A Multidisciplinary Approach'', Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum 50 (1980): 32.</ref> The \"visitation\" was a section of the province through which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies to the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and Wales\u2014Oxford, London, Cambridge and York.<ref>O'Carroll, 33</ref> All Dominican students were required to learn grammar, old and new logic, natural philosophy and theology. Of all of the curricular areas, however, theology was the most important. This is not surprising when one remembers Dominic's zeal for it.<ref>O'Carroll, 57.</ref>\n\n[[Dartford Priory]] was established long after the primary period of monastic foundation in England had ended. It emulated, then, the monasteries found in Europe\u2014mainly France and German\u2014as well as the monastic traditions of their English Dominican brothers. The first nuns to inhabit Dartford were sent from Poissy Priory in France.<ref name = \"vyknsb\"/> Even on the eve of the Dissolution, Prioress Jane Vane wrote to Cromwell on behalf of a postulant, saying that though she had not actually been professed, she was professed in her heart and in the eyes of God. This is only one such example of dedication. Profession in Dartford Priory seems, then, to have been made based on personal commitment, and one's personal association with God.<ref>Lee, ''Monastic and Secular Learning'', 61.</ref> \n\nAs heirs of the Dominican priory of Poissy in France, the nuns of Dartford Priory in England were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety. Strict discipline and plain living were characteristic of the monastery throughout its existence.<ref>\"[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/kent/vol2/pp181-190 Friaries: The Dominican nuns of Dartford]\".

After a (similarly unsuccessful) stint, in 1556, in [[Guangzhou#Imperial China|Guangzhou]], China, he eventually returned to Portugal and became the first European to publish a book devoted exclusively to China in 1569/1570.<ref>{{citation |title=Asia in the making of Europe |volume=Volume I, Book Two |first=Donald F. |last=Lach |year=1965 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |pages=742\u2013743}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the 16th century confronted the order with the upheavals of Revolution. The spread of Protestantism cost it six or seven provinces and several hundreds of [[convent]]s, but the discovery of the [[New World]] opened up a fresh field of activity. In the 18th century, there were numerous attempts at reform, accompanied by a reduction in the number of devotees. The French Revolution ruined the order in France, and crises that more or less rapidly followed considerably lessened or wholly destroyed numerous provinces.<ref name=Mandonnet/>\n\n===19th century to present===\nDuring the early 19th century, the number of Preachers seems never to have sunk below 3,500. Statistics for 1876 show 3,748, but 500 of these had been expelled from their convents and were engaged in [[Wikt:parochial|parochial]] work. Statistics for 1910 show a total of 4,472 nominally or actually engaged in proper activities of the order. By the year 2013 there were 6058 Dominican friars, including 4,470 priests.<ref name='ch' />\n[[File:Portrait of Dominique Lacordaire.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Lacordaire]]\n\nIn the revival movement France held a foremost place, owing to the reputation and convincing power of the orator, [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]] (1802\u20131861). He took the habit of a Friar Preacher at Rome (1839), and the province of France was canonically erected in 1850.<ref name=Scannell>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08733a.htm Scannell, Thomas. \"Jean-Baptiste-Henri Dominique Lacordaire.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 November 2015</ref> From this province were detached the province of [[Lyon]], called Occitania (1862), that of [[Toulouse]] (1869), and that of Canada (1909). The French restoration likewise furnished many laborers to other provinces, to assist in their organization and progress. From it came the [[master general]] who remained longest at the head of the administration during the 19th century, P\u00e8re [[Vincent Jandel]] (1850\u20131872). Here should be mentioned the [[The Dominican Province of Saint Joseph|province of Saint Joseph in the United States]]. Founded in 1805 by [[Edward Fenwick]], afterwards first Bishop of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (1821\u20131832). In 1905, it established a large house of studies at [[Washington, D.C.]], called the [[Dominican House of Studies]].\n\nThe province of France has produced a large number of preachers. The conferences of Notre-Dame-de-Paris were inaugurated by P\u00e8re Lacordaire. The Dominicans of the province of France furnished Lacordaire (1835\u20131836, 1843\u20131851), [[Jacques Monsabr\u00e9]],<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10508c.htm Schroeder, Henry Joseph. \"Jacques-Marie-Louis Monsabr\u00e9.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 23 December 2017</ref> and Joseph Ollivier. The pulpit of Notre Dame has been occupied by a succession of Dominicans. P\u00e8re [[Henri Didon]] (d. 1900) was a Dominican. The house of studies of the province of France publishes ''L'Ann\u00e9e Dominicaine'' (founded 1859), ''La Revue des Sciences Philosophiques et Theologiques'' (1907), and ''La Revue de la Jeunesse'' (1909). French Dominicans founded and administer the [[\u00c9cole Biblique]] et Arch\u00e9ologique fran\u00e7aise de J\u00e9rusalem founded in 1890 by [[Marie-Joseph Lagrange]] (1855\u20131938), one of the leading international centres for biblical research. It is at the ''\u00c9cole Biblique'' that the famed [[Jerusalem Bible]] (both editions) was prepared. Likewise Cardinal [[Yves Congar]] was a product of the French province of the Order of Preachers.\n\nDoctrinal development has had an important place in the restoration of the Preachers. Several institutions, besides those already mentioned, played important parts. Such is the Biblical school at [[Jerusalem]], open to the religious of the order and to secular clerics, which publishes the ''Revue Biblique.'' The ''Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum'', the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] established at Rome in 1908 by Master [[Hyacinth Cormier]], opened its doors to regulars and seculars for the study of the sacred sciences. In addition to the reviews above are the ''Revue Thomiste,'' founded by P\u00e8re Thomas Coconnier (d. 1908), and the ''Analecta Ordinis Pr\u00e6dicatorum'' (1893). Among numerous writers of the order in this period are: Cardinals [[Thomas Zigliara]] (d. 1893) and [[Zephirin Gonz\u00e1lez]] (d. 1894), two esteemed philosophers; [[Alberto Guillelmotti]] (d. 1893), historian of the Pontifical Navy, and historian [[Heinrich Denifle]] (d. 1905).<ref name=Mandonnet/>\n\nDuring the Reformation, many of the monasteries of Dominican nuns were forced to close. One which managed to survive, and afterwards founded many new houses, was St Ursula's in Augsburg. In the seventeenth century, monasteries of Dominican women were often asked by their bishops to undertake apostolic work, particularly educating girls and visiting the sick. St Ursula's returned to an enclosed life in the eighteenth century, but in the nineteenth century, after Napoleon had closed many European women's monasteries, King Louis I of Bavaria in 1828 restored the Religious Orders of women in his realm, provided that the nuns undertook some active work useful to the State (usually teaching or nursing).<ref>http://kwtdominicans.co.za/history/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1877, Bishop Ricards in South Africa requested that Augsburg send a group of nuns to start a teaching mission in King Williamstown.<ref name=\"dominicanmissionarysisters.org\">http://www.dominicanmissionarysisters.org/index.php?page=our-story</ref> From this mission were founded many Third Order Regular congregations of Dominican sisters, with their own constitutions, though still following the Rule of Saint Augustine and affiliated to the Dominican Order.

''Available Means''. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001.

Any daughter houses they founded, however, became independent.<ref>Mariette Gouws, ''All for God's People'', chapter 1</ref> But in the nineteenth century, in response to increasing missionary fervor, monasteries were asked to send groups of women to found schools and medical clinics around the world. Large numbers of Catholic women traveled to Africa, the Americas, and the East to teach and support new communities of Catholics there, both settlers and converts. Owing to the large distances involved, these groups needed to be self-governing, and they frequently planted new self-governing congregations in neighboring mission areas in order to respond more effectively to the perceived pastoral needs.<ref>Columba Cleary, Eleanora Murphy, Flora McGlynn, ''Being Driven Forward: The Story of Mother Rose Niland and the Foundation of Newcastle Dominican Sisters'', Boksburg, 1997</ref> Following on from this period of growth in the nineteenth century, and another great period of growth in those joining these congregations in the 1950s, there are currently 24,600 Sisters belonging to 150 Dominican Religious Congregations present in 109 countries affiliated to Dominican Sisters International.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dsiop.org/index.php/who-are-we |title=Dominican Sisters International |access-date=2016-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823011301/http://www.dsiop.org/index.php/who-are-we |archive-date=2016-08-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs well as the friars, Dominican sisters live their lives supported by four common values, often referred to as the Four Pillars of Dominican Life, they are: community life, common prayer, study and service. Saint Dominic called this fourfold pattern of life the \"holy preaching\". Henri Matisse was so moved by the care that he received from the Dominican Sisters that he collaborated in the design and interior decoration of their [[Chapelle du Saint-Marie du Rosaire]] in [[Vence]], France.<ref>Billot, Marcel, ed.; ''Henri Matisse: The Vence Chapel, The Archive of a Creation'', (Skira:1999)</ref>\n\n===Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic===\nThe Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic are diocesan priests who are formally affiliated to the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) through a Rule of life that they profess, and so strive for evangelical perfection under the overall direction of the Dominican friars. The origins of the Dominican fraternities can be traced from the Dominican third Order secular, which then included both priests and lay persons as members.<ref>[http://www.op.org/en/content/who-we-are-0 \"Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic\", Order of St. Dominic]</ref>  Now existing as a separate association from that of the laity, and with its own distinct rule to follow, the Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic continues to be guided by the Order in embracing the gift of the spirituality of Saint Dominic in the unique context of the diocesan priests. Along with the special grace of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, which helps them to perform the acts of the sacred ministry worthily, they receive new spiritual help from the profession, which makes them members of the Dominican Family and sharers in the grace and mission of the Order. While the Order provides them with these spiritual aids and directs them to their own sanctification, it leaves them free for the complete service of the local Church, under the jurisdiction of their own Bishop.\n\n===Laity===\n[[File:Giovanni di Paolo The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena.jpg|thumb|''The [[Mystic Marriage]] of Saint [[Catherine of Siena]]'' (1347\u20131380) by [[Giovanni di Paolo]], c. 1460 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]])]]\nLay Dominicans are governed by their own rule, the Rule of the Lay Fraternities of St. Dominic, promulgated by the Master in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.op.org/sites/www.op.org/files/public/documents/fichier/RULELatinEnglish_0.pdf|title=Information from the Laity Office at Rome}}</ref> It is the fifth Rule of the Dominican Laity; the first was issued in 1285.<ref>See also the [http://laity.op.org/eng/library Lay Dominican Web Library]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819183956/http://laity.op.org/eng/library |date=August 19, 2011 }}</ref> Lay Dominicans are also governed by the Fundamental Constitution of the Dominican Laity, and their provinces provide a General Directory and Statutes. According to their Fundamental Constitution of the Dominican Laity, sec. 4, \"They have a distinctive character in both their spirituality and their service to God and neighbor.

Dominican Associates are Christian women and men; married, single, divorced, and widowed; clergy members and lay persons who were first drawn to and then called to live out the charism and continue the mission of the Dominican Order \u2013 to praise, to bless, to preach. Associates do not take vows, but rather make a commitment to be partners with vowed members, and to share the mission and charism of the Dominican Family in their own lives, families, churches, neighborhoods, workplaces, and cities.

As the order first developed on the European continent, learning continued to be emphasized by these friars and their sisters in Christ. These religious also struggled for a deeply personal, intimate relationship with God. When the order reached England, many of these attributes were kept, but the English gave the order additional, specialized characteristics.\n\n===Blessed Humbert===\n[[Humbert of Romans]], the master general of the order from 1254 to 1263, was a great administrator, as well as preacher and writer. It was under his tenure as master general that the sisters in the order were given official membership. He also wanted his friars to reach excellence in their preaching, and this was his most lasting contribution to the order. Humbert is at the center of ascetic writers in the Dominican Order. He advised his readers,\n\"[Young Dominicans] are also to be instructed not to be eager to see visions or work miracles, since these avail little to salvation, and sometimes we are fooled by them; but rather they should be eager to do good in which salvation consists. Also, they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have; but they should know the loving Father for some reason sometimes withholds these. Again, they should learn that if they lack the grace of compunction or devotion they should not think they are not in the state of grace as long as they have good will, which is all that God regards\".<ref>Woods, 37. Quoted from [[Benedict Ashley]], The Dominicans (Collegeville, MN, 1990).</ref>\n\nThe English Dominicans took this to heart, and made it the focal point of their mysticism.\n\n===Mysticism===\nBy 1300, the enthusiasm for preaching and conversion within the order lessened. Mysticism, full of the ideas Albertus Magnus expostulated, became the devotion of the greatest minds and hands within the organization.<ref>Bennett, 71. This was especially true of the Dominicans in Germany and France.</ref> It became a \"powerful instrument of personal and theological transformation both within the Order of Preachers and throughout the wider reaches of Christendom.<ref>Woods, 44. Albertus Magnus helped shape English Dominican thought through his idea that God is knowable, but obscure. Additionally, the English friars shared his belief that wisdom and understanding enhance one's faith in God. The English Dominicans also studied classical writers. This was also part of his legacy.</ref>\n\nAlthough Albertus Magnus did much to instill mysticism in the Order of Preachers, it is a concept that reaches back to the Hebrew Bible. In the tradition of Holy Writ, the impossibility of coming face to face with God is a recurring motif, thus the commandment against graven images (Exodus 20.4\u20135). As time passed, Jewish and early Christian writings presented the idea of 'unknowing,' where God's presence was enveloped in a dark cloud. All of these ideas associated with mysticism were at play in the spirituality of the Dominican community, and not only among the men. In Europe, in fact, it was often the female members of the order, such as [[Catherine of Siena]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], [[Christine of Stommeln]], [[Margaret Ebner]], and Elsbet Stagl,<ref>Woods, 110.</ref> that gained reputations for having mystical experiences. Notable male members of the order associated with mysticism include [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Henry Suso]].\n\n===Albertus Magnus===\n[[File:Albertus Magnus Painting by Joos van Gent.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of [[Albertus Magnus]] (1206\u20131280) by [[Justus van Gent]], ca. 1475]]\nAnother who contributed significantly to the spirituality of the order is [[Albertus Magnus]], influence on the brotherhood permeated nearly every aspect of Dominican life. One of Albert's greatest contributions was his study of [[Dionysus the Areopagite]], a mystical theologian whose words left an indelible imprint in the medieval period. Magnus' writings made a significant contribution to German mysticism, which became vibrant in the minds of the Beguines and women such as [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]].<ref>Woods, 39.</ref> Mysticism refers to the conviction that all believers have the capability to experience God's love. This love may manifest itself through brief ecstatic experiences, such that one may be engulfed by God and gain an immediate knowledge of Him, which is unknowable through the intellect alone.<ref name = \"vlctla\">Ross, 162</ref>\n\nAlbertus Magnus championed the idea, drawn from Dionysus, that positive knowledge of God is possible, but obscure. Thus, it is easier to state what God is not, than to state what God is:\n\"...&nbsp;we affirm things of God only relatively, that is, casually, whereas we deny things of God absolutely, that is, with reference to what He is in Himself. And there is no contradiction between a relative affirmation and an absolute negation. It is not contradictory to say that someone is white-toothed and not white\".<ref>Tugwell, 153. See also, Wood, 41.</ref>\n\nAlbert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one's faith in God. According to him, these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative. Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement. It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God, but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding. Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but she does not know what God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God's creation but it cannot see God Himself.<ref>Hinnebusch, History of the Dominican Order, 299. See also, Tugwell, 40\u201395, 134\u201398.</ref>\n\n===English Dominican mysticism===\nConcerning humanity as the image of Christ, English Dominican spirituality concentrated on the moral implications of image-bearing rather than the philosophical foundations of the [[imago Dei]]. The process of Christ's life, and the process of image-bearing, amends humanity to God's image.<ref>Clark, 90\u201398. See also, Ross, 165</ref> The idea of the \"image of God\" demonstrates both the ability of man to move toward God (as partakers in Christ's redeeming sacrifice), and that, on some level, man is always an image of God. As their love and knowledge of God grows and is sanctified by faith and experience, the image of God within man becomes ever more bright and clear.<ref>Ross, 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nEnglish Dominican mysticism in the late medieval period differed from European strands of it in that, whereas European Dominican mysticism tended to concentrate on ecstatic experiences of union with the divine, English Dominican mysticism's ultimate focus was on a crucial dynamic in one's personal relationship with God. This was an essential moral imitation of the Savior as an ideal for religious change, and as the means for reformation of humanity's nature as an image of divinity. This type of mysticism carried with it four elements. First, spiritually it emulated the moral essence of Christ's life. Second, there was a connection linking moral emulation of Christ's life and humanity's disposition as images of the divine. Third, English Dominican mysticism focused on an embodied spirituality with a structured love of fellow men at its center. Finally, the supreme aspiration of this mysticism was either an ethical or an actual union with God.<ref>Ross, 160</ref>\n\nFor English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience was not expressed just in one moment of the full knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics it was possible to pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God.<ref name = \"vlctla\"/> They experienced a mystical process that allowed them, in the end, to experience what they had already gained knowledge of through their faith only.<ref>Ross, 163</ref>\n\nThe center of all mystical experience is, of course, Christ. English Dominicans sought to gain a full knowledge of Christ through an imitation of His life. English mystics of all types tended to focus on the moral values that the events in Christ's life exemplified. This led to a \"progressive understanding of the meanings of Scripture\u2014literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical\"<ref name = \"jqmjge\">Ross, 164</ref>\u2014that was contained within the mystical journey itself. From these considerations of Scripture comes the simplest way to imitate Christ: an emulation of the moral actions and attitudes that Jesus demonstrated in His earthly ministry becomes the most significant way to feel and have knowledge of God.<ref name = \"jqmjge\"/>\n\nThe English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ's life, not the literality of events. They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata<ref>The appearance of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]'s and [[Catherine of Siena]]'s [[stigmata]] is well known.</ref> or any other physical manifestation. They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission, insofar as they were able. At the center of this environment was love: the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation. English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity. This increase in universal love allowed men's wills to conform to God's will, just as Christ's will submitted to the Father's will.<ref>Clark, 83</ref>\n\n===Charity and meekness===\nAs the image of God grows within man, he learns to rely less on an intellectual pursuit of virtue and more on an affective pursuit of charity and meekness. Thus, man then directs his path to that One, and the love for, and of, Christ guides man's very nature to become centered on the One, and on his neighbor as well.<ref>Ross, 169.</ref> Charity is the manifestation of the pure love of Christ, both for and by His follower.\n\nAlthough the ultimate attainment for this type of mysticism is union with God, it is not necessarily visionary, nor does it hope only for ecstatic experiences; instead, mystical life is successful if it is imbued with charity. The goal is just as much to become like Christ as it is to become one with Him.<ref name= \"vlctla\"/> Those who believe in Christ should first have faith in Him without becoming engaged in such overwhelming phenomena.\n\nThe Dominican Order was affected by a number of elemental influences. Its early members imbued the order with a mysticism and learning. The Europeans of the order embraced ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and looked to a union with the Creator. The English Dominicans looked for this complete unity as well, but were not so focused on ecstatic experiences. Instead, their goal was to emulate the moral life of Christ more completely. The Dartford nuns were surrounded by all of these legacies, and used them to create something unique. Though they are not called mystics, they are known for their piety toward God and their determination to live lives devoted to, and in emulation of, Him.\n\n===Rosary===\nDevotion to the Virgin Mary was another very important aspect of Dominican spirituality. As an order, the Dominicans believed that they were established through the good graces of Christ's mother, and through prayers she sent missionaries to save the souls of nonbelievers.<ref name = \"pxxovl\">Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality, 152.</ref> Dominican brothers and sisters who were unable to participate in the Divine Office sang the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin each day and saluted her as their advocate.<ref name = \"pxxovl\"/>\n\nThroughout the centuries, the Holy [[Rosary]] has been an important element among the Dominicans.<ref>See Guy Bedouelle, ''Saint Dominic. The Grace of the Word'' (Ignatius 1987).</ref> [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that: \"The Rosary of Mary is the principle and foundation on which the very Order of Saint Dominic rests for making perfect the life of its members and obtaining the salvation of others.\"<ref>Robert Feeney, ''The Rosary: \"The Little Summa\"'' {{ISBN|0-9622347-1-0}}</ref>\n\nHistories of the Holy [[Rosary]] often attribute its origin to [[Saint Dominic]] himself through the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref>Catherine Beebe, ''St. Dominic and the Rosary'' {{ISBN|0-89870-518-5}}</ref> [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] is the title related to the [[Marian apparitions|Marian apparition]] to [[Saint Dominic]] in 1208 in the church of [[Prouille]] in which the Virgin Mary gave the Rosary to him. For centuries, Dominicans have been instrumental in spreading the rosary and emphasizing the Catholic belief in the [[power of the rosary]].<ref>History of the Dominicans {{cite web
