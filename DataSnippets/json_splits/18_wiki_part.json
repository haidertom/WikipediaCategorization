It entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] in August 1972. Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft.<ref name=\"Ray_PDF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_055755.pdf|title=AGM-65 Maverick|publisher=Raytheon|format=PDF|year=2007|accessdate=22 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728105311/http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_055755.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref> The Maverick served during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur]], [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|Iran\u2013Iraq]], and [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]s, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.\n\nSince its introduction into service, numerous Maverick versions had been designed and produced, using electro-optical, [[Laser guidance|laser]], [[charge-coupled device]] and [[Infrared homing|infra-red]] [[guidance system]]s. The AGM-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. The missile is currently produced by [[Raytheon Missile Systems]].\n\nThe Maverick shares the same configuration as Hughes's [[AIM-4 Falcon]] and [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], and measures more than {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} in length and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter.\n\n==Development==\nThe Maverick's development history began in 1965, when the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) began a program to develop a replacement to the [[AGM-12 Bullpup]].<ref name=\"Clancy_p163\">{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=163}}</ref> With a range of {{convert|8.8|nmi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}, the radio-guided Bullpup was introduced in 1959 and was considered a \"silver bullet\" by operators. However, the launch aircraft was required to fly straight towards the target during the missile's flight instead of performing evasive maneuvers, thus risking the crew.<ref name=Clancy_p163/> Even when it hit, the small {{convert|250|lbs}} warhead was only useful against small targets like bunkers, when used against larger targets like the [[Thanh H\u00f3a Bridge]] it did little other than char the structure.<ref>{{cite book |first= Benjamin |last=Lambeth |title= The Transformation of American Air Power |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g28yvaf3988C&pg=PA39 |date=2000 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=39|isbn=0801438160 }}</ref> The USAF began a series of projects to replace Bullpup, both larger versions of Bullpup, models C and D, as well as a series of Bullpup adaptations offering fire-and-forget guidance. Among the later were the [[AGM-83 Bulldog]], [[AGM-79 Blue Eye]] and [[AGM-80 Viper]].\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Missile Systems Division]] and [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] competed for the contract to build an entirely new fire-and-forget missile with far greater range performance than any of the Bullpup versions. Each were allocated $3&nbsp;million for preliminary design and engineering work of the Maverick in 1966.<ref name=FI_AGM/> In 1968, Hughes emerged with the $95&nbsp;million contract for further development and testing of the missile; at the same time, contract options called for 17,000 missiles to be procured.<ref name=FI_AGM/> Hughes conducted a smooth development of the AGM-65 Maverick, with the first unguided test launch from a F-4 on 18 September 1969,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Maverick Under Control |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%202966.html |journal=Flight International |date=9 October 1969 |page=582}}</ref> with the first guided test on 18 December successfully performing a direct hit on a [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M41 tank]] target at the Air Force Missile Development Center at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name=FI_AGM/>\n\nIn July&nbsp;1971, the USAF and Hughes signed a $69.9&nbsp;million contract for 2,000 missiles,<ref name=FI_AGM/> the first of which was delivered in 1972.<ref name=Clancy_p163/> Although early operational results were favorable, military planners predicted that the Maverick would fare less successfully in the hazy conditions of [[Central Europe]], where it would have been used against [[Warsaw Pact]] forces.<ref name=\"Clancy_p164\">{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=164}}</ref> As such, development of the AGM-65B began in 1975 before it was delivered during the late 1970s. When production of the AGM-65A/B was ended in 1978, more than 35,000 missiles had been built.<ref name=ds/>\n\nMore versions of the Maverick appeared, among which was the [[Laser guidance|laser-guided]] AGM-65C/E. Development of the AGM-65C started in 1978 by [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]], who built a number of development missiles for the USAF.<ref name=ds/><ref name=Clancy_p164/> Due to high cost, the version was not procured by the USAF, and instead entered service with the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) as the AGM-65E.<ref name=ds/><ref name=Clancy_p164/>\n\nAnother major development was the AGM-65D, which employed an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker.  By imaging on radiated heat, the IIR is all-weather operable as well as showing improved performance in acquiring and tracking the hot engines, such as in tanks and trucks, that were to be one of its major missions.<ref name=ds/> The seekerhead mechanically scanned the scene over a nitrogen-cooled 4-by-4 pixel array using a series of mirrored facets machined into the inner surface of the ring-shaped main gyroscope.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The five-year development period of the AGM-65D started in 1977 and ended with the first delivery to the USAF in October 1983.<ref name=ds/> The version received [[initial operating capability]] in February 1986.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\nThe AGM-65F is a hybrid Maverick combining the AGM-65D's IIR seeker and warhead and propulsion components of the AGM-65E.<ref name=ds/> Deployed by the [[United States Navy]] (USN), the AGM-65F is optimized for maritime strike roles.<ref name=ds/> The first AGM-65F launch from the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C]] took place in 1989, and in 1994, the USN awarded [[Unisys]] a contract to integrate the version with the P-3C.<ref name=PDF_2001/><ref name=Friedman_p562/> Meanwhile, Hughes produced the AGM-65G, which essentially has the same guidance system as the D, with some software modifications that track larger targets, coupled with a [[Shaped charge|shaped-charge]] warhead.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s to early 2000s, there were several ideas of enhancing the Maverick's potential. Among them was the stillborn plan to incorporate the Maverick [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wave]] [[active radar homing]], which can determine the exact shape of a target.<ref name=\"Clancy_p166\">{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=166.}}</ref> Another study called \"Longhorn Project\"<ref name=Clancy_p166/> was conducted by Hughes, and later Raytheon following the absorption of Hughes into Raytheon, looked a Maverick version equipped with [[turbojet]] engines instead of rocket motors.

The AGM-65 has two types of [[warhead]]s: one has a [[contact fuze]] in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its [[kinetic energy]] before detonating. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a [[solid-fuel rocket]] motor behind the warhead.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\nThe Maverick missile is unable to lock onto targets on its own; it has to be given input by the pilot or [[weapon systems officer]] (WSO) after which it follows the path to the target autonomously, allowing the WSO to [[Fire-and-forget|fire and forget]]. In an [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt IIs]], for example, the video fed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. A crosshair on the [[head-up display]] is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target while the missile will then automatically recognize and lock on to the target. Once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. This fire-and-forget property is not shared by the E version that uses [[Laser guidance|semi-active laser homing]].<ref name=ds/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Differences between different Maverick versions<ref name=Factsheet/><ref name=ds/><ref name=B&M_230/><ref name=Ray_PDF/>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| ||'''AGM-65A/B''' ||'''AGM-65D'''  ||'''AGM-65E'''  ||'''AGM-65F/G''' ||'''AGM-65H''' || '''AGM-65J''' ||'''AGM-65K'''\n|-\n|'''Length''' || colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|8|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Wingspan''' || colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|28.3|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Diameter''' || colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Weight''' || {{convert|462|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}|| {{convert|485|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} || {{convert|645|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} || {{convert|675|lb|abbr=on|kg|order=flip}} || {{convert|462|or|465|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} || {{convert|654|lb|abbr=on|kg|order=flip}} || {{convert|675|lb|abbr=on|kg|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Speed''' || colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|620|kn|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Range''' || colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\" | Greater than {{convert|12|nmi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|'''Guidance''' || [[Electro-optics|Electro-optical]] TV || [[Thermographic camera|Imaging infrared]] || [[Laser guidance|Laser]] || Imaging infrared || colspan=\"3\" class=\"unsortable\" | [[Charge-coupled device]]\n|-\n|'''Propulsion''' || [[Thiokol]] SR109-TC-1 solid-fuel rocket || colspan=\"6\" class=\"unsortable\" | Thiokol SR114-TC-1 (or Aerojet SR115-AJ-1) solid-fuel rocket\n|-\n|'''Warhead''' || colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|57|kg|lb|abbr=on}} WDU-20/B shaped-charge|| colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|136|kg|lb|abbr=on}} WDU-24/B penetrating [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|blast-fragmentation]] || {{convert|57|kg|lb|abbr=on}} WDU-20/B shaped-charge || colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{convert|136|kg|lb|abbr=on}} WDU-24/B penetrating [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|blast-fragmentation]]\n|}\n\n[[File:US Navy 041128-N-5345W-016 Aviation Ordnanceman 3rd Class William Miller arms a AGM-65 Maverick laser-guided missile.jpg|thumb|right|Laser AGM-65 Maverick on a USN F/A-18C, 2004]]\n* '''Maverick A''' is the basic model and uses an electro-optical television guidance system.

A reduced smoke rocket engine was also introduced in this model. It achieved its initial operation capability in 1983.\n* '''Maverick E''' uses a laser designator guidance system optimized for fortified installations and heavier penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead ({{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} vs. {{convert|125|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} in older models).

Tomcat]], its only operational launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The combination of Phoenix missile and the [[AN/AWG-9]] guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets. Due to its active radar tracking, the [[Multiservice tactical brevity code#F|brevity code]] \"Fox Three\" was used when firing the AIM-54.\n\nBoth  the missile and the aircraft were used by Iran and the [[United States Navy]]. In US service both are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by the shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], employed on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] - in [[AIM-120 AMRAAM#Air-to-air missile versions|its AIM-120D version]], the latest version of the AMRAAM just matches the Phoenix's maximum range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-long-range-missile-project-emerges-in-us-budget-442816/|title=New long-range missile project emerges in US budget|date=November 2, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nThe AIM-54 is credited with 62 air-to-air kills, all scored by Iran during the long [[Iran-Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csbaonline.org/uploads/documents/Air-to-Air-Report-.pdf|title=Trends in Air-to-Air Combat: Implications for Future Air Superiority|page=22|author=John Stillion|publisher=Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA)}}</ref> Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S. Navy, the weapon's only current operator is the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]. \n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nSince 1951, the Navy faced the initial threat from the [[Tupolev Tu-4|Tupolev Tu-4K 'Bull']] carrying<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=V-1 Flying Bomb, 1942\u201352: Hitler's Infamous \"Doodlebug\"|author1=Zaloga, S.J.|author2=Laurier, J.|date=2005|publisher=Osprey Publishing, Limited |isbn=9781841767918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGyc0NZEe_QC|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> [[anti-ship missile]]s or nuclear bombs.\n\nEventually, during the height of the Cold War, the threat would have expanded into regimental-size raids of [[Tu-16 Badger]] and [[Tu-22M Backfire]] bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) of various types. This combination was considered capable of saturating fleet defenses and threatening carrier groups. \n\nThe Navy would require a long-range, long-endurance [[interceptor aircraft]] to defend [[carrier battle group]]s against this threat. The proposed [[F6D Missileer]] was intended to fulfill this mission and oppose the attack as far as possible from the fleet it was defending. The weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the Bendix [[AAM-N-10 Eagle]], was to be an air-to-air missile of unprecedented range when compared to contemporary [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missiles. It would work together with [[Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems|Westinghouse]] [[AN/APQ-81]] radar. The Missileer project was cancelled in December 1960.\n\n===AIM-54===\n[[File:AIM-54A first test A-3A NAN11-66.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54A launched from the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|NA-3A]]-testbed in 1966]]\n\nIn the early 1960s, the U.S. Navy made the next interceptor attempt with the [[General Dynamics\u2013Grumman F-111B|F-111B]], and they needed a new missile design. At the same time, the [[USAF]] canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, the [[North American XF-108 Rapier]] and the [[Lockheed YF-12]], and left the capable [[AIM-47 Falcon]] missile at a quite advanced stage of development, but with no effective launch platform.\n\nThe AIM-54 Phoenix, developed for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with four cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47. One characteristic of the Missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it [[mid-course correction]]s, which allowed the fire control system to \"loft\" the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.\n\nThe F-111B was canceled in 1968. Its weapons system, the AIM-54 working with the [[AWG-9 radar]], migrated to the new U.S. Navy fighter project, the VFX, which would later become the [[F-14|F-14 Tomcat]].\n\nIn 1977, development of a significantly improved Phoenix version, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ECM.<ref name=\"designation-systems\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html|title=Raytheon AIM-54 Phoenix|publisher=designation-systems.net|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Usage in comparison to other weapon systems==\nThe AIM-54/AWG-9 combination had multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to six Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} missile is equipped with a conventional warhead.\n\nOn the F-14, four missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus two under glove stations. A full load of six Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weighs in at over {{convert|8000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of four Phoenix, two [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sparrow]], and two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] missiles.\n\nMost other US aircraft relied on the smaller, [[Semi-active radar homing|semi-active]] medium-range [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]. Semi-active guidance meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, reducing [[situational awareness]].\n\nThe Tomcat's radar could track up to 24 targets in [[track-while-scan]] mode, with the AWG-9 selecting up to six potential targets for the missiles. The pilot or [[radar intercept officer]] (RIO) could then launch the Phoenix missiles once parameters were met. The large tactical information display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and the radar could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining situational awareness of the battlespace.\n\nThe [[Link 4]] datalink allowed US Navy Tomcats to share information with the [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] [[airborne early warning|AEW]] aircraft. During [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] in 1990, the Link 4A was introduced; this allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better [[Link 16]] datalink \"picture\" to the cockpit.\n\n===Active guidance===\n[[File:F-14A VF-1 launching AIM-54 Phoenix.JPEG|thumb|AIM-54 Phoenix seconds after launch (1991)]]\n\nThe Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between {{convert|80000|ft|m|-3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100000|ft|m|-4|abbr=on}} at close to Mach 5. The Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance.<ref name=\"Directory\">[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html \"AIM-54\"] (2004).

F-14 Tomcats were retired on September 22, 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]].\n\nDespite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in US Navy service, though a large number of [[Iranian aerial victories during the Iran-Iraq war|kills]] were claimed by Iranian F-14s during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The USAF [[F-15 Eagle]] had responsibility for overland [[combat air patrol]] duties in Operation [[Desert Storm]] in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 [[identification friend or foe|IFF]] capabilities. The Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the [[JFACC]] to satisfy the rules of engagement to utilize the Phoenix capability at [[beyond visual range]]. The AIM-54 was not adopted by any foreign nation besides [[Iran]], or any other US armed service, and was not used on any aircraft other than the F-14.\n\n===Iranian combat experience===\n[[File:Irani F-14 Tomcats carrying AIM-54 Phoenixs.jpg|thumb|Iranian F-14 Tomcats armed with multiple missiles, including AIM-54 Phoenix, 1986.]]\n\nThere is very little information available regarding Iran's use of its 79 F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most [[Western world|western]] outlets. The exception is a book released by [[Osprey Publishing]] titled ''Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat'' by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop.<ref name=\"Bishop\">{{cite web| url= http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml | title =Book: Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat| publisher = Acig |accessdate= 3 February 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100130102218/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml| archivedate = 30 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews.

According to Cooper, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force kept its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the entire Iran\u2013Iraq War, though periodic lack of spares grounded large parts of the fleet at times. During late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with fewer than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh [[thermal batteries]] that could only be purchased from the US. Iran found a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries, which cost up to US$10,000 each. Iran received spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.<ref>{{cite web | last = Theimer| first = Sharon | title = Iran Gets Army Gear in Pentagon Sale | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = 17 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070119084031/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | archivedate = 19 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nBoth the F-14 Tomcat and AIM-54 Phoenix missile continue in the service of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]].

It did not require coolant conditioning during flights on board F-14s and not fired (the usual situation). Deployed beginning in 1988. Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed received no coolant, F-14s carrying this version of the missile could not exceed a specified airspeed.\n\nThere were also test, evaluation, ground training, and captive air training versions of the missile; designated ATM-54, AEM-54, DATM-54A, and CATM-54. The flight versions had A and C versions. The DATM-54 was not made in a C version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.\n\n;{{vanchor |Sea Phoenix}}: A 1970s proposal for a ship launched version of the Phoenix as an alternative/replacement for the [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] point defense system. It would also have provided a medium-range SAM capability for smaller and/or non-Aegis equipped vessels (such as the [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV]]). The Sea Phoenix system would have included a modified shipborne version of the [[AN/AWG-9]] radar. Hughes Aircraft touted the fact that 27 out of 29 major elements of the standard (airborne) AN/AWG-9 could be used in the shipborne version with little modification. Each system would have consisted of one AWG-9 radar, with associated controls and displays, and a fixed 12-cell launcher for the Phoenix missiles. In the case of an aircraft carrier, for example, at least three systems would have been fitted in order to give overlapping coverage throughout the full 360\u00b0.<ref name=JanesWS76>{{Citation | publisher = Jane's | title = Weapon Systems | year = 1977}}.</ref>{{Page needed | date = January 2014}} Both land and ship based tests of modified Phoenix (AIM-54A) missiles and a containerised AWG-9 (originally the 14th example off the AN/AWG-9 production line) were successfully carried out from 1974 onwards.<ref name =Tarpgaard>{{Citation | first = PT | last = Tarpgaard | title = The Sea Phoenix\u2014A Warship Design Study | journal = ASNE | volume = 88 | number = 2 | pages = 31\u201344 | year = 1976}}.</ref> \n;AIM-54B: A land based version for the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] was also proposed.

It is capable of delivering precision firepower or area-saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time, at night or in adverse weather. The sensor suite consists of a television sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.\n\nThe AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include [[inertial navigation system]]s and a [[Global Positioning System]].

The Black Crow system was [[Master-slave (technology)|slaved]] into the targeting computers of the AC-130A/E/H, enabling the detection of the unshielded [[ignition coil]]s of North Vietnamese trucks hidden under dense jungle foliage along the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. It could also detect hand-held transmitter signals of air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets.\n\nThe PGM-38/U enhanced 25&nbsp;mm [[high explosive incendiary]] round was created to expand the AC-130U gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25&nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12/U]] gun. This round is a combination of the existing PGU-25 HEI and a M758 fuze designated as FMU-151/B to meet the MIL-STD-1316.

In June 1968, AC-130s were deployed to [[Tan Son Nhut]] AB near Saigon for support against the [[Tet Offensive]]. By 30 October 1968, enough AC-130 Gunship IIs arrived to form a squadron, the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS) of the [[8th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (TFW), at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. It was at this time that the C-130A gunship was designated the AC-130A.\n\nOn 18 August 1968, an AC-130 gunship flying an armed reconnaissance mission in Vietnam's III Corps was diverted to support the [[Katum Camp|Katum Special Forces Camp]]. The ground commander quickly assessed the accurate fire and capabilities of this weapon system and called for fire on his own perimeter when the Viet Cong attempted to bridge the wire on the west side of his position.\n\nBy December 1968, most AC-130s flew under [[F-4 Phantom II]] escort (to protect the gunship against heavy and concentrated AAA fire) from the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, normally three Phantoms per Gunship.  On 24 May 1969, the first Spectre gunship was lost to enemy fire.<ref name=Hobson_Losses>{{Citation |page= 268 |last= Hobson |first= Chris |title= Vietnam Air Losses: United States Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps Fixed-Wing Aircraft Losses in Southeast Asia, 1961\u20131973 |place= Hinckley, England, United Kingdom |publisher= Midland |year= 2001 |ISBN= 1-85780-115-6}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1969, under code name \"Surprise Package\", 56-0490 arrived with solid-state laser-illuminated low-light-level-TV with a companion YAG [[laser designator]], an improved [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) sensor, video recording for TV and FLIR, an [[inertial navigation system]], and a prototype [[Digital data|digital]] [[fire control computer]]. The remaining AC-130s were refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to Ubon RTAFB. On 25 October 1971, the first \"Cadillac\" gunship, the AC-130E arrived in Vietnam. On 17 February 1972, the first 105&nbsp;mm cannon arrived for service with Spectre and was installed on Gunship 570. It was used from mid-February until the aircraft received battle damage to its right flap. The cannon was switched to Gunship 571 and was used until 30 March when the aircraft was shot down.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of AC-130 Spectre gunships lost in the Vietnam War 1969\u20131972\n!Date!!Gunship model!!Unit!!Cause of loss / remarks\n|-\n|24/05/69\n|AC-130A\n|16th [[Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS)\n|Downed by 37&nbsp;mm [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AA) at 6,500 feet while on [[reconnaissance]] for enemy trucks.<ref>Hobson p. 182.</ref>\n|-\n|22/04/70\n|AC-130A\n|16th SOS\n|Downed while [[truck]] hunting by 37&nbsp;mm AA<ref>Hobson p. 202.</ref>\n|-\n|28/03/72\n|AC-130A\n|16th SOS\n|Downed while truck hunting along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] by a [[SA-2]] [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM).

Spectre was still needed and active in the region, supporting operations in Laos and Cambodia. On 22 February 1973, American offensive operations in Laos ended and the gunships became totally committed to operations in the Cambodian conflict.\n\nOn 12 April 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] were threatening the capital of [[Phnom Penh]] and AC-130s were called on to help in [[Operation Eagle Pull]], the final evacuation of American and allied officials from Phnom Penh before it was conquered by the communists. The AC-130 was also over Saigon on 30 April 1975 to protect the final evacuation in [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. Spectres were also called in when the [[Mayaguez incident|SS Mayaguez]] was seized, on the open sea, by Khmer Rouge soldiers and sailors on 15 May 1975.\n\nSix AC-130s and 52 air crew members were lost during the war.<ref name=Hobson_Losses/>  AC-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close air support missions in Vietnam.\n\n===Cold War and later action===\n[[File:AC-130A pylon turn.jpg|thumb|AC-130A performs a left-hand [[pylon turn]]]]\n\nWith the conclusion of hostilities in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the AC-130H became the sole gunship in the regular Air Force, home based at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida, while the AC-130A fleet was transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s 919th Tactical Airlift Group (919 TAG) at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field #3/[[Duke Field]], Florida. With the transition to the AC-130A, the 919 TAG was then redesignated as the [[919th Special Operations Wing|919th Special Operations Group]] (919 SOG).\n\nIn the late 1970s, when the AC-130H fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from Hurlburt Field, Florida, non-stop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over Empire Firing Range in the Republic of Panama, then return home. This 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the [[contiguous United States]] to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.\n\nAC-130s from both the [[4th Special Operations Squadron|4th]] and [[16th Special Operations Squadron|16th]] Special Operations Squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in, officially and unofficially, since the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nIn July 1979, AC-130H crews deployed to [[Howard Air Force Base]], Panama, as a precaution against possible hostile actions against American personnel during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. New time aloft and non-stop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th SOS 2-ship AC-130H formation flight that departed Hurlburt Field on 13 November 1979 and landed on 15 November at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], a distance of {{convert |7200|nmi|km}} and 29 hours 43 minutes non-stop, refueling four times in-flight.<ref>Lockheed records.</ref><ref>{{Citation |type= article |format= magazine |first= Pilot Lt Col Jim |last= Lawrence |date=June 1995 |title= ?? |publisher= AFSOC |newspaper= Night Flyer}}</ref> Refueling support for the Guam deployment was provided by KC-135 crews from the 305th Air Refueling Wing from [[Grissom AFB]], Indiana.\n\nIn November 1979, four AC-130H gunships flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field to Anderson AFB, Guam, because of the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage situation at the Embassy in Iran]]. At Guam, AC-130H crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. This deployment with the 1 SOW/CC as Task Force commander was directed from the office of the CJCS for fear that Iranian militants could begin executing American Embassy personnel who had been [[Iran hostage crisis|taken hostage on 4 November]]. One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight. Upon return in March 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in Egypt to support the [[Operation Eagle Claw|ill-fated hostage rescue attempt]].\n\n[[File:AC-130 gunship firing broadside at dusk.jpg|thumb|left|Smoke visible from [[Gatling gun]] during twilight operations in 1988]]\nDuring [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in Grenada in 1983, AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the [[Point Salines International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]] via [[airdrop]] and air-land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[William H. Tunner|Lieutenant General William H. Tunner]] Award for the mission.\n\nThe AC-130Hs of the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] unit maintained an ongoing rotation to Howard AB, Panama, monitoring activities in El Salvador and other Central American points of interest, with rules of engagement eventually permitting attacks on [[FMLN]] targets.

Aircrews earned the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year, and the Tunner Award.\n\n===Gulf War and the 1990s===\n[[File:USAF_AC130_Operation.ogv|thumb|right|USAF AC-130 in combat operation]]\n\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] of 1990\u201391 (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces, and battlefield interdiction. The primary interdiction targets were early warning/[[Ground-controlled interception|ground control intercept]] (EW/GCI) sites along the southern border of [[Iraq]]. At its standard altitude of 12,000 feet, the aircraft had a proven ability to engage moving ground targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles2005/200563005819.asp|title=Why the AC-130 Fears Daylight|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> The first gunship to enter the [[Battle of Khafji]] helped stop a southbound Iraqi armored column on 29 January 1991.

AC-130s took part in [[Timeline of United States military operations#1991\u20131999|Operation Assured Response]] in Liberia in 1996 and in [[Operation Silver Wake]] in 1997, the evacuation of American [[non-combatants]] from [[Albania]].\n\nAC-130s took part in the [[NATO]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the 1990s.\n\nThe AC-130U gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 on 22 and 23 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida to [[Taegu Air Base]] (Daegu), South Korea, being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. The two gunships took on 410,000&nbsp;lb (186,000&nbsp;kg) of fuel. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in 1998 to compel [[Iraq]] to allow [[UNSCOM]] weapons inspections.\n\n===War on Terror===\n[[File:AC-130 Training.jpg|thumb|An AC-130U releasing [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]]]]\n\nThe U.S. has used gunships with deployments to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] (Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan) (2001\u20132014), and [[Iraq War]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom) (2003\u201311). AC-130 strikes were directed by special forces on known Taliban locations during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Special Operations Forces are using the AC-130 to support its operations. The day after arriving in Afghanistan, the AC-130s attacked Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces near the city of Konduz and were directly responsible for the city's surrender the next day. On 26 November 2001, Spectres were called in to put down [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi|a rebellion]] at the prison fort of [[Qala-I-Janghi]]. The 16 SOS flew missions over Mazar-i-Sharif, [[History of Kunduz|Kunduz]], Kandahar, Shkin, Asadabad, Bagram, Baghran, Tora Bora, and virtually every other part of Afghanistan. The Spectre participated in countless operations within Afghanistan, performing on-call close air support and armed reconnaissance. In March 2002, three AC-130 Spectres provided 39 crucial combat missions in support of [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan. During the intense fighting, the planes fired more than 1,300 40&nbsp;mm and 1,200 105&nbsp;mm rounds.\n\nClose air support was the main mission of the AC-130 in Iraq. Night after night, at least one AC-130 was in the air to fulfill one or more air support requests (ASRs). A typical mission had the AC\u2013130 supporting a single brigade's ASRs followed by aerial refueling and another two hours with another brigade or SOF team. The use of AC-130s in places like Fallujah, urban settings where insurgents were among crowded populations of non-combatants, was criticized by human rights groups. AC-130s were also used for intelligence gathering with their sophisticated long-range video, infrared and radar sensors. In 2007, US Special Operations forces also used the AC-130 in attacks on suspected [[Al-Qaeda]] militants in Somalia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/08/somalia.strike/ |title=Pentagon official: US attacks al Qaeda suspects in Somalia |publisher=CNN |date=8 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6296971.stm |title=US plane 'bombed Somalia targets' |publisher=BBC |work=Africa News}}</ref>\n\nThere were eight AC-130H and seventeen AC-130U aircraft in active-duty service as of July 2010.<ref name=\"AF_factsht\" /> In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force deployed two AC-130U gunships to take part in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]], the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|U.S. military intervention in Libya]],<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-28/coalition-isn-t-coordinating-strikes-with-rebels-u-s-says-1-.html |title=Coalition Isn't Coordinating Strikes With Rebels, US Says |first=Brendan |last=McGarry |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=28 March 2011}}</ref> which eventually came under [[NATO]] as [[Operation Unified Protector]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29military.html |title=US Gives Its Air Power Expansive Role in Libya |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |date=29 March 2011 |work=The New York Times |page=A13 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{external media\n|align=right\n| video1 ={{youtube|6FvmWBx6BLw|AC-130 Whiskey}} from [[Discovery Science (Asia)#Programming|Deadliest Tech]]\n}}<!--American Heroes Channel is part of Military Channel, part of Discovery-->\nBy September 2013, 14 MC-130W Dragon Spear aircraft have been converted to AC-130W Stinger II gunships.

In 1980, the aircraft was upgraded from the original three-bladed propellers to the quieter four-bladed propellers and was eventually retired in late 1995. The retirement also marked an end to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] flying the AC-130A. The aircraft now sits on display in the final Air Force Reserve Command configuration with grey paint, black markings, and the four-bladed Hamilton Sunstrand 54H60-91 props at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida, USA.<ref>[http://www.gunships.org/birds.html \"List of AC-130 Gunships.\"] ''Gunships.''

The aircraft participated in the Vietnam War and the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue]] of the [[SS Mayaguez]]. ''Ultimate End'' demonstrated the durability of the C-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 December 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 April 1971 and a 57&nbsp;mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 March 1972. \"Ultimate End\" was reassigned to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field No.3 / [[Duke Field]] on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to [[Air Force Special Operations Command]]'s ''Heritage Air Park'' at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida. While assigned to the [[711th Special Operations Squadron]], ''Ultimate End'' served in Operations JUST CAUSE in Panama, [[DESERT STORM]] in Kuwait and Iraq, and UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti. After 36 years and seven months of service, 24 years as a gunship, ''Ultimate End'' retired from active service on 1 October 1994. It made its last flight from [[Duke Field]] to [[Hurlburt Field]] on 20 October 1994. The Spectre Association dedicated \"Ultimate End\" (which served with the 16 SOS in Vietnam) on 4 May 1995.

Named ''Azrael'' for the [[Azrael|angel of death]] in [[Islamic|Islam]] who severs the soul from the body, this aircraft figured prominently in the closing hours of Operation Desert Storm. On 26 February 1991, Coalition ground forces were driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. With an Air Force Reserve crew called to active duty, Azrael was sent to the [[Highway of Death|Al Jahra highway]] (Highway 80) between [[Kuwait City]] and [[Basra]], Iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle. Facing [[SA-6]] and [[SA-8]] surface-to-air missiles and 37&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery the crew attacked and destroyed or disabled most of the convoys. ''Azrael'' was also assigned to the [[919th Special Operations Wing]] and retired to the museum in October 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=412 |title=Lockheed AC-130A Spectre |accessdate=2009-04-07 |publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025075036/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=412 |archivedate=25 October 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/071106-F-1234S-006.jpg |title=AC-130A Spectre image |publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force |author= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001323/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/071106-F-1234S-006.jpg |archivedate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nAnother AC-130A, AF serial no. 54-1626, the original prototype AC-130 named \"Gunship II\" is on display at the outdoor Air Park at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.<ref name=\"USAF Nat Museum\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/051128-F-1234P-066.jpg |title=AC-130A image |publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force |author= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022064020/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/051128-F-1234P-066.jpg |archivedate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> This aircraft served in Southeast Asia from 1967 to 1972, then served in JC-130A test configuration.

"{{Redirect|Artin's theorem|Artin's theorem on primitive elements|Primitive element theorem}}\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], an '''alternative algebra''' is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] in which multiplication need not be [[associative]], only [[alternativity|alternative]]. That is, one must have\n*<math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>\n*<math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra.\n\nEvery [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly [[non-associative algebra]]s such as the [[octonion]]s.\n\n==The associator==\n\nAlternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the [[associator]] is [[alternating form|alternating]]. The associator is a [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] given by\n:<math>[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)</math>\nBy definition a multilinear map is alternating if it [[Vanish_(mathematics)|vanishes]] whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to<ref name=Sch27>Schafer (1995) p.27</ref>\n:<math>[x,x,y] = 0</math>\n:<math>[y,x,x] = 0.</math>\nBoth of these identities together imply that the associator is totally [[skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]]. That is,\n:<math>[x_{\\sigma(1)}, x_{\\sigma(2)}, x_{\\sigma(3)}] = \\sgn(\\sigma)[x_1,x_2,x_3]</math>\nfor any [[permutation]] \u03c3. It follows that\n:<math>[x,y,x] = 0</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y''. This is equivalent to the ''[[flexible identity]]''<ref name=Sch28>Schafer (1995) p.28</ref>\n:<math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>\nThe associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:\n*left alternative identity: <math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>\n*right alternative identity: <math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>\n*flexible identity: <math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>\nis alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.\n\nAn alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the base field is not 2.\n\n==Examples==\n* Every [[associative algebra]] is alternative.\n* The [[octonion]]s form a non-associative alternative algebra, a normed division algebra of dimension 8 over the real numbers.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=John Horton Conway | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | last2=Smith | first2=Derek A. | year=2003 | title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry | publisher=A. K. Peters | isbn=1-56881-134-9 | zbl=1098.17001 }}</ref>\n* More generally, any [[octonion algebra]] is alternative.\n\n===Counter-examples===\n* The [[sedenion]]s and all higher [[Cayley-Dickson algebra]]s lose alternativity.\n* All [[Antiassociative]] algebras are by definition not alternative.\n\n==Properties==\n'''Artin's theorem''' states that in an alternative algebra the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is [[associative]].<ref name=Sch29>Schafer (1995) p.29</ref>  Conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written unambiguously without parentheses in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements <math>x,y,z</math> in an alternative algebra associate (i.e., <math>[x,y,z] = 0</math>), the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.\n\nA corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are [[power-associative]], that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative.<ref name=Sch30>Schafer (1995) p.30</ref>  The converse need not hold: the sedenions are power-associative but not alternative.\n\nThe [[Moufang identities]]\n*<math>a(x(ay)) = (axa)y</math>\n*<math>((xa)y)a = x(aya)</math>\n*<math>(ax)(ya) = a(xy)a</math>\nhold in any alternative algebra.<ref name=Sch28/>\n\nIn a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element <math>x</math> and all <math>y</math> one has\n:<math>y = x^{-1}(xy).</math>\nThis is equivalent to saying the associator <math>[x^{-1},x,y]</math> vanishes for all such <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. If <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are invertible then <math>xy</math> is also invertible with inverse <math>(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}</math>. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a [[Moufang loop]]. This ''loop of units'' in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the [[group of units]] in an associative ring or algebra.\n\nKleinfeld's theorem states that any simple non-associative alternative ring is a generalized octonion algebra over its center.<ref name=ZSSS151>Zhevlakov, Slin'ko, Shestakov, Shirshov. (1982) p.151</ref>\nThe structure theory of alternative rings is presented in <ref name=ZSSS>Zhevlakov, Slin'ko, Shestakov, Shirshov. (1982)</ref>.\n\n==Applications==\nThe projective plane over any alternative division ring is a [[Moufang plane]].\n\nThe close relationship of alternative algebras and [[composition algebra]]s was given by Guy Roos in 2008<ref>Guy Roos (2008) \"Exceptional symmetric domains\", \u00a71: Cayley algebras, in ''Symmetries in Complex Analysis'' by Bruce Gilligan & Guy Roos, volume 468 of ''Contemporary Mathematics'', [[American Mathematical Society]]</ref>: He shows (page 162) the relation for an algebra ''A'' with unit element ''e'' and an [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]] <math>a \\mapsto a^*</math> such that ''a'' + ''a''* and ''aa''* are on the line [[linear span|spanned]] by ''e'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. Use the notation ''n''(''a'') = ''aa''*. Then if ''n'' is a non-singular mapping into the field of ''A'', and ''A'' is alternative, then (''A,n'') is a composition algebra.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Zorn ring]]\n* [[Maltsev algebra]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Cite book | first = Richard D. | last = Schafer | title = An Introduction to Nonassociative Algebras | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-486-68813-5}}\n* {{cite book | first1=K.A. | last1=Zhevlakov | first2=A.M.|last2= Slin'ko | first3= I.P. | last3= Shestakov |first4 =A.I. | last4= Shirshov |year=1982 | origyear=1978 | zbl=0487.17001 |mr = 0518614 | title=Rings that are nearly associative | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | isbn=0-12-779850-1 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{SpringerEOM|id=Alternative_rings_and_algebras|first=K.A.|last= Zhevlakov|title=Alternative rings and algebras}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alternative Algebra}}\n[[Category:Non-associative algebras]]", "sha1": "dgd0kxxgymqjh213r4fo1gg4nprog4b"}}, {"title": "Arbitrage", "ns": "0", "id": "3162", "revision": {"id": "863406419", "parentid": "851656184", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T15:57:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Csgir", "id": "34103082"}, "comment": "/* Arbitrage-free */ added missing article.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About||the film|Arbitrage (film)}}\n{{Distinguish|Arbitration}}\nIn [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''arbitrage''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0r|b|\u1d7b|t|r|\u0251\u02d0|\u0292}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|-|t|r|\u026a|d\u0292}}) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more [[Market (economics)|markets]]: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the [[market price]]s. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative [[cash flow]] at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.\n\nIn principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in [[statistical arbitrage]], it may refer to ''expected'' profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always [[#Risks|risks]] in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). In academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a ''single'' asset or ''identical'' cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between ''similar'' assets ([[relative value (economics)|relative value]] or [[convergence trade]]s), as in [[merger arbitrage]].\n\nPeople who engage in arbitrage are called '''arbitrageurs''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0251\u02d0r|b|\u1d7b|t|r|\u0251\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0292|\u025c\u02d0r}}\u2014such as a bank or brokerage firm. The term is mainly applied to trading in [[financial instrument]]s, such as [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[stock]]s, [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[Commodity|commodities]] and [[Currency|currencies]].\n\nArbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Arbitrage\" is a French word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. (In modern French, \"{{lang|fr|arbitre}}\" usually means [[referee]] or [[umpire]].) In the sense used here, it was first defined in 1704 by [[Mathieu de la Porte]] in his treatise \"{{lang|fr|La science des n\u00e9gociants et teneurs de livres}}\" as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognise the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange (\"{{lang|fr|L'arbitrage est une combinaison que l\u2019on fait de plusieurs changes, pour connoitre}} [{{lang|fr|conna\u00eetre}}, in modern spelling] {{lang|fr|quelle place est plus avantageuse pour tirer et remettre}}\".)<ref>See \"Arbitrage\" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/arbitrage Tr\u00e9sor de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise].</ref>\n\n==Arbitrage-free==\nIf the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an '''arbitrage equilibrium''', or an '''arbitrage-free''' market. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a [[general equilibrium|general economic equilibrium]]. The \"no arbitrage\" assumption is used in [[quantitative finance]] to calculate a unique [[risk neutral]] price for [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corespreads.com/knowledge-base/arbitrage/|title=Arbitrage \u2013 Knowledge Base|website=www.corespreads.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Arbitrage-free pricing approach for bonds==\nThis refers to the method of valuing a coupon-bearing financial instrument by discounting its future cash flows by multiple discount rates. By doing so, a more accurate price can be obtained than if the price is calculated with a present-value pricing approach. Arbitrage-free pricing is used for bond valuation and to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors.\n\nFor the purpose of valuing the price of a bond, its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity, being the principal. Since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods, they must be discounted back to the present. In the present-value approach, the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond. In arbitrage-free pricing, multiple discount rates are used.\n\nThe present-value approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity. This is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future, which in turn affects the yield on the bond. The discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason. Each cash flow can be considered a zero-coupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity. The discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zero-coupon bonds with maturity dates the same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued. By using multiple discount rates, the arbitrage-free price is the sum of the [[discounted cash flow]]s. Arbitrage-free price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible.\n\nThe ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zero-coupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve. The yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. This curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. In arbitrage-free pricing of a bond, a yield curve of similar zero-coupon bonds with different maturities is created. If the curve were to be created with Treasury securities of different maturities, they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. This is to transform the bonds into zero-coupon bonds. The yield of these zero-coupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the ''x''-axis and yield on the ''y''-axis.\n\nSince the yield curve displays market expectations on how yields and interest rates may move, the arbitrage-free pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate. Investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices, resulting in an arbitrage opportunity. If a bond valued with the arbitrage-free pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market, an investor could have such an opportunity:\n#Investor goes short the bond at price at time t<sub>1</sub>.\n#Investor goes long the zero-coupon bonds making up the related yield curve and strip and sell any coupon payments at t<sub>1</sub>.\n#As t>t<sub>1</sub> the price spread between the prices will decrease.\n#At maturity the prices will converge and be equal. Investor exits both the long and short position, realizing a profit.\n\nIf the outcome from the valuation were the reversed case, the opposite positions would be taken in the bonds. This arbitrage opportunity comes from the assumption that the prices of bonds with the same properties will converge upon maturity. This can be explained through market efficiency, which states that arbitrage opportunities will eventually be discovered and corrected accordingly. The prices of the bonds in t<sub>1</sub> move closer together to finally become the same at t<sub>T</sub>.\n\n==Conditions for arbitrage==\nArbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:\n\n#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets (\"[[law of one price|the law of one price]]\").\n#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.\n#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price [[Discounting|discounted]] at the [[risk-free interest rate]] (or, the asset has significant costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for [[security (finance)|securities]]).\n\nArbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. The transactions must occur ''simultaneously'' to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved. Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.<ref group=\"note\">As an arbitrage consists of at least two trades, the metaphor is of putting on a pair of pants, one leg (trade) at a time. The risk that one trade (leg) fails to execute is thus 'leg risk'.</ref>\n\nIn the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. [[Merchant|Traders]] may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. \"True\" arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.\n\nSee [[rational pricing]], particularly [[rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics|\u00a7 arbitrage mechanics]], for further discussion.\n\nMathematically it is defined as follows:\n\n: <math>P(V_t \\geq 0) = 1 \\text{ and } P(V_t \\neq 0) > 0 \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>V_0 = 0</math> and <math>V_t</math> denotes the portfolio value at time&nbsp;''t''.\n\n==Price convergence==\nArbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency [[exchange rate]]s, the price of [[Commodity|commodities]], and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge. The speed<ref name=DamghaniCointelation>{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2013|title= The Non-Misleading Value of Inferred Correlation: An Introduction to the Cointelation Model |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2013 |issue=1 |pages=50\u201361 |doi= 10.1002/wilm.10252}}</ref> at which they do so is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce [[price discrimination]] by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high (as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets).\n\nArbitrage moves different currencies toward [[purchasing power parity]]. As an example, assume that a car purchased in the United States is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, then sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American dollars to buy the cars and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange. Both actions would increase demand for US dollars and supply of Canadian dollars. As a result, there would be an appreciation of the US currency. This would make US cars more expensive and Canadian cars less so until their prices were similar. On a larger scale, international arbitrage opportunities in [[commodity|commodities]], goods, [[Security (finance)|securities]] and [[currency|currencies]] tend to change [[exchange rate]]s until the [[purchasing power]] is equal.\n\nIn reality, most [[asset]]s exhibit some difference between countries. These, [[transaction cost]]s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage. Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciation in the currencies relative to each other (see [[interest rate parity]]).\n\n==Risks==\nArbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations,<ref name=DamghaniCointelation /> particularly [[Financial crisis|financial crises]], and can lead to [[bankruptcy]]. Formally, arbitrage transactions have [[negative skew]] \u2013 prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.\n\nThe main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails \u2013 execution risk. The main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk \u2013 that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] and does not have the money to do so.\n\nIn the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as [[limits to arbitrage]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shleifer|first1=Andrei|first2=Robert|last2=Vishny|year=1997|title=The limits of arbitrage|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=52|pages=35\u201355|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb03807.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.184.9959}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=Wei|year=2001|title=Convergence trading with wealth effects|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=62|issue=2|pages=247\u2013292|doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(01)00078-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kondor|first1=Peter|year=2009|title=Risk in Dynamic Arbitrage: Price Effects of Convergence Trading|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=64|issue=2|pages=638\u2013658|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01445.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.688}}</ref>\n\n===Execution risk===\nGenerally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and inter-dealer brokers allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE).\n\nCompetition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions. As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE.  This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[risk arbitrage]] was common. In this form of [[speculation]], one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price\u2014if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. One way of reducing this risk is through the [[Insider trading|illegal use of inside information]], and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to [[leveraged buyout]]s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]].\n\n===Mismatch===\n{{details|Convergence trade}}\nAnother risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a [[convergence trade]]. In the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.\n\n===Counterparty risk===\nAs arbitrages generally involve ''future'' movements of cash, they are subject to [[counterparty risk]]: if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction. This is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty, whose failure thus poses a threat, or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail. This hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences.\n\nFor example, if one purchases many risky bonds, then hedges them with [[Credit default swap|CDSes]], profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the CDS premium, in a financial crisis the bonds may default ''and'' the CDS writer/seller may itself fail, due to the stress of the crisis, causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses.\n\n===Liquidity risk===\n{{rquote|right|Markets can remain irrational far longer than you or I can remain solvent.|[[John Maynard Keynes]]}}\nArbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic, ''leveraged'' trades, as they involve a short position. If the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] (faces a [[margin call]]), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. In effect, arbitrage traders synthesize a [[put option]] on their ability to finance themselves.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.purearb.com/purearb/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/desco_market_insights_vol_1_no_1_20090313.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Basis Monster That Ate Wall Street|publisher=[[D. E. Shaw & Co.]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nPrices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a \"[[flight to quality]]\"; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most.<ref name=\"bm\" />\n\n==Types of arbitrage==\n\n===Spatial arbitrage===\nAlso known as '''geographical arbitrage''', this is the simplest form of arbitrage. In spatial arbitrage, an arbitrageur looks for price differences between geographically separate markets. For example, there may be a bond dealer in Virginia offering a bond at 100-12/23 and a dealer in Washington bidding 100-15/23 for the same bond. For whatever reason, the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices, but the arbitrageur does. The arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the Virginia dealer and sells it to the Washington dealer.\n\n===Merger arbitrage===\nAlso called [[risk arbitrage]], merger arbitrage generally consists of buying/holding the stock of a company that is the target of a [[takeover]] while [[Short (finance)|shorting]] the stock of the acquiring company.\n\nUsually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.\nThe spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.\n\nThe bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.  The risk is that the deal \"breaks\" and the spread massively widens.\n\n===Municipal bond arbitrage===\nAlso called ''municipal bond relative value arbitrage'', ''municipal arbitrage'', or just ''muni arb'', this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches. The term \"arbitrage\" is also used in the context of the Income Tax Regulations governing the investment of proceeds of municipal bonds; these regulations, aimed at the issuers or beneficiaries of tax-exempt municipal bonds, are different and, instead, attempt to remove the issuer's ability to arbitrage between the low tax-exempt rate and a taxable investment rate.\n\nGenerally, managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a duration-neutral book. The relative value trades may be between different issuers, different bonds issued by the same entity, or capital structure trades referencing the same asset (in the case of revenue bonds). Managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of non-economic investors (i.e., high income \"[[buy and hold]]\" investors seeking tax-exempt income) as well as the \"crossover buying\" arising from corporations' or individuals' changing income tax situations (i.e., insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher after-tax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses). There are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and 50,000 issuers, in contrast to the Treasury market which has 400 issues and a single issuer.\n\nSecond, managers construct leveraged portfolios of AAA- or AA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by [[Short selling|shorting]] the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds. These corporate equivalents are typically [[interest rate swap]]s referencing [[Libor#Libor-based derivatives|Libor]] or [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association|SIFMA]] [http://www.investinginbonds.com/story.asp?id=351] [http://www.bondmarkets.com/story.asp?id=1157]. The arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. The steeper slope of the municipal [[yield curve]] allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments\u2014municipal bonds and interest rate swaps\u2014will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency. Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. However, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.\n\nNote, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.\n\n===Convertible bond arbitrage===\nA [[convertible bond]] is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.\n\nA convertible bond can be thought of as a [[corporate bond]] with a stock [[call option]] attached to it.\n\nThe price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:\n\n*''[[interest rate]]''. When rates move higher, the bond part of a convertible bond tends to move lower, but the call option part of a convertible bond moves higher (and the aggregate tends to move lower).\n*''stock price''. When the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher, the price of the bond tends to rise.\n*''[[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]''. If the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates (e.g. [[credit rating agency|rating]] downgrade) and its credit spread widens, the bond price tends to move lower, but, in many cases, the call option part of the convertible bond moves higher (since credit spread correlates with volatility).\n\nGiven the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.\n\n[[Convertible arbitrage]] consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.\n\nFor instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell [[fixed income]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] or [[interest rate future]]s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some [[credit default swap|credit protection]] (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).\nEventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.\nHe could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or [[delta hedging]] his exposure to the underlying shares.\n\n===Depository receipts===\nA [[depositary receipt]] is a security that is offered as a \"tracking stock\" on another foreign market. For instance, a [[China|Chinese]] company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs ([[American depositary receipt]]) or GDRs ([[global depository receipt]]) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered \"foreign\" and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as [[fungibility]]) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.\n\n===Cross-border arbitrage===\nCross-border arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries:\n\nExample: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is trading on [[NASDAQ]] at US$108.84. The stock is also traded on the German electronic exchange, [[Xetra (trading system)|XETRA]]. If 1 euro costs US$1.11, a cross-border trader could enter a buy order on the XETRA at \u20ac98.03 per Apple share and a sell order at \u20ac98.07 per share.\n\nSome brokers in Germany do not offer access to the U.S. exchanges. Hence if a German retail investor wants to buy Apple stock, he needs to buy it on the XETRA. The cross-border trader would sell the Apple shares on XETRA to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on NASDAQ. Afterwards, the cross-border trader would need to transfer the shares bought on NASDAQ to the German XETRA exchange, where he is obliged to deliver the stock.\n\nIn most cases, the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by [[High-frequency trading|high-frequency traders]], taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the [[exchange rate]]. This kind of high-frequency trading benefits the public as it reduces the cost to the German investor and enables him to buy U.S. shares.\n\n===Dual-listed companies===\nA [[dual-listed company]] (DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive [[margin call]]s, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. Arbitrage in DLCs may be profitable, but is also very risky.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=A.|first2=L.|last2=Rosenthal|first3=M.A.|last3=van Dijk|date=June 2008|title=The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies|ssrn=525282|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathijsavandijk.com/dual-listed-companies/ |author=Mathijs A. van Dijk |title=Dual-listed Companies |accessdate=January 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA good illustration of the risk of DLC arbitrage is the position in [[Royal Dutch Shell]]\u2014which had a DLC structure until 2005\u2014by the hedge fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowenstein|first1=R.|year=2000|title=When genius failed: The rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management|publisher=Random House}}</ref> describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total, $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was long in Shell and the other half was short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p.&nbsp;99). In the autumn of 1998, large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p.&nbsp;234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity [[pairs trading]] and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] trade.\n\n===Private to public equities===\nThe market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a [[Price to earnings ratio]] (P/E) (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% [[Return on investment|ROI]]). Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. E.g., [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and [[Halydean Corporation]]. Private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to [[investment banking]] in general.  Private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an [[initial public offering]] (IPO).\n\n===Regulatory arbitrage===\n{{details|Jurisdictional arbitrage}}\nRegulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) [[risk]] and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the [[Basel I]] accord, has to hold 8% capital against [[default risk]], but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to [[Securitization|securitise]] the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. Regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.\n\nThis process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by [[Alan Greenspan]] in his October 1998 speech on [http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation].\n\nThe term \"Regulatory Arbitrage\" was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.\n\nIn economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an [[insurance]] company may choose to locate in [[Bermuda]] due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location. In the case of many financial products, it may be unclear \"where\" the transaction occurs.\n\nRegulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as IT. The outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. This frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. The bank will have higher IT costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of [[money creation]] and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.\n\nExample:\nSuppose the bank sells its IT installations for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.\n\nAccording to PBS Frontline's 2012 four-part documentary, \"Money, Power, and Wall Street,\" regulatory arbitrage, along with asymmetric bank lobbying in Washington and abroad, allowed investment banks in the pre- and post-2008 period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives, swaps, and other credit-based instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients, government, and publics.\n\nDue to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage, one form of Regulatory Arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in \u201cMedicaid Migration\u201d, a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in Medicaid instead. These programs that have similar characteristics as insurance products to the employee, but have radically different cost structures, resulting in significant expense reductions for employers.<ref>{{cite news|title=What is Medicaid migration and how does it apply to brokers?|date=June 25, 2014|url=http://www.benefitnews.com/blog/beadvised/what-is-medicaid-migration-and-how-does-it-apply-to-brokers-2742350-1.html|work=Employee Benefit News}}</ref>\n\n===Telecom arbitrage===\n{{main|International telecommunications routes}}\n\nTelecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers. Such services are offered in the United Kingdom; the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the UK mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost. The calls are seen as free by the UK contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls.\n\nSuch services were previously offered in the United States by companies such as FuturePhone.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2560255|accessdate=2008-12-23|title=Free International Calls!

LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. For example, it would sell [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] and buy Italian bond futures. The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge. Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.\n\nThe downfall in this system began on August 17, 1998, when [[Russia]] defaulted on its [[Russian ruble|ruble]] debt and domestic dollar debt. Because the markets were already nervous due to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], investors began selling non-U.S. treasury  debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment. As a result, the price on US treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell). This caused the difference between the prices of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting. Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the [[Federal Reserve]] assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system. Thus LTCM failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed LTCM out.\n\n==See also==\n\n===Types of financial arbitrage===\n* [[Arbitrage betting]]\n* [[Covered interest arbitrage]]\n* [[Fixed income arbitrage]]\n* [[Political arbitrage]]\n* [[Remarketing arbitrage]]\n* [[Risk arbitrage]]\n* [[Statistical arbitrage]]\n* [[Triangular arbitrage]]\n* [[Uncovered interest arbitrage]]\n* [[Volatility arbitrage]]\n\n===Related concepts===\n* [[Airline booking ploys]]\n* [[Algorithmic trading]]\n* [[Arbitrage pricing theory]]\n* [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)]], analogous concept in [[Bayesian probability]]\n* Cointelation\n* [[Drop shipping]]\n* [[Efficient-market hypothesis]]\n* [[Immunization (finance)]]\n* [[Interest rate parity]]\n* [[Intermediation]]\n* [[No free lunch with vanishing risk]]\n* [[TANSTAAFL]]\n* [[Value investing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Greider, William (1997).

Founded by a merger in August 1926, and refounded in August 2002 following bankruptcy, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more [[Serie A]] seasons.\n\nFiorentina has won two [[List of Italian football champions|Italian Championships]], in [[1955\u201356 Serie A|1955\u201356]] and again in [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369]], as well as six [[Coppa Italia]] trophies and one [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. On the [[UEFA|European stage]], Fiorentina won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960\u201361]] and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the [[1956\u201357 European Cup]], losing against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and also came close to winning the [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup]], finishing as runners-up against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] after losing the first leg in [[Turin]] and drawing in the second one in [[Avellino]].\n\nFiorentina is one of the fourteen European teams that played the finals in all three major continental competitions: the Champions League (1956\u20131957, the first Italian team to reach the final in the top continental competition), the UEFA Cup Winners (1960\u20131961 and 1961\u20131962) and the UEFA Cup (1989\u20131990).\n\nSince 1931, the club have played at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently has a capacity of 43,147. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname ''Viola'', a reference to their distinctive purple colours.\n\n==History==\n{{details|History of ACF Fiorentina}}\n\n===Foundation to World War II===\n[[File:Associazione Calcio Fiorentina 1940-1941.jpg|thumb|left|1940\u201341 Fiorentina team]]\n\n'''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina''' was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and [[National Fascist Party]] member Luigi Ridolfi,<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Simon| title =Football and Fascism: The National Game Under Mussolini| publisher = Berg Publishers| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=LSOmTCa8g50C&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=fiorentina+Luigi+Ridolfi+fascist&source=web&ots=-TY6RPJtWP&sig=plBjFJCYajFpO1RG3DF128PVB7E&hl=en| isbn = 1-85973-705-6}}</ref> who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, [[C.S. Firenze|CS Firenze]] and [[P.G. Libertas|PG Libertas]]. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant [[Italian Football Championship]] sides of the time from [[Northern Italy|Northwest Italy]]. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of ''[[Calcio Fiorentino]]'', an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the [[Medici]] family.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nAfter a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached the Serie A in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named after Giovanni Berta, a prominent fascist, but now known as [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]]. At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. To be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the Uruguayan [[Pedro Petrone]], nicknamed ''el Artillero''. Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941, they won their first [[Coppa Italia]], but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.\n\n===First ''scudetto'' and '50\u2013'60s===\n[[File:Fiorentina scudetto.jpg|thumb|The first Italian champion Fiorentina]]\n\nIn 1950, Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper [[Giuliano Sarti]], [[Sergio Cervato]], Francesco Rosella, [[Guido Gratton]], [[Giuseppe Chiappella]] and Aldo Scaramucci but above all, the attacking duo of Brazilian [[J\u00falio Botelho|Julinho]] and Argentinian [[Miguel Montuori]]. This team won Fiorentina's first ''[[scudetto]]'' (Italian championship) in [[1955\u201356 Serie A|1955\u201356]], 12 points ahead of second-place [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2\u20130 defeat at the hands of [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].\nFiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the [[1960\u201361 Serie A|1960\u201361 season]], the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first [[Cup Winners' Cup]] against Scottish side [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nAfter several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1966.\n\n===Second ''scudetto'' and '70s===\n[[File:Giancarlo Antognoni (3).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Giancarlo Antognoni]], former captain of Fiorentina]]\n\nWhile the 1960s did result in some trophies and good [[Serie A]] finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369 season]] started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and were overtaken by [[Gigi Riva]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]]. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2\u20132 draw against [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]], leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in [[Turin]] on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3\u20130 defeat in [[Glasgow]] to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Prediksi Skor Serie A, Fiorentina Vs Genoa 29 Januari 2017|url=http://viralbola.com/prediksi-skor-serie-a-fiorentina-vs-genoa-29-januari-2017/|publisher=Viralbola.com}}</ref>\n\n''Viola'' players began the 1970s decade with ''Scudetto'' sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The ''Viola'' did win the [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young average age of the players led to the team being called ''Fiorentina Ye-Ye''.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pontello era===\n[[File:Fiorentina-Circle-Logo.png|thumb|upright|The new team logo of the period]]\n\nIn 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as [[Francesco Graziani]] and [[Eraldo Pecci]] from [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]; [[Daniel Bertoni]] from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]; [[Daniele Massaro]] from [[A.C. Monza Brianza 1912|Monza]]; and a young [[Pietro Vierchowod]] from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in [[1981\u201382 Serie A|1982]], Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals Juventus. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.\n\nThe following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, ''El Puntero'' [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] and, most significantly, the young [[Roberto Baggio]].\n\nIn 1990, Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final, where they again faced Juventus. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's ''[[tifosi]]'' once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in [[Avellino]] (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with many Juventus fans, and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker [[Mario Cecchi Gori]].\n\n===Cecchi Gori era: from Champions League to bankruptcy===\n[[File:Gabriel batistuta.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gabriel Batistuta]], the most prominent Fiorentina player of the 1990s]]\n\nThe first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Stefan Effenberg]], [[Francesco Baiano]] and, most importantly, [[Gabriel Batistuta]], who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori|Vittorio]]. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, [[Luigi Radice]], after a defeat against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/gennaio/04/Fiorentina_caduta_sugli_allori_co_0_9301043372.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera}}</ref> and replaced him with [[Aldo Agroppi]]. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.\n\n[[Claudio Ranieri]] was brought in as coach for the 1993\u201394 season, and that year, Fiorentina dominated [[Serie B]], Italy's second division. Upon their return to Serie A, Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent [[Rui Costa]] from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and the new world champion Brazilian defender [[M\u00e1rcio Roberto dos Santos|M\u00e1rcio Santos]]. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The ''Viola'' finished the season in tenth place.\n\nThe following season, Cecchi Gori bought other important players, namely Swedish midfielder [[Stefan Schwarz]]. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finishing joint-third in Serie A. In the summer, Fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the [[Supercoppa Italiana]], defeating Milan 2\u20131 at the [[San Siro]].\n\nFiorentina's 1995\u201396 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-final by beating [[AF Gloria Bistri\u021ba|Gloria Bistri\u021ba]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (away 1\u20131; home 0\u20132). The season's main signings were [[Lu\u00eds Oliveira]] and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]], the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.\n\nAt the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in Spain, with Cecchi Gori appointing [[Alberto Malesani]] as his replacement. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in [[1998\u201399 Serie A|1998\u201399]] but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. The following year was disappointing in Serie A, but ''Viola'' played some historical matches in the Champions League, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130 at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2\u20130 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.\n\nAt the end of the season, Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach [[Fatih Terim]]. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301]] and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of [[Roberto Mancini]]. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.\n\nThe year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. The club's owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the [[2001\u201302 Serie A|2001\u201302 season]] and went into judicially-controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the [[2002\u201303 Serie A|2002\u201303 season]], and as a result effectively ceased to exist.\n\n===The 2000s: Della Valle era===\nThe club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as '''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola''' with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner and the club was admitted into [[Serie C2]], the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was [[Angelo Di Livio]], whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker [[Christian Rigan\u00f2]], the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to [[Serie C1]]. Due to the bizarre ''[[Calcio Catania#Decline and revival|Caso Catania]]'' (Catania Case), however, the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC)'s decision to resolve the [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for \"sports merits.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html |publisher=La Repubblica |language=Italian |title=Serie B a 24 squadre.

The club finished the [[2003\u201304 Serie B|2003\u201304 season]] in sixth place and won the [[Playoffs#Association football|playoff]] against [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] to return to top-flight football.\n[[File:Cesare Prandelli.JPG|thumb|[[Cesare Prandelli]], the club's longest-serving manager (2005\u20132010)]]\n\nIn their first season back in Serie A, however, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint [[Pantaleo Corvino]] as new sports director, followed by the appointment of [[Cesare Prandelli]] as head coach in [[2005\u201306 Serie A|the following season]]. The club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably [[Luca Toni]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Frey]]. This drastic move earned them a fourth-place finish with 74 points and a Champions League qualifying round ticket. Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since [[Antonio Valentin Angelillo]] in the [[1958\u201359 Serie A|1958\u201359 season]], for which he was awarded the [[European Golden Boot]]. On 14 July 2006, however, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the [[2006 Serie A scandal|2006 Serie A match fixing scandal]] and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the [[2006\u201307 Serie A|2006\u201307 season]]. The team's [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006\u201307 Champions League]] place was also revoked.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5164194.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Italian trio relegated to Serie B | date=14 July 2006| accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref> After the start of the season, Fiorentina's penalisation was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts. In spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup.\n\nDespite Toni's departure to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Fiorentina had a strong start to the [[2007\u201308 Serie A|2007\u201308 season]] and were tipped by [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] head coach [[Marcello Lippi]], among others, as a surprise challenger for the ''[[Scudetto]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=472919|publisher=Goal.com|title=Lippi Tips Fiorentina For Surprise Scudetto Challenge|date=11 November 2007}}</ref> and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the ''Viola'' managed to qualify for the Champions League. In Europe, the club reached the semi-final of the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where they were ultimately defeated by Rangers on penalties. The [[2008\u201309 Serie A|2008\u201309 season]] continued this success, a fourth-place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|2010's Champions League playoffs]]. Their European campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]] and were eliminated by [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the end.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|2009\u201310 season]], Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] home and away). The ''Viola'' qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the [[away goals rule]]. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by [[Tom Henning \u00d8vreb\u00f8]], who allowed a clearly offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|final]]. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.\n\nDuring this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's vice-president until a permanent position could be filled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Fiorentina/24-09-2009/della-valle-si-dimesso--501388850534.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|title=Fiorentina senza presidente Della Valle si \u00e8 dimesso|date=24 September 2009|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n===The 2010s: Post-Prandelli Era===\n[[File:Vincenzo montella (1).JPG|thumb|upright|left|Former manager [[Vincenzo Montella]].]]\n\nIn June 2010, the ''Viola'' bid farewell to long-time manager Cesar Prandelli, by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history, who was departing to coach the Italian national team. Catania manager [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]] was appointed to replace him. The club spent much of the early [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]] in last place, but their form improved and Fiorentina ultimately finished ninth. Following a 1\u20130 defeat to [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]] in November 2011, Mihajlovi\u0107 was sacked and replaced by [[Delio Rossi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/07/sport/football/football-fiorentina-mihajlovic/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Mihajlovic sacked as Fiorentina coach|date=7 November 2011}}</ref> After a brief period of improvements, the ''Viola'' were again fighting relegation, prompting the sacking of Sporting Director [[Pantaleo Corvino]] in early 2012 following a 0\u20135 home defeat to Juventus. Their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, notably at Roma and Milan. During a home game against [[Novara Calcio|Novara]], trailing 0\u20132 within half an hour, manager Rossi decided to substitute midfielder [[Adem Ljaji\u0107]] early. Ljaji\u0107 sarcastically applauded him in frustration, whereupon Rossi retaliated by physical assaulting his player, an action that ultimately prompted his termination by the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17933945|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Fiorentina boss Delio Rossi sacked for attacking player|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> His replacement, caretaker manager [[Vincenzo Guerini]], then guided the team away from the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish to end the turbulent year.\n\nTo engineer a resurrection of the club after the disappointing season, the Della Valle family invested heavily in the middle of 2012, buying 17 new players and appointing [[Vincenzo Montella]] as head coach. The team began the season well, finishing the calendar year in joint third place and eventually finishing the [[2012\u201313 Serie A|2012\u201313 season]] in fourth, enough for a position in the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|2013\u201314 Europa League]].\n\nThe club lost fan favourite [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] during the middle of 2013, selling him to English Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for a \u20ac30&nbsp;million transfer fee. They also sold Adem Ljaji\u0107 to Roma and [[Alessio Cerci]] to Torino, using the funds to bring in [[Mario G\u00f3mez]], [[Josip Ili\u010di\u0107]] and [[Ante Rebi\u0107]], among others. During the season, Fiorentina topped their Europa League group, moving on to the round of 32 to face Danish side [[Esbjerg fB]], which Fiorentina defeated 4\u20132 on aggregate. In the following round of 16, however, they then lost to Italian rivals Juventus 2\u20131 on aggregate, ousting Fiorentina from the competition. At the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing the year as Coppa Italia runners-up after losing 3\u20131 to Napoli in the final.\n\nIn 2014\u201315, during the 2015 winter transfer window, the team club sold star winger [[Juan Cuadrado]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for \u20ac30&nbsp;million but were able to secure the loan of [[Mohamed Salah]] in exchange, who was a revelation in the second half of the season. Their [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League|2014\u201315 Europa League campaign]] saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Spanish side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], the eventual champions. In the [[2014\u201315 Serie A|2014\u201315 domestic season]], Fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League|2015\u201316 Europa League]]. In June 2015, [[Vincenzo Montella]] was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/67539/official-fiorentina-sack-montella|title=Official: Fiorentina sack Montella \u2013 Football Italia}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Paulo Sousa]], who lasted until June 2017 and the appointment of [[Stefano Pioli]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Stefano Pioli: Fiorentina hire former Inter Milan and Lazio boss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40176919|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 June 2017}}</ref> Club captain [[Davide Astori]] died suddenly at the age of 31 in March 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Elliot C.|title=Fiorentina captain Davide Astori dies of 'sudden illness' at 31, team says|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/04/football/italian-footballer-fiorentina-davide-astori-dies/index.html|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=CNN|date=4 March 2018}}</ref> The club subsequently retired Astori's kit number, 13.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/acffiorentina/status/970939765641154560|title=Per onorarne la memoria e rendere indelebile il ricordo di Davide Astori, @CagliariCalcio e Fiorentina hanno deciso di ritirare congiuntamente la maglia con il numero 13. #DA13pic.twitter.com/KXP6s8WFlG|last=Fiorentina|first=A.

[[fleur-de-lis]] on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.\n\nOver the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's fleur-de-lis in some way.<ref name=\"logo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3001|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylised fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about 20 years, had been a white [[lozenge]] with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the ''[[scudetto]]''.\n\nThe logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of Florence's emblem and one-half of the letter \"F\", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a [[halberd]] than a fleur-de-lis.<ref name=\"logo\"/>\n\nToday's logo is a kite shaped double [[lozenge]] bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters \"AC\" in white and the letter \"F\" in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence.<ref name=\"logo\"/> This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's ''[[comune]]'' instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylised coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of \u20ac2.5&nbsp;million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.\n\n===Kit and colours===\n[[File:Omar Batistuta.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gabriel Batistuta]] holding his old Fiorentina jersey at a 2014 ceremony inducting him into the club\u2019s hall of fame]]\nWhen Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/048/017/stemma.html|publisher=Comuni-Italiani|title=Stemma Comune di Firenze|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname ''La Viola'' (\"The Purple (team)\"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.\n\nThe away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first worn in the 1995\u201396 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two [[lily|lilies]] on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97\u2013'98, '99\u2013'00 and '10\u2013'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the [[Coppa Italia]], in 2000\u201301.\n\nFor the 2017\u201318 season and the first time in its history, the club used five kits during the season, composing of one home kit (all-purple) and four away kits, each one representing one historic [[quartiere]] of the city of [[Florence]]: all-blue (Santa Croce), all-white (Santo Spirito), all-green (San Giovanni) and all-red (Santa Maria Novella).<ref>{{cite news|title=First Club With 5 Player Kits \u2013 ACF Fiorentina 17\u201318 Home + 4 Away Kits Released|url=http://www.footyheadlines.com/2017/07/first-club-with-5-player-kits-acf-fiorentina-17-18-home-and-4-away-kits.html|accessdate=8 July 2017|publisher=Footy Headlines|date=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Kit manufacturer and sponsors==\n\n===Kit manufacturer===\n* 1981\u20131983: [[Adidas]]\n* 1983\u20131985: J.D.Farrow's\n* 1983\u20131988: Ennerre\n* 1988\u20131991: Abbigliamento Sportivo\n* 1991\u20131993: [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]\n* 1993\u20131995: [[Uhlsport]]\n* 1995\u20131997: [[Reebok]]\n* 1997\u20132000: [[Fila (company)|Fila]]\n* 2000\u20132001: [[Diadora]]\n* 2001\u20132002: [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]]\n* 2002\u20132003: [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]], [[Garman]], [[Puma SE|Puma]]\n* 2003\u20132005: [[Adidas]]\n* 2005\u20132012: [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]\n* 2012\u20132015: [[Joma]]\n* 2015\u2013: [[Le Coq Sportif]]\n\n===Kit sponsors===\n* 1981\u20131983: J.D.Farrow's\n* 1983\u20131986: [[Opel]]\n* 1986\u20131989: [[Crodino]]\n* 1989\u20131991: [[La Nazione]]\n* 1991\u20131992: Giocheria\n* 1992\u20131994: [[7up]]\n* 1994\u20131997: Sammontana\n* 1997\u20131999: [[Nintendo]]\n* 1999\u20132002: [[Toyota]]\n* 2002\u20132004: [[Fondiaria-Sai]]\n* 2004\u20132010: [[Toyota]]\n* 2010\u20132011: [[Save The Children]]\n* 2011\u20132014: [[Mazda]]\n* 2014\u20132016: [[Volkswagen]], [[Save The Children]]\n* 2016\u2013present: [[Vorwerk (company)|Vorwerk Folletto]], [[Save The Children]]\n\n==Honours==\n\n===National titles===\n'''[[Serie A]]:'''\n* '''Winners (2)''': [[1955\u201356 Serie A|1955\u201356]]; [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369]]\n* ''Runners-up (5)'': [[1956\u201357 Serie A|1956\u201357]]; [[1957\u201358 Serie A|1957\u201358]]; [[1958\u201359 Serie A|1958\u201359]]; [[1959\u201360 Serie A|1959\u201360]]; [[1981\u201382 Serie A|1981\u201382]]\n\n'''[[Serie B]]'''\n* '''Winners (3)''': [[1930\u201331 Serie B|1930\u201331]]; [[1938\u201339 Serie B|1938\u201339]]; [[1993\u201394 Serie B|1993\u201394]]\n\n'''[[Lega Pro Seconda Divisione|Serie C2]]''' (as ''Florentia Viola'')\n* '''Winners (1)''': 2002\u201303\n\n'''[[Coppa Italia]]:'''\n* '''Winners (6)''': 1939\u201340; 1960\u201361; 1965\u201366; 1974\u201375; [[1995\u201396 Coppa Italia|1995\u201396]]; [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|2000\u201301]]\n\n'''[[Supercoppa Italiana]]:'''\n* '''Winners (1)''': [[1996 Supercoppa Italiana|1996]]\n* ''Runners-up (1)'': [[2001 Supercoppa Italiana|2001]]\n\n===European titles===\n{{further|ACF Fiorentina in European football}}\n'''[[European Cup]]:'''\n* ''Runners-up (1)'': [[1956-57 European Cup|1956\u201357]]\n\n'''[[UEFA Cup]]:'''\n* ''Runners-up (1)'': [[1989-90 UEFA Cup|1989\u201390]]\n\n'''[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]:'''\n* '''Winners (1)''': [[1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960\u201361]]\n* ''Runners-up (1)'': [[1961\u201362 European Cup Winners' Cup|1961\u201362]]\n\n===Minor titles===\n'''Coppa Grasshoppers'''\n* '''Winners (1)''': 1957\n\n'''[[Mitropa Cup]]'''\n* '''Winners (1)''': 1966\n* ''Runners-up (2)'': 1965, 1972\n\n'''[[Anglo-Italian League Cup]]'''\n* '''Winners (1)''': 1975\n\n==UEFA rankings==\n\n===Club coefficients===\nThis is the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA]] club's coefficient as of 6 January 2017:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/|publisher=UEFA|title=UEFA rankings for club competitions}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The Drama Review: TDR. MIT Press. 30: 131\u2013148. </ref>\n\nThe term was coined by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader [[Fela Kuti]], who is responsible for pioneering and popularizing the style both within and outside Nigeria. It was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish Fela Kuti's music from the [[soul]] music of American artists such as [[James Brown]].<ref>http://www.myjoyonline.com/entertainment/2015/october-22nd/fela-kuti-coined-afrobeat-in-accra-out-of-hate-for-james-brown-prof-john-collins.php</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAfrobeat originated from Ghanaian highlife in the early 60s.<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/album/ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-and-fusion-in-the-70s-mw0000259942</ref><ref>https://worldmusiccentral.org/2013/08/29/the-infectious-songs-of-ghanaian-afrobeat/</ref> It was later developed in the southern part of Nigeria in the late 1960s, by [[Fela Kuti]], who experimented with different contemporary music of the time. Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth.<ref>https://thinkafricapress.com/album-review-konkoma-afrobeat-highlife/</ref><ref>https://us.napster.com/blog/post/radio-afrobeat-airwaves</ref>\n\nAlthough the term Afrobeat was coined as early as 1968, after making a trip to the United States, Kuti wasn\u2019t really making music in the category of Afrobeat. The name \u201cAfrobeat\u201d shows the significance of groove to the music, as opposed to Afrofunk. \u00a0\n\nIn 1969, Kuti and his band went on a trip to the U.S. and met Sandra Smith, a singer and former Black Panther. Sandra Smith (now known as Sandra Isadore) introduced Kuti to many writings of activist such as Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis, Jesse Jackson, and his biggest influence of all Malcolm X.\n\nBeing that Kuti was interested in African American politics, Smith would inform him on the current events. In return, Kuti would fill her in on African culture. Since, Kuti stayed at Smith\u2019s house and was spending so much time with her, he started to re-evaluate his music. That was when Fela Kuti noticed that he was not playing African music. From that day forward, Kuti changed his sound and the message behind his music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander|date=2013|title=Make It Funky: Fela Kuti, James Brown and the Invention of Afrobeat|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/528297|journal=American Studies|volume=52|pages=99-118|via=Project MUSE}}</ref>\n\nPrevalent in his and [[Lagbaja]]'s music are native Nigerian harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing, and improvising upon them. [[Politics]] are essential to Afrobeat, since founder Kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. His message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 1970s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. As the genre spread throughout the African continent many bands took up the style. The recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on [[compilation album]]s and [[CD]]s from specialist record shops.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nBig band (15 to 30 pieces: Fela-era afrobeat) and energetic performances\n\n*Lead vocals (may play sax/key solos as well)\n*Chorus vocals (may include horn players)\n*[[Rhythm guitar]](s) (plays funk strumming pattern)\n*[[Tenor guitar]] (plays a finger-picked [[ostinato]] groove)\n*[[Bass guitar]]\n*[[Drum set]], generally in the form [[polyrhythmic]] percussion\n*[[Saxophone]](s)\n*[[Trumpet]](s)\n*[[Trombone]](s)\n*[[Organ (music)|Organ]]/keyboards\n*Rhythm [[conga]] #1\n*Rhythm [[conga]] #2\n*Solo (lead) [[conga]]\n*[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2414/2789/1600/Blog_akuba.jpg Akuba]: a set of 3 small stick-hit Yoruba congas (play flourishes/solos, and ostinatos).

From [[Roy Ayers]] in the 1970s to [[Randy Weston]] in the 1990s, there have been collaborations that have resulted in albums such as ''Africa: Centre of the World'' by Roy Ayers, released on the [[Polydor Records|Polydore]] label in 1981. In 1994 [[Branford Marsalis]], the American jazz saxophonist, included samples of Fela's \"Beast of No Nation\" on his ''[[Buckshot LeFonque (album)|Buckshot LeFonque]]'' album. The new generation of [[Disc jockey|DJs]] and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and [[remix]]es of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of [[Afro pop music|afropop]] and [[Groove (music)|groove]] (see [[#afrobeats|Afrobeats]] section below).\n\nAfrobeat has also profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like [[Brian Eno]] and [[David Byrne]], who credit Fela Kuti as an essential influence.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8140025/Brian-Eno-Felas-music-will-live-on-through-his-son.html</ref> Both worked on [[Talking Heads]]' highly acclaimed 1980 album ''[[Remain In Light]]'', which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to Western music.\n\nThe horn section of [[Antibalas]] have been guest musicians on [[TV On The Radio]]'s highly acclaimed 2008 album ''[[Dear Science]]'', as well as on British band [[Foals (band)|Foals]]' 2008 album, ''[[Antidotes]]''. Some Afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of [[Vampire Weekend]] and [[Paul Simon]].\n\nIn 2009 the music label Knitting Factory Records (KFR) produced the Broadway Musical ''FELA!'' As said on the musical\u2019s website, the story showcased Fela Kuti\u2019s \u201ccourage and incredible musical mastery\u201d along with the story of his life. The show had 11 Tony nominations, receiving three for Best Costumes, Best Sound and Best Choreography. ''FELA!'' Was on Broadway for fifteen months and was produced by notables such as Shawn \u201cJay-Z\u201d Carter and Will & Jada Pinkett-Smith. Many celebrities were noted on attending the shows such as, Denzel Washington, Madonna, Sting, Spike Lee (who saw it eight times), Kofi Annan, and even Michelle Obama. Michelle Williams, former singer of girl group Destiny\u2019s Child, was casted as the role of Sandra Isadore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.felaonbroadway.com/about/|title=About {{!}} FELA!

These beats harken to the stylings of a variety of traditional African drumbeats across West Africa as well as the precursory genre of Afrobeat.<ref name=\"auto\">Hancox, D. (2012). The Rise of Afrobeats. The Guardian.</ref> The beat in Afrobeats music is not just a base for the melody, but acts as a major character of the song, taking a lead role that is sometimes equal to are of greater importance than the lyrics and almost always more central than the other instrumentals. Another distinction within Afrobeats is the notably west African, specifically Nigerian or Ghanaian, accented English<ref name=\"auto\"/> that is often blended with local slangs, pidgin English, as well as local Nigerian or Ghanaian languages depending on the backgrounds of the performers. \n\nDJs and producers like DJ Black, [[Elom Adablah]], and C-Real (Cyril-Alex Gockel) for example, have been a crucial part in spreading the popularity of this form of music.<ref name=\"auto1\">Shipley, J.

Their mixing and promotion of popular hits on the continent is also a tried and true method for success. Often what the play in clubs, radio shows, podcasts, etc. are what become popularized both within Africa and abroad.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n\nSince 2012, Afrobeats have gained mainstream recognition outside of Africa, especially within the UK. UK hits have included \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\" by [[D'banj]] a [[Nigerian]] which reached 9 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2012, and \"[[Million Pound Girl (Badder Than Bad)]]\" by the [[Ghanaian British]] artist [[Fuse ODG]], which reached 5 on the UK Singles Chart in 2014.

Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known as '''C89''' or '''C90''').  Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so helps [[porting|portability]] between compilers.\n\n==History and outlook==\nThe first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, \"ANSI C\" is still used to refer to the standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.ansi.org/2017/09/origin-ansi-c-iso-c/|title=The Origin of ANSI C and ISO C|author=Brad Kelechava|accessdate=2018-08-14|date=2017-09-14}}</ref> While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards-body neutral and use Standard C.\n\n===C89===\nIn 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. The standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 \"Programming Language C.\" This version of the language is often referred to as \"ANSI C\". Later on sometimes the label \"C89\" is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.\n\n===C90===\nThe same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html|title=Standards - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> which is sometimes referred to as C90. Therefore, the terms \"C89\" and \"C90\" refer to essentially the same language.\n\nThis standard has been withdrawn by both ANSI/INCITS<ref name=\"ref1\" /> and ISO/IEC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=17782|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1990 - Programming Languages -- C|accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\n===C95===\nIn 1995, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published an extension, called Amendment&nbsp;1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ''ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995'' or nicknamed ''C95''.

Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte [[endianness]].\n\n===Compliance detectability===\nTo mitigate the differences between [[K&R C]] and the ANSI C standard, the <code>__STDC__</code> (\"standard c\") macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&R sections.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n #if defined(__STDC__) && __STDC__\n extern int getopt(int, char * const *, const char *);\n #else\n extern int getopt();\n #endif\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99. Note how this code checks both definition and evaluation: this is because some implementations may set <code>__STDC__</code> to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Compilers supporting ANSI C==\n* [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] (C K&R and C89/90)\n* [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] RealView\n* [[Clang]], using [[LLVM]] backend\n* [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (full C89/90, C99 and C11)\n* HP C/ANSI C compiler (C89 and C99)<ref>{{cite web|title=HP C/ANSI C developer's bundle|url=http://www.hp.com/go/c|accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref>\n* [[IBM XL C/C++]] (C11, starting with version 12.1)<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/support-iso-c11/index.html Support for ISO C11 added to IBM XL C/C++ compilers]</ref>\n* [[Intel C++ Compiler|Intel's ICC]]\n* [[LabWindows/CVI]]\n* [[LCC (compiler)|LCC]]\n* [[OpenWatcom]] (C89/90 and some C99)\n* [[Visual C++|Microsoft Visual C++]] (C89/90 and some C99)\n* [[Pelles C]] (C99 and C11.

On July 14, 1945, President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued Presidential Proclamation 2655, titled \u201cRemoval of Alien Enemies\u201d. The proclamation gave the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] authority regarding aliens enemies within the [[continental United States]], to decide whether they are \"dangerous to the public peace and safety of the United States\", to order them removed, and to create regulations governing their removal. The proclamation cited the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21\u201324) as to powers of the President to make public proclamation regarding \"subjects of the hostile nation\" more than fourteen years old and living inside the United States but not naturalized, to remove them as alien enemies, and to determine the means of removal.\n\nOn September 8, 1945, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2662, titled \"Removal of Alien Enemies\". The revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21\u201324) was cited as to removal of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety. The United States had agreed, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1942, to assume responsibility for the restraint and repatriation of dangerous alien enemies to be sent to the United States from Latin American republics. In another inter-American conference in Mexico City on March 8, 1945, North and South American governments resolved to recommended adoption of measures to prevent aliens of hostile nations who were deemed to be security threats or threats to welfare from remaining in North or South America. Truman gave authority to the Secretary of State to determine if alien enemies in the United States who were sent to the United States from Latin America, or who were in the United States illegally, endangered the welfare or security of the country. The Secretary of State was given power to remove them \"to destinations outside the limits of the Western Hemisphere\", to the former enemy territory of the governments to whose \"principles of which (the alien enemies) have adhered\". The Department of Justice was directed to assist the Secretary of State in their prompt removal.\n\nOn April 10, 1946, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2685, titled \u201cRemoval of Alien Enemies\u201d, citing the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21\u201324) as to its provision for the \u201cremoval from the United States of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety\u201d. Truman proclaimed regulations that were in addition to and supplemented other \"regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies\". As to alien enemies who had been brought into the [[continental United States]] from Latin America after December 1941, the proclamation gave the Secretary of State authority to decide if their presence was \"prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the Americas\", and to make regulations for their removal. 30 days was set as the reasonable time for them to \"effect the recovery, disposal, and removal of (their) goods and effects, and for (their) departure.\"\n\nIn 1947 New York's [[Ellis Island]] continued to incarcerate hundreds of ethnic Germans. Fort Lincoln was a large internment camp still holding internees in [[North Dakota]]. North Dakota was represented by controversial Senator [[William Langer|William \"Wild Bill\" Langer]]. Langer introduced a bill (S. 1749) \"for the relief of all persons detained as enemy aliens\", and directing the US Attorney General to cancel \"outstanding warrants of arrest, removal, or deportation\" for many German aliens still interned, listing many by name, and all of those detained by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), which was under the Department of Justice (DOJ). It directed the INS not to issue any more warrants or orders, if their only basis was the original warrants of arrest. The bill never passed. The Attorney General gave up [[plenary power|plenary]] jurisdiction over the last internee on Ellis Island late in 1948.\n\nIn Ludecke v. Watkins (1948), the Supreme Court interpreted the time of release under the Alien Enemies Act. German alien Kurt G. W. Ludecke was detained in 1941, under Proclamation 2526. and continued to be held after cessation of hostilities. In 1947, Ludecke petitioned for a [[writ of habeas corpus]] to order his release, after the Attorney General ordered him deported. The court ruled 5\u20134 to release Ludecke, but also found that the Alien Enemies Act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased, until an actual treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government.\n\nIn 1988, President Reagan and the 100th Congress introduced the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, whose purpose amongst others was to acknowledge and apologize for actions of the US against individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II.<ref>[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg903.pdf Civil Liberties Act of 1988, GPO Public Law 100-383, 1988]</ref> The statement from Congress agreed with the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, that \"a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese... without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\"\n\nIn 2015, presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] made a proposal to ban foreign [[Muslims]] from entering the United States (as part of the [[War on Terror]]); Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act was cited as a possible justification. The proposal created international controversy, drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in United States presidential elections.<ref name=DCCDT>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35037553|title=David Cameron criticises Donald Trump 'Muslim ban' call|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=PRMRT>{{cite news |title=Priebus, Ryan and McConnell Rip Trump Anti-Muslim Proposal |first1=Deirdre |last1=Walsh |first2=Jeremy |last2=Diamond |first3=Ted |last3=Barrett |work=CNN |date=December 8, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/paul-ryan-trump-comments-not-who-we-are-as-a-party/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the-world-reacts-to-trumps-proposed-ban-on-muslims-entering-us/2015/12/08/50eea1dc-9d4a-11e5-9ad2-568d814bbf3b_story.html|title=The world reacts to Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S.|author=Annie Gowen|date=December 8, 2015|work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Trump calls for 'shutdown' of Muslims entering US |first=Ben |last=Kamisar |work=The Hill |date=December 7, 2015 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/262348-trump-calls-for-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-us}}</ref> A former [[Reagan Administration]] aide noted that, despite criticism of Trump's proposal to invoke the law, \"the Alien Enemies Act... is still on the books...

A self-contradictory phrase such as \"There is no absolute truth\" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. A [[paradox]] such as \"[[this sentence is false]]\" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.\n\n==Kant's use==\n{{see|Kant's antinomies}}\nThe term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antinomy|volume=2|page=130}}</ref> [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.\n\nFor Kant there are [[Kant's antinomies|four antinomies]],<ref>S. Al-Azm, The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies, Oxford University Press 1972.</ref><ref>M. Grier, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, Cambridge University Press 2001.</ref><ref>M. Grier, \"The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies,\" in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.</ref> connected with:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy|title=antinomy {{!}} philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*the limitation of the universe in respect to [[space]] and [[time]]\n*the theory that the whole consists of indivisible [[atom]]s (whereas, in fact, none such exist)\n*the problem of [[free will]] in relation to universal [[causality]]\n*the existence of a universal being<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. For example: in the first antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by \"successive synthesis\"\u2014yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been \"empty time\" out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason: Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.\n\nThis was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]]). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Logic}}\n;Mutual incompatibility\n*Law:\n**[[Alternative pleading]]\n*Logic:\n**[[Mutual exclusivity]]\n**[[Kettle logic]]\n**[[Paradox]]\n*Religion:\n**[[Antinomianism]] (Christianity)\n*Others:\n**[[Oxymoron]]\n**[[Double bind]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* {{springer|title=Antinomy|id=p/a012710}}\n*{{PhilPapers|search|Antinomy}}\n\n{{Logic}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kantianism]]\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]", "sha1": "hv2vaj2k1t9qrpsqxg5zin5gdj68nvb"}}, {"title": "Anomalous phenomenon", "ns": "0", "id": "3180", "redirect": {"title": "Anomaly"}, "revision": {"id": "783858846", "parentid": "609977384", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:11:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Anomaly]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n{{R from long name}}\n}}", "sha1": "pzlbkakkj9d0xq05v5bpgfsrdssn3pb"}}, {"title": "Avengers", "ns": "0", "id": "3182", "redirect": {"title": "The Avengers"}, "revision": {"id": "783858870", "parentid": "546799072", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:11:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[The Avengers]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n{{R from short name}}\n}}", "sha1": "o6btyhqsb88lqoptsya35qy6k0vvqqj"}}, {"title": "Agglutinative", "ns": "0", "id": "3187", "redirect": {"title": "Agglutination"}, "revision": {"id": "783858881", "parentid": "179560712", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:11:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Agglutination]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from related word}}\n}}", "sha1": "1sj1oxoddpruzexk3bm6eq25je30j2r"}}, {"title": "Ascending chain condition", "ns": "0", "id": "3189", "revision": {"id": "853249598", "parentid": "853225314", "timestamp": "2018-08-03T12:18:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jochen Burghardt", "id": "17350134"}, "comment": "/* Comments */ fix typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In mathematics, the '''ascending chain condition''' ('''ACC''') and '''descending chain condition''' ('''DCC''') are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in certain [[commutative ring]]s.<ref>Hazewinkel, Gubareni & Kirichenko (2004), p.6, Prop. 1.1.4.</ref><ref>Fraleigh & Katz (1967), p. 366, Lemma 7.1</ref><ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 142 and 147</ref> These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of [[David Hilbert]], [[Emmy Noether]], and [[Emil Artin]].\nThe conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any [[partially ordered set]].

Following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-[[Hassidic]] community in the [[Negev|Negev desert]],<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> and, at the age of 23, became [[Israel]]'s youngest school principal.<ref name=tanya/>\n\nIn 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications, and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation into Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and a comprehensive commentary. Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (such as by [[Jacob Neusner]], 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States, and the world.{{citation needed|date= March 2015}} Over two million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. The out-of-print [[Random House]] publication of ''[[The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition]]'' is widely regarded as the most accurate and least redacted of any English language edition, and is sought after on that basis by scholars and collectors.{{citation needed|date= March 2015}} Controversial Talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in English translations like the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud, receive full exposition in the Steinsaltz Talmud. Random House halted publication of the Steinsaltz Talmud after less than one-third of the English translation had been published.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud have opened up the world of Talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught Talmud. Regarding the access that his work provides, Rabbi Steinsaltz says: \"I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings.\"\n\nRabbi Steinsaltz's classic work of [[Kabbalah]], ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'', was first published in 1980, and now appears in eight languages. In all, Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[sociology]], historical biography, and philosophy. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. His latest book is a memoir-biography on the [[Chabad|Lubavitcher]] [[Rebbe]], Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], published by Maggid Books (2014).\n\nIn the summer of 1989, a group of rabbis including [[Elazar Shach]] placed a ban on three of Steinsaltz's books.<ref>[http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article3071_19890804.asp Noach Zvuluny] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007200851/http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article3071_19890804.asp |date=7 October 2013 }}; Davar - 4/8/1989, p.3</ref>\n\nContinuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has served as scholar in residence at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington, D. C., and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from [[Yeshiva University]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Florida International University]]. Steinsaltz is also [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Hesder]] [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]].\n\nBeing a follower of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]], he went to help Jews in the [[Soviet Union]] assisting Chabad's ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' (propagators) network. Deeply involved in the future of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, Steinsaltz serves as the region's ''Duchovny Ravin'' (Spiritual Rabbi), a historic Russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union, he founded the Jewish University, both in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]]. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies in the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/hpeumr.htm |title=Jewish University in Moscow |website=Jewish-Heritage.org |publisher=Jewish Heritage Society |access-date=4 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927163427/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/hpeumr.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSteinsaltz has taken a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. During a visit of a delegation of Roman Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in Manhattan in January 2004, he said that, \"You do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting, as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough; however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable.

He also edited works by [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] (1905) and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] (1926).\n\nMany colleagues were unnerved by his scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship.<ref Name=\"Poets\" /> In his paper \"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\" (1921) Housman wrote: \"A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas.\" He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: \"Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head.\" <ref Name=\"PF\">[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/a-e-housman Poetry Foundation profile]</ref><ref>\"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism,\" (1921) Housman</ref>\n\n[[File:Housman Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|Housman's grave at St Laurence's Church in Ludlow. A cherry tree was planted in his memory (see ''A Shropshire Lad'' II), and replaced by the Housman Society in 2003 with a new cherry tree nearby]]\n\nHis younger colleague [[A. S. F. Gow]] quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they \"were often savage in the extreme\".<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 24</ref> Gow also related how Housman intimidated his students, sometimes reducing the women to tears. According to Gow, Housman (when teaching at University College London where, unlike Cambridge, he had students of both sexes) could never remember the names of his female students, maintaining that \"had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension\". One of Housman's notable pupils at Cambridge was [[Enoch Powell]].<ref>Gow (Cambridge 1936) p. 18</ref>\n\nIn his private life Housman enjoyed [[gastronomy]], flying in aeroplanes and making frequent visits to France, where he read \"books which were banned in Britain as pornographic\".<ref>Graves (1979) p155.</ref> But he struck [[A. C. Benson]], a fellow don, as being \"descended from a long line of maiden aunts\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Critchley (1988).</ref>\nHis feelings about his poetry were ambivalent and he certainly treated it as secondary to his scholarship. He did not speak in public about his poems until 1933, when he gave a lecture \"The Name and Nature of Poetry\", arguing there that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.\n\nHousman died, aged 77, in Cambridge. His ashes are buried just outside [[St Laurence's Church, Ludlow]], Shropshire.<ref Name=\"Poets\" /><ref>Wilson, Scott.

E. Housman completed ''A Shropshire Lad'', a cycle of 63 poems. After one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. Its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before [[World War I]], when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. The book has been in print continuously since May 1896.<ref>Peter Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p7dvBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Housman Country''], London 2016, Chapter 1</ref>\n\nThe poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation. Housman wrote many of them while living in [[Highgate]], London, before ever visiting Shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'.<ref>A. E. Housman, ''A Shropshire Lad'', XL</ref> Housman himself acknowledged that \"No doubt I have been unconsciously influenced by the Greeks and Latins, but [the] chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare's songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]].\"<ref>Richard Stokes, ''The Penguin Book of English Song'', 2016, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EoKmCgAAQBAJ&lpg=RA3-PR51&ots=J1yNAAGEap&dq=%22I%20was%20born%20in%20Worcestershire%2C%20not%20Shropshire%2C%20where%20I%20have%20never%20spent%20much%20time.%20%22&pg=RA3-PR51#v=onepage&q=%22I%20was%20born%20in%20Worcestershire,%20not%20Shropshire,%20where%20I%20have%20never%20spent%20much%20time.%20%22&f=false p.li]</ref>\n\n===Later collections===\nHousman began writing a new set of poems after the First World War. He was an influence on many British [[War Poets|poets]] who became famous by their writing about the war, and wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. This included his ''Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries'', honouring the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], an elite but small force of professional soldiers, 'a rapier amongst scythes'<ref>Liddell Harte, B. H. (1930). ''The Real War, 1914\u20131918'',&nbsp;p.42. Republished by Wildside Press, LLC, 2012. {{ISBN|978-1479412150}}</ref> sent to Belgium at the start of the war. Fighting a well-equipped and much larger German army, they suffered heavy losses.\n\nIn the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death.<ref Name =\"Poets\" /> These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in ''A Shropshire Lad'' but lack the consistency of his previously published work. He published them as ''[[Last Poems]]'' (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. After his death Housman's brother, [[Laurence Housman|Laurence]], published further poems in ''More Poems'' (1936), ''A. E .H.: Some Poems, Some Letters and a Personal Memoir by his Brother'' (1937), and ''Collected Poems'' (1939). ''A. E. H.'' includes humorous verse such as a parody of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow's]] poem [[Excelsior (Longfellow)|''Excelsior'']]. Housman also wrote a parodic ''Fragment of a Greek Tragedy'', in English, published posthumously with humorous poems under the title ''Unkind to Unicorns''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Unkind to Unicorns |publisher=Silent Books |location=Cambridge |year=1995 |editor=J. Roy Birch and Norman Page}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]] quoted a letter written late in Housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:\n{{Quote | Poetry was for him \u2026'a morbid secretion', as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with 'a little coaxing'; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head.  That... was a long and laborious process.<ref Name=\"Sparrow\" />}}\n\nSparrow himself adds, \"How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in ''A Shropshire Lad''. Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which.\"<ref Name=\"Sparrow\">''Collected Poems'' Penguin, Harmondsworth (1956), preface by John Sparrow.</ref>\n\n===''De Amicitia'' (Of Friendship)===\nIn 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled \"A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'\" (there is a link to the text, below in this article, under \"Further reading\") in the [[British Library]], with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housman's homosexuality and his love for Moses Jackson.<ref>Summers ed. 1995, 371.</ref> Despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, Housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in ''A Shropshire Lad'', about his deeper sympathies. Poem XXX of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how \"Fear contended with desire\": \"Others, I am not the first, / Have willed more mischief than they durst\". In ''More Poems'', he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave:<ref>Summers (1995) p372.</ref>\n\n<poem>\n::Because I liked you better\n::Than suits a man to say\n::It irked you, and I promised\n::To throw the thought away.\n\n::To put the world between us\n::We parted, stiff and dry;\n::Goodbye, said you, forget me.\n::I will, no fear, said I\n\n::If here, where clover whitens\n::The dead man's knoll, you pass,\n::And no tall flower to meet you\n::Starts in the trefoiled grass,\n\n::Halt by the headstone naming\n::The heart no longer stirred,\n::And say the lad that loved you\n::Was one that kept his word.<ref>A. E. Housman, ''More Poems,'' Jonathan Cape, London 1936 p.48</ref>\n</poem>\n\nHis poem \"Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?\", written after the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]], addressed more general attitudes towards homosexuals.<ref>Housman (1937) p213.</ref> In the poem the prisoner is suffering \"for the colour of his hair\", a natural quality that, in a coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as \"nameless and abominable\" (recalling the legal phrase ''peccatum illud horribile, inter Christianos non nominandum'', \"that horrible sin, not to be named amongst Christians\").\n\n==Housman song settings==\nHousman's poetry, especially ''A Shropshire Lad'', was set to music by many British, and in particular English, composers in the first half of the 20th century.<ref Name=\"PF\" /> The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in English music. In 1904 the cycle ''A Shropshire Lad'' was set by [[Arthur Somervell]], who had begun to develop the concept of the English [[song-cycle]] in his version of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Maud and other poems|Maud]]'' a little previously. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] produced his well-known settings of six songs, the cycle ''[[On Wenlock Edge (song cycle)|On Wenlock Edge]]'', for [[string quartet]], [[tenor]] and piano in 1909. Between 1909 and 1911 [[George Butterworth]] produced settings in two collections, ''[[Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad]]'' and ''[[Bredon Hill and Other Songs]]''. He also wrote the orchestral [[tone poem]] ''A Shropshire Lad'', first performed at [[Leeds]] Festival in 1912.<ref>[[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' Dent, London (1924), 73.</ref>\n\n[[Ivor Gurney]] was another composer who made renowned settings of Housman's poems. Towards the end of [[World War 1]] he was working on his cycle ''Ludlow and Teme'', for voice and string quartet (published in 1919),<ref>Kate Kennedy, \"Ambivalent Englishness: Ivor Gurney's song cycle Ludlow and Teme\", ''First World War Studies'',  Volume 2, 2011, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19475020.2011.555471?journalCode=rfww20 - Issue 1: Literature and Music of the First World War]</ref> and went on to compose the eight-song cycle ''The Western Playland'' in 1921.<ref>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/assemble_texts.html?SongCycleId=5 Lieder Net archive]</ref> One more  who set Housman songs at this period was [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] in the song cycle, ''[[The Land of Lost Content (John Ireland)|The Land of Lost Content]]'' (1920{{ndash}}21). Even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as [[Arnold Bax]], [[Lennox Berkeley]] and [[Arthur Bliss]], were attracted to Housman's poetry. A 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of Housman's poems.<ref>Palmer and Banfield 2001.</ref> As of 2016, Lieder Net Archive records 606 settings of 187 texts.<ref>LNA, [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_name_list.html?Type=Authors&Letter=H list of authors]</ref>\n\n==Commemorations==\nThe earliest commemoration of Housman was in the chapel of Trinity College in Cambridge, where there is a memorial brass on the south wall.<ref>[http://trinitycollegechapel.com/brasses-h-k  Trinity College chapel]</ref> The Latin inscription was composed by his colleague there, [[A.S.F. Gow]], who was also the author of a biographical and bibliographical sketch published immediately following his death.<ref>''A.E.Housman, Classical Scholar'', Bloomsbury 2009, N.

Following in [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]]'s footsteps he corrected the transmitted text of the Latin poets with so keen an intelligence and so ample a stock of learning, and chastised the sloth of editors so sharply and wittily, that he takes his place as the virtual second founder of textual studies.  He was also a poet whose slim volumes of verse assured him of a secure place on the British Helicon.  He died on 30th April 1936 at the age of seventy-six.<ref>In its original Latin the plaque reads: HOC TITVLO COMMEMORATVR / ALFRED EDWARD HOUSMAN [sic] / PER XXV ANNOS LINGVAE LATINAE PROFESSOR KENNEDIANVS / ET HVIVS COLLEGII SOCIVS / QVI BENTLEII INSISTENS VESTIGIIS / TEXTVM TRADITVM POETARVM LATINORVM / TANTO INGENII ACVMINE TANTIS DOCTRINAE COPIIS / EDITORVM SOCORDIAM / TAM ACRI CAVILLATIONE CASTIGAVIT / VT HORVM STVDIORVM PAENE REFORMATOR EXSTITERIT / IDEM POETA / TENVI CARMINVM FASCICVLO / SEDEM SIBI TVTAM IN HELICONE NOSTRO VINDICAVIT / OBIIT PRID.KAL.MAI./ A.S.MDCCCCXXXVI AETATIS SVAE LXXVII</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Refurbished A.

This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming \"signal\" that has gradually emerged from the \"noise\" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a \"[[smoking gun]].\" Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.<!-- Most of the preceding paragraph drawn from the following reference: --><ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 19.</ref>\n\nThe first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like [[tree ring]]s and [[coral]]s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier [[isotope]]s of [[oxygen]] in [[ice core]]s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).<!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a [[current sea level rise|rise]] in global sea level, retreat of [[sea ice]] and [[snow]] cover, cooling of the [[stratosphere]], an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure patterns]]. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.<!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====\"Fingerprint\" studies====\n[[File:Attribution of global warming \u2013 simulation of 20th century global mean temperatures (with and without human influences) compared to observations (NASA).png|thumb |right |alt=Refer to caption |Reconstructions of global temperature that include greenhouse gas increases and other human influences (red line, based on many models) closely match measured temperatures (dashed line).<ref name=\"lindsey 20th century gmt simulations\">\nQuote from public-domain source: {{citation\n | author=Lindsey, R.\n | date=4 May 2010\n | title=If Earth has warmed and cooled throughout history, what makes scientists think that humans are causing global warming now? : Climate Q&A : Blogs\n | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/climateqa/if-earth-has-warmed-and-cooled-throughout-history-what-makes-scientists-think-that-humans-are-causing-global-warming-now/\n | publisher=Earth Observatory, part of the EOS Project Science Office, located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n}}\n</ref> Those that only include natural influences (blue line, based on many models) show a slight cooling, which has not occurred.<ref name=\"lindsey 20th century gmt simulations\"/> The ability of models to generate reasonable histories of global temperature is verified by their response to four 20th-century volcanic eruptions: each eruption caused brief cooling that appeared in observed as well as modeled records.<ref name=\"lindsey 20th century gmt simulations\"/>]]\n\nFinally, there is extensive [[statistical]] evidence from so-called \"fingerprint\" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=220\n|image1=GISS temperature 2000-09 lrg.png\n|alt1=refer to caption\n|image2=GISS temperature palette.svg\n|alt2=key to above map of temperature changes\n|caption2=Two fingerprints of human activities on the climate are that land areas will warm more than the oceans, and that high latitudes will warm more than low latitudes.<ref name=\"schneider fingerprint\">\n{{citation\n | author=Schneider, S.\n | title=Climate Science\n | url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/Science.html#topofpage\n | at=[http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/Science.html#Itislikelythathumanactivitieshavecausedadiscernibleimpactonobservedwarmingtrends It is likely that human activities have caused a discernible impact on observed warming trends]\n | publisher=[[Stephen H.

When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Solar activity|solar activity]]). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]], which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, [[drought]], surface pressure, and the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from major [[river basin]]s.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":1\">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 20.</ref>\n\nStudies published after the appearance of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric [[moisture]] (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of [[Arctic sea ice]] extent, and in the patterns of changes in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] surface temperatures.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence \u2013 the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":2\">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 21.</ref>\n\nIncreasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in [[snowpack]], maximum and minimum ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over [[mountain]]ous regions of the [[western United States]]. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in [[hurricane]] formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the [[tropics]], all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the [[satellite]] and [[weather balloon]] data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:Effect of various natural and human factors on global mean temperature between 1889-2006 (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=Refer to caption|This set of graphs shows the estimated contribution of various natural and human factors to changes in global mean temperature between 1889\u20132006.<ref>{{citation\n |author1=Lean, J.

The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref>{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 22.</ref>\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Shifting Distribution of Summer Temperature Anomalies2.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Frequency of occurrence (vertical axis) of local June\u2013July\u2013August temperature anomalies (relative to 1951\u20131980 mean) for Northern Hemisphere land in units of local [[standard deviation]] (horizontal axis).<ref name=\"climate dice\">\n{{citation\n | pages=3\u20134\n | author=Hansen, J.\n | date=July 2012\n | title=The New Climate Dice: Public Perception of Climate Change\n | publisher=Dr James E.

(2009):<ref>\n{{harvnb|Duplissy|others|2009}}\n</ref><blockquote>The CLOUD experiments at [[CERN]] are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Global warming|Energy}}\n* [[Climate change adaptation]]\n* [[Climate change denial]]\n* [[Climate change mitigation]]\n* [[Climate resilience]]\n* [[Environmental impact of aviation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}} {{refbegin|}}\n*{{citation\n | ref=CITEREFCarslaw2009\n | author=Carslaw, K.\n | date=16 July 2009\n | title= Atmospheric physics: Cosmic rays, clouds, and climate\n | journal=Nature\n | volume=460\n | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7253/full/460332a.html\n | doi= 10.1038/460332a\n|bibcode = 2009Natur.460..332C\n | issue=7253\n | pages=332\u2013333}}, pp.&nbsp;332\u2013333.

For example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future.\n\nOne simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where <math>p^e</math> is the next year's [[expected inflation|rate of inflation that is currently expected]]; <math>p^e_{-1}</math>is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and <math>p</math> is this year's actual rate of inflation:\n\n::<math>p^e = p^{e}_{-1} + \\lambda (p - p^{e}_{-1})</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lambda</math> is between 0 and 1. This says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an \"error-adjustment\" term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations.  This error-adjustment is also called \"''partial adjustment''.\"\n\nThe theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal:\n\n::<math>p^e = \\lambda \\sum_{j = 0}^{\\infty} ((1-\\lambda)^j p_j)</math>\n\nwhere <math>p_j</math> equals actual inflation <math>j</math> years in the past. Thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past.\n\nOnce a forecasting error is made by agents, due to a stochastic shock, they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors. The backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents (see [[Cobweb model]]) was unsatisfactory to economists such as [[John Muth]], who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed, called [[rational expectations]]. This has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory. However, it must be stressed that confronting adaptivity and rationality is not necessarily justified, in other words, there are situations in which following the adaptive scheme is a rational response.\n\nAdaptive expectations were instrumental in the [[Phillips curve]] outlined by [[Milton Friedman]]. For Friedman, workers form adaptive expectations, so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. As agents are trapped by the [[money illusion]], they are unable to correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for Friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. The result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate for an extended period of time. However, in this framework it is clear why and how adaptive expectations are problematic. Agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. For example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. This is the reason why the theory of adaptive expectations is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Galb\u00e1cs |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

Possible explanations include:\n*Not developing eyes allows the individual more energy for growth and reproduction. However the species does use other methods to locate food and detect danger, which also consume energy that would be conserved if it had eyes or transparent eyelids.\n*There remains less chance of accidental damage and infection, since the previously useless and exposed organ is sealed with a flap of protective skin. It is unknown why this species did not develop transparent skin or eyelids instead, as some species of reptiles did.\n*The lack of eyes disables the \"body clock\", which is controlled by periods of light and dark, conserving energy. However sunlight does have minimal impact on the \"body clock\" in caves.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nAnother likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of selective neutrality and genetic drift; in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. Because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population.\n\nAmong some [[creation-evolution controversy|creationists]], the cave tetra is seen as evidence 'against' evolution. One argument claims this is an instance of \"[[Biological devolution|devolution]]\"\u2014showing an evolutionary trend of decreasing complexity. But evolution is a non-directional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.<ref>Dawkins, R.: Climbing Mount Improbable, W.

Furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. Rather, the sample is evaporated in a controlled manner (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which is typically 10 to 100&nbsp;cm away.\n\nThe samples are required to have a needle geometry and are produced by similar techniques as TEM sample preparation [[electropolishing]], or [[focused ion beam]] methods.  Since 2006, commercial systems with laser pulsing have become available and this has expanded applications from metallic only specimens into semiconducting, insulating such as ceramics, and even geological materials.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=John W.|last1=Valley|first2=David A.|last2=Reinhard|first3=Aaron J.|last3=Cavosie|first4=Takayuki|last4=Ushikubo|title=Nano- and micro-geochronology in Hadean and Archean zircons by atom-probe tomography and SIMS: New tools for old minerals|url=http://ammin.geoscienceworld.org/content/gsammin/100/7/1355.full.pdf|journal=American Mineralogist|date=2015-07-01|issn=0003-004X|pages=1355\u20131377|volume=100|issue=7|doi=10.2138/am-2015-5134|first5=Daniel F.|last5=Lawrence|first6=David J.|last6=Larson|first7=Thomas F.|last7=Kelly|first8=David R.|last8=Snoeyenbos|first9=Ariel|last9=Strickland|bibcode=2015AmMin.100.1355V}}</ref>\nPreparation is done, often by hand, to manufacture a tip radius sufficient to induce a high electric field, with radii on the order of 100&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]].\n\nTo conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped specimen is placed in an [[ultra high vacuum]] chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100&nbsp;K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2&nbsp;kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time.  Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.\n\nWhilst the uncertainty in the atomic mass computed by time-of-flight methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. Effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Field ion microscopy ===\n{{main|Field ion microscopy}}\nField ion microscopy is a modification of [[field emission microscopy]] where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp needle-like ''tip'' cathode when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6&nbsp;V/nm).<ref name=\"Gomer\">{{cite book|title=Field emission and field ionization|author=Gomer, R|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1961|isbn=1-56396-124-5}}</ref> The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the [[work function]] at the tip apex.

Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by [[Oxford Instruments|Oxford Nanoscience]] and [[CAMECA]] respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument.  The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments.

Once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.\n\n=== Ion flight ===\n\nWhether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nSubsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the [[electrostatic equation]], where ''n'' is the ionisation state of the ion, and ''e'' is the fundamental electric charge.\n\n:<math>F=ne \\nabla \\phi</math>\n\nThis can be equated with the mass of the ion, ''m'', via Newton's law (F=ma):\n\n:<math> ma = q \\nabla \\phi</math>\n\n:<math> a = \\frac{q}{m} \\nabla \\phi</math>\n\nRelativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.\n\nAssuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity. As the ion will travel from the tip at voltage V<sub>1</sub> to some nominal ground potential, the speed at which the ion is travelling can be estimated by the energy transferred into the ion during (or near) ionisation. Therefore, the ion speed can be computed with the following equation, which relates kinetic energy to energy gain due to the electric field, the negative arising from the loss of electrons forming a net positive charge.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2}mU_{\\mathrm{ion}}^2 = -neV_1</math>\n\nWhere ''U'' is the ion velocity. Solving for ''U'', the following relation is found:\n\n:<math> U =\\sqrt{ \\frac{ 2neV_1}{m}}</math>\n\nLet's say that for at a certain ionization voltage, a singly charged [[hydrogen]] ion acquires a resulting velocity of X&nbsp;ms<sup>\u22121</sup>. A singly charged [[deuterium]] ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41&nbsp;ms<sup>\u22121</sup>. If a detector was placed at a distance of 1&nbsp;m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/X&nbsp;s. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.\n\nFrom the above equation, it can be re-arranged to show that\n\n:<math> \\frac{m}{n} = -\\frac{2eV_1}{U^2} </math>\n\ngiven a known flight distance. F, for the ion, and a known flight time, t,\n\n:<math> U = \\frac{f}{t}</math>\n\nand thus one can substitute these values to obtain the mass-to-charge for the ion.\n\n:<math> \\frac{m}{n} = -2eV_1 \\left(\\frac{t}{f}\\right)^2 </math>\n\nThus for an ion which traverses a 1&nbsp;m flight path, across a time of 2000&nbsp;ns, given an initial accelerating voltage of 5000&nbsp;V (V in Si units is kg.m^2.s^-3.A^-1) and noting that one amu is 1\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup>&nbsp;kg, the mass-to-charge ratio (more correctly the mass-to-ionisation value ratio) becomes ~3.86 amu/charge. The number of electrons removed, and thus net positive charge on the ion is not known directly, but can be inferred from the histogram (spectrum) of observed ions.\n\n=== Magnification ===\nThe magnification in an atom is due to the projection of ions radially away from the small, sharp tip. Subsequently, in the far field, the ions will be greatly magnified. This magnification is sufficient to observe field variations due to individual atoms, thus allowing in field ion and field evaporation modes for the imaging of single atoms.\n\nThe standard projection model for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a [[conic section]], such as a sphere, [[hyperboloid]] or [[paraboloid]]. For these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained analytically. The magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.\n\n:<math>M = \\frac{r_{screen}}{r_{tip}}. </math>\n\nWhere r<sub>screen</sub> is the radius of the detection screen from the tip centre, and r<sub>tip</sub> the tip radius. Practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same [[field of view]].\n\nPractically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.\n\nWhilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependent upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional [[electron microscope]]s, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nThe computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position sensitive detector, to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed \"reconstruction\". Reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. Most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and use empirical corrections to [[stereographic projection]] to convert detector positions back to a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, R<sup>3</sup>. By sweeping this surface through R<sup>3</sup> as a function of the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2D detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.\n\nTypically the sweep takes the simple form of an advancement of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton [[shuttlecock]]. The detected events thus become a [[point cloud]] data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.\n\nThis form of data manipulation allows for rapid computer visualisation and analysis, with data presented as point cloud data with additional information, such as each ion's mass to charge (as computed from the velocity equation above), voltage or other auxiliary measured quantity or computation therefrom.\n\n=== Data features ===\n\nThe canonical feature of atom probe data, is its high spatial resolution in the direction through the material, which has been attributed to an ordered evaporation sequence. This data can therefore image near atomically sharp buried interfaces with the associated chemical information.\n\nThe data obtained from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.\n\nThe resultant deflection means that in these regions of high curvature, atomic terraces are belied by a strong anisotropy in the detection density. Where this occurs due to a few atoms on a surface is usually referred to as a \"pole\", as these are coincident with the crystallographic axes of the specimen ([[Cubic crystal system|FCC]], [[Cubic crystal system|BCC]], [[Close-packing of spheres|HCP]]) etc.  Where the edges of an atomic terrace causes deflection, a low density line is formed and is termed a \"zone line\".\n\nThese poles and zone-lines, whilst inducing fluctuations in data density in the reconstructed datasets, which can prove problematic during post-analysis, are critical for determining information such as angular magnification, as the crystallographic relationships between features are typically well known.\n\nWhen reconstructing the data, owing to the evaporation of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly anisotropic. Determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as the resolution of the device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.\n\n== Systems ==\nMany designs have been constructed since the method's inception. Initial field ion microscopes, precursors to modern atom probes, were usually glass blown devices developed by individual research laboratories.\n\n=== System layout ===\nAt a minimum, an atom probe will consist of several key pieces of equipment.\n\n* A vacuum system for maintaining the low pressures (~10<sup>\u22128</sup> to 10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;Pa) required, typically a classic 3 chambered UHV design.\n* A system for manipulation of samples inside the vacuum, including sample viewing systems.  \n* A cooling system to reduce atomic motion, such as a helium refrigeration circuit - providing sample temperatures as low as 15K.\n* A high voltage system to raise the sample standing voltage near the threshold for field evaporation.\n* A high voltage pulsing system, use to create timed field evaporation events\n* A counter electrode that can be a simple disk shape (like the EIKOS\u2122, or earlier generation atom probes), or a cone shaped Local Electrode, like on a LEAP\u00ae system.  The voltage pulse (negative) is typically applied to the counter electrode.  \n* A detection system for single energetic ions that includes XY position and TOF information.\n\nOptionally, an atom probe may also include laser-optical systems for laser beam targeting and pulsing, if using laser-evaporation methods. In-situ reaction systems, heaters, or plasma treatment may also be employed for some studies as well as pure noble gas introduction for FIM.\n\n=== Performance ===\n\nCollectable ion volumes were previously limited to several thousand, or tens of thousands of ionic events. Subsequent electronics and instrumentation development has increased the rate of data accumulation, with datasets of hundreds of million atoms (dataset volumes of 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;nm<sup>3</sup>).  Data collection times vary considerably depending upon the experimental conditions and the number of ions collected.  Experiments take from a few minutes, to many hours to complete.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Metallurgy ===\nAtom probe has typically been employed in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. This has arisen as a result of voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. Metal samples from large grained alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.\n\nSubsequently, atom probe has been used in the analysis of the chemical composition of a wide range of alloys.\n\nSuch data is critical in determining the effect of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.\n\n=== Semiconductors ===\nSemi-conductor materials are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation may be more difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, particularly if the semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.\n\nApplications such as ion implantation may be used to identify the distribution of dopants inside a semi-conducting material, which is increasingly critical in the correct design of modern nanometre scale electronics.\n\n==  Limitations ==\n\n* Materials implicitly control achievable spatial resolution.\n* Specimen geometry during the analysis is uncontrolled, yet controls projection behaviour, hence there is little control over the magnification. This induces distortions into the computer generated 3D dataset. Features of interest might evaporate in a physically different manner to the bulk sample, altering projection geometry and the magnification of the reconstructed volume. This yields strong spatial distortions in the final image.\n* Volume selectability can be limited. Site specific preparation methods, e.g. using [[Focussed ion beam]] preparation, although more time consuming, may be used to bypass such limitations.\n* Ion overlap in some samples (e.g. between oxygen and sulfur) resulted in ambiguous analysed species. This may be mitigated by selection of experiment temperature or laser input energy to influence the ionisation number (+, ++, 3+ etc.) of the ionised groups. Data analysis can be used in some cases to statistically recover ovelaps.\n* Low molecular weight gases ([[Hydrogen]] & [[Helium]]) may be difficult to be removed from the analysis chamber, and may be adsorbed and emitted from the specimen, even though not present in the original specimen. This may also limit identification of Hydrogen in some samples. For this reason, [[deuterated]] samples have been used to overcome limitations.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n* Results may be contingent on the parameters used to convert the 2D detected data into 3D. In more problematic materials, correct reconstruction may not be done, due to limited knowledge of the true magnification; particularly if zone or pole regions cannot be observed.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael K.

His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33.\n\nCapone was born in New York City, to [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]]. He was a [[Five Points Gang]] member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for [[Johnny Torrio]], head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol\u2014the forerunner of the Outfit\u2014and was politically protected through the [[Unione Siciliana]]. A conflict with the [[North Side Gang]] was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone. Capone expanded the [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] and the city's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement.\n\nCapone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as \"modern-day [[Robin Hood]]\". However, the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]], in which seven gang rivals were murdered in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's and Capone's image, leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub Capone \"Public Enemy No. 1\".\n\nThe federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone and prosecuted him in 1931 for [[tax evasion]], which was at that time a federal crime; the prosecution was a novel strategy. During a highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence Capone's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government taxes he owed. He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]]. After conviction, he replaced his defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed. Capone showed signs of [[Neurosyphilis|syphilitic]] [[dementia]] early in his sentence and became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years of incarceration. On January 25, 1947, Capone died of [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a stroke.<ref name=\"cstdivill\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14735502/al_capone_dies/ |work=Chicago Sunday Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Al Capone dies in Florida villa |date=January 26, 1947 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|Alphonse Gabriel \"Al\" Capone with his mother, Teresa]]\n\nAl Capone was born in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of New York City on January 17, 1899.<ref name=\"CAPONE\"/> His parents were [[Italian Americans|Italian]] immigrants Gabriele Capone (1865\u20131920) and Teresa Capone (n\u00e9e Raiola; 1867\u20131952).

Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the [[Chicago Outfit]] for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.\n\nThe Capone family immigrated to the United States, after first moving to nearby [[Fiume]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1893. From that port city they traveled on a ship to the U.S., where they settled at 95 Navy Street, in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] section of [[downtown Brooklyn]]. Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue.

Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years.

Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} Capone was officially diagnosed with [[syphilis]] and [[Gonorrhea|gonorrhoea]]. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his septum.

Far from being smashed, the [[Chicago Outfit]] continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead \"front boss\".<ref name=\"articles.chicagotribune.com\"/> Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.<ref>''The Chicago Outfit'', John J.

Hopkins refused to admit him based solely on his reputation, but [[Union Memorial Hospital]] accepted him. Capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939.

[[Figures of merit]] can be given as a list of [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] that include properties such as [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Nonlinear system|linearity]], among others listed in this article. Figures of merit are important for determining the suitability of a particular amplifier for an intended use.\n\n== Gain ==\nThe [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of an amplifier is the ratio of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in [[decibel]]s. When measured in decibels it is [[logarithm]]ically related to the power ratio: ''G''(dB)=10 log(''P<sub>out</sub>'' /''P<sub>in</sub>''). [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers are often specified in terms of the maximum ''power gain'' obtainable, while the [[voltage]] gain of audio amplifiers and [[instrumentation amplifier]]s will be more often specified. For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20&nbsp;dB will have a ''voltage gain'' of ten.\n\nThe use of voltage gain figure is appropriate when the amplifier's [[input impedance]] is much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance.\n\nIf two equivalent amplifiers are being compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings would be more sensitive as it would take less input signal to produce a given amount of power.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcae1.com/gaincon2.htm |title=Amplifier Gain Controls |access-date=2017-11-11}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Bandwidth ==\nThe [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of an amplifier is the range of frequencies for which the amplifier gives \"satisfactory performance\". The definition of \"satisfactory performance\" may be different for different applications. However, a common and well-accepted metric is the [[half-power point]]s (i.e. frequency where the power goes down by half its peak value) on the output vs. frequency curve. Therefore, bandwidth can be defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. This is therefore also known as the {{nowrap|\u22123 dB}} bandwidth. Bandwidths (otherwise called \"frequency responses\") for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted ({{nowrap|\u22121 dB}}, {{nowrap|\u22126 dB}} etc.) or \"plus or minus 1dB\" (roughly the sound level difference people usually can detect).\n\nThe gain of a good quality full-range audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20&nbsp;Hz to about 20&nbsp;kHz (the range of normal human [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more [[Octave (electronics)|octaves]] either side) and might have {{nowrap|\u22123 dB}} points < 10&nbsp;Hz and > {{nowrap|65&nbsp;kHz}}. Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{nowrap|20&nbsp;Hz-20&nbsp;kHz}}; too much of the amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on [[infrasonic]] and [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies, and the danger of AM [[radio interference]] would increase. Modern [[switching amplifier]]s need steep [[Low-pass filter|low pass filtering]] at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and [[harmonic]]s.\n\nThe range of frequency over which the gain is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its maximum gain is termed as bandwidth.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8fmUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=The+range+of+frequency+over+which+the+gain+is+equal+to+or+greater+than+70.7%25+of+its+maximum+gain+is+termed+as+bandwidth.&source=bl&ots=UiyAJfkHux&sig=axRzYlWGT-a1KtC4wwq3nuga7rI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBnJ3YirnYAhVLPI8KHW4sBhAQ6AEIMzAB#v=onepage&q=The%20range%20of%20frequency%20over%20which%20the%20gain%20is%20equal%20to%20or%20greater%20than%2070.7%25%20of%20its%20maximum%20gain%20is%20termed%20as%20bandwidth.&f=false|title=PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRONICS|last=KUMAR|first=GANGULY, PARTHA|date=2015-09-16|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120351240|language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n== Efficiency ==\nEfficiency is a measure of how much of the power source is usefully applied to the amplifier's output. [[Electronic amplifier#Power amplifier classes|Class A]] amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10\u201320% with a max efficiency of 25% for [[direct coupling]] of the output. [[Inductive coupling]] of the output can raise their efficiency to a maximum of 50%.\n\nDrain efficiency is the ratio of output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a [[field-effect transistor]]. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding.  In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both above and below the rail during operation.  While the voltage level is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.\n\nClass B amplifiers have a very high efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: [[Crossover distortion]]). In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30\u201355% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.\n\nCommercially available Class D [[switching amplifier]]s have reported efficiencies as high as 90%. Amplifiers of Class C-F are usually known to be very high-efficiency amplifiers. RCA manufactured an AM broadcast transmitter employing a single class-C low-mu triode with an RF efficiency in the 90% range.\n\nMore efficient amplifiers run cooler, and often do not need any cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. The reason for this is that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.\n\nIn RF linear Power Amplifiers, such as cellular base stations and broadcast transmitters, special design techniques can be used to improve efficiency.  Doherty designs, which use a second output stage as a \"peak\" amplifier, can lift efficiency from the typical 15% up to 30-35% in a narrow bandwidth.  Envelope Tracking designs are able to achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, by modulating the supply voltage to the amplifier in line with the envelope of the signal.\n\n== Linearity{{anchor|linearity}} ==\nAn ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits.\n\nWhen the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in [[distortion]].\n\nIn most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a ''compression'' effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1&nbsp;dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1&nbsp;dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.\n\nIll effects of non-linearity can be reduced with negative feedback.\n\n[[Linearization]] is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]], [[predistortion]], postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.\n\n== Noise ==\nThis is a measure of how much [[noise]] is introduced in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is [[noise figure]] or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.\n\n== Output dynamic range ==\nOutput [[dynamic range]] is the range, usually given in dB, between the smallest and largest useful output levels. The lowest useful level is limited by output [[noise]], while the largest is limited most often by distortion. The ratio of these two is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range. More precisely, if ''S'' = maximal allowed signal power and ''N'' = noise power, the dynamic range ''DR'' is ''DR = (S + N ) /N''.<ref name=Verhoeven>\n{{cite book\n|vauthors =((Verhoeven CJM)), van Staveren A, ((Monna GLE)), ((Kouwenhoven MHL)), Yildiz E\n|last-author-amp =yes\n|title=Structured electronic design: negative feedback amplifiers\n|year= 2003\n|pages=10\n|publisher=Kluwer Academic\n|location=Boston/Dordrecht\n|isbn= 1-4020-7590-1\n|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/1-4020-7590-1}}\n</ref>\n\nIn many switched mode amplifiers, dynamic range is limited by the minimum output step size.\n\n== Slew rate ==\n[[Slew rate]] is the maximum rate of change of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many amplifiers are ultimately [[slew rate]] limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full [[power bandwidth]] to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.\n\n== Rise time ==\nThe [[rise time]], t<sub>r</sub>, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a [[step response|step input]].\nFor a [[Gaussian]] response system (or a simple RC [[roll-off|roll off]]), the rise time is approximated by:\n\n'''t<sub>r</sub> * BW = 0.35''', where t<sub>r</sub> is rise time in [[second]]s and BW is bandwidth in [[hertz|Hz]].\n\n== Settling time and ringing ==\nThe time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the [[settling time]], and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high-accuracy measurement systems. [[Ringing (signal)|Ringing]] refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output.  Ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an [[Damping#Under-damping (0 \u2264 \u03b6 < 1)|underdamped]] circuit.\n\n== Overshoot ==\nIn response to a step input, the [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] is the amount the output exceeds its final, steady-state value.\n\n== Stability ==\nStability is an issue in all amplifiers with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. It is especially an issue when applied over multiple amplifying stages.\n\n[[BIBO stability|Stability]] is a major concern in [[Radio frequency|RF]] and [[microwave]] amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability can be quantified by a so-called stability factor. There are several different stability factors, such as the Stern stability factor and the Linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier in terms of its [[two-port parameters]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Audio system measurements]]\n*[[Low-noise amplifier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/efficiency.cfm Efficiency of Microwave Devices]\n*[http://www.ztecinstruments.com/zconnect/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/PA_802.11ac_APP_NOTE.pdf RF Power Amplifier Testing]\n\n[[Category:Amplifiers]]", "sha1": "m168b7b1grdgleu2abolnkc2pd39l3e"}}, {"title": "Astable", "ns": "0", "id": "3215", "redirect": {"title": "Multivibrator"}, "revision": {"id": "783858933", "parentid": "179561870", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:12:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Multivibrator]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R with possibilities}}\n}}", "sha1": "b654oc1b8rze6x6n6hwopiv221odzge"}}, {"title": "Army of Darkness", "ns": "0", "id": "3217", "revision": {"id": "866607940", "parentid": "866382422", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T11:48:48Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cydebot", "id": "1215485"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot - Moving category Time travel films\u200e  to [[:Category:Films about time travel]] per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 October 23]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the wrestling stable|Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Army of Darkness\n| image          = Army of Darkness poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Sam Raimi]]\n| producer       = [[Robert Tapert]]\n| writer         = {{ubl|Sam Raimi|[[Ivan Raimi]]}}\n| starring       = {{ubl|[[Bruce Campbell]]|[[Embeth Davidtz]]}}\n| music          = [[Joseph LoDuca]]\n| cinematography = [[Bill Pope]]\n| editing        = {{ubl|[[Bob Murawski]]|R.O.C.

It stars Campbell and [[Embeth Davidtz]]. It is the third installment in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise, and continuing from ''[[Evil Dead II]],'' [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is trapped in the [[Middle Ages]] and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.\n\nThe film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Studios]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]] were responsible for the Ash & Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |title=Book Of The Dead - The Definitive Evil Dead Website |publisher=Bookofthedead.ws |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Army of Darkness'' premiered at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to [[Irvin Shapiro]], who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter being transported to the Middle Ages, [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.\n\nAccording to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. \n\nWhen he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely{{snd}} \"[[Klaatu barada nikto]]\"{{snd}} he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough \"nikto\". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.\n\nUpon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.\n\nBack in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a [[Winchester rifle]] from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims \"hail to the king, baby\" before passionately kissing the woman. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/army-of-darkness-bubba-ho-top-comic-ash-elvis-evil-dead/|title=Ash Vs.

As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.<ref name=\"Muir6\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|title=10 Canceled Twists That Would\u2019ve Saved Movies (And 10 That Would\u2019ve Hurt Them)|author=Leon Miller|date=July 30, 2018|work=ScreenRant|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2018/08/21/bruce-campbell-ash-vs-evil-dead-3-sam-raimi-rob-tapert-lucy-lawless-starz/|title=Bruce Campbell Talks 'Ash Vs.

''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], \"was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made\".<ref name=\"Warren\">{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Warren (film historian and critic) | title = The Evil Dead Companion | work = | page = 143 | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2000 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.  The working title for the project was ''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.<ref name=\"Warren2\">Warren 2000, p. 107.</ref>  The title \"Army of Darkness\" came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.<ref>Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.</ref>\n\n===Screenplay and pre-production===\nInitially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.<ref name=\"Warren3\">Warren 2000, p. 140.</ref> After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] decided to co-write the film together.<ref name=\"Warren4\">Warren 2000, p. 142.</ref> They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.<ref name=\"Muir\"/> After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan \"has a good sense of character\" and that he brought more comedy into the script.<ref name=\"Warren4\"/> Campbell remembers, \"We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting\".<ref name=\"Warren\"/> Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.<ref name=\"Warren6\">Warren 2000, p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.<ref name=\"Muir\"/> ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.<ref name=\"Warren5\">Warren 2000, p. 144.</ref> However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Robert Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.<ref name=\"Muir\"/> Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming]]'s film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.<ref name=\"Muir2\"/> A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.<ref name=\"Muir2\"/>\n\n[[Traci Lords]] was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, \"I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell],\" with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | title=Traci Lords |publisher= (chat transcript), [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] | date = January 25, 2001 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030729085136/http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | archivedate=July 29, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[Front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].<ref name=\"Muir2\">Muir 2004, p. 153.</ref> Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.<ref name=\"Muir2\"/> According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was \"the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character\".<ref name=\"Robley\">{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | authorlink =  | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via \"Go-Animation\" |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |page = 74 | language = | publisher = | date = March 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nShooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.<ref name=\"Warren9\">Warren 2000, p. 147.</ref> It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.<ref name=\"Muir3\">Muir 2004, p. 155.</ref> Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.<ref name=\"Warren7\">Warren 2000, p. 151.</ref> Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.<ref name=\"Muir4\">Muir 2004, p. 156.</ref>\n\nIt was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.<ref name=\"Muir5\">Muir 2004, p. 157.</ref> Mesa remembers, \"Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes\".<ref name=\"Muir5\"/> Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons{{clarify|date=January 2012}} that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.<ref name=\"Muir5\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nWhile [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.<ref name=\"Muir6\">Muir 2004, p. 159.</ref> Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.<ref name=\"Muir6\"/> In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]].<ref name=\"Muir6\"/> Raimi recalls, \"Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero\".<ref name=\"Warren11\">Warren 2000, p. 156.</ref>\n\nRaimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character which Universal needed so that they could film a [[Hannibal (film)|sequel]] to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name=\"Muir8\">Muir 2004, p. 162.</ref> The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for ''Army of Darkness''' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.\n\nFor the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.<ref name=\"Warren12\">Warren 2000, p. 158.</ref> Raimi ran into further troubles when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.<ref name=\"Warren8\"/> In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.<ref name=\"Warren8\"/>\n\n===Music===\n[[Danny Elfman]], who composed the score for ''Darkman'', wrote the \"March of the Dead\" theme for ''Army of Darkness''.<ref name=\"Warren8\">Warren 2000, p. 153.</ref> After the re-shoots were completed, [[Joseph LoDuca]], who composed the music for ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', returned to score the film.<ref name=\"Muir7\">Muir 2004, p. 160.</ref>  The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the [[Seattle Symphony]].<ref name=\"Warren8\"/> The score was released during the [[MondoCon]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on October 3 and 4, 2015, on [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]], over [[Mondo Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3356356/mondo-announces-army-darkness-vinyl-soundtrack/ |title=Mondo Announces \u2018Army Of Darkness\u2019 Vinyl Soundtrack |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Army of Darkness (1992 Film).jpg|thumb|Theatrical international release poster by [[Renato Casaro]]]]\n===Box office===\n''Army of Darkness'' was released by Universal on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend.

In addition, the goal was to take advantage of modern sonars with a much larger detection range. An extended range torpedo delivered by parachute from the air would allow warships the stand-off capability to attack hostile submarines with very little advance notice to the hostile submarine. The RAT program came in three phases:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5d0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=rocket+assisted+torpedo&source=bl&ots=IxAcbiK5G9&sig=sVL0o_Sv_k-WB8CalZCpLuBvv78&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R-TqTrbYDtK-gAf8o82YCQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=rocket%20assisted%20torpedo&f=true \"Navy Homing Torpedoes Fights Subs.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1958, p. 108.</ref>  RAT-A, RAT-B and RAT-C. RAT-A (and its follow-on, RAT-B) were efforts to develop a compact and economical stand-off ASW for smaller warships, but were found to be either unreliable or had too short a range. RAT-C was a program to develop a stand-off ASW weapon that used a nuclear depth charge. This would require a range of at least 8,000 yards to escape potential damage from the underwater blast. Unlike the original RAT program rockets, the RAT-C was considerably larger to accomplish the extended range needed and was to be fitted to larger warships. With the failure of both the RAT-A and RAT-B programs, RAT-C was redesigned from a stand-off nuclear ASW weapon to one that could use not only a nuclear depth charge but also a homing ASW torpedo. To obtain the accuracy needed, the RAT-C rocket launcher had to be redesigned with larger side fins. This program finally combined reliability and accuracy, along with the necessary stand-off range. However, before RAT-C reached initial operational status in 1960 aboard the large US Navy [[destroyer leader]] {{USS|Norfolk|DL-1|6}}, its name was changed to the present ASROC.<ref>Bill Gunston ''Rocket & Missiles'', Salamander Books Ltd 1979, ISSB 0-517-26870-1</ref><ref>Norman Friedman ''U.S. Destroyers'' Naval Institute Press (April 1982), {{ISBN|08702-1733X}}, p. 280</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe first ASROC system using the MK-112 \"Matchbox\" launcher was developed in the 1950s and installed in the 1960s. This system was phased out in the 1990s and replaced with the [[RUM-139 VL-ASROC|RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC]], or \"VLA\".<ref name=\"NavInstGuid\" />\n\nAfter a surface ship, patrol plane or anti-submarine helicopter detects an enemy [[submarine]] by using [[sonar]] or other sensors, it could relay the sub's position to an ASROC-equipped ship for attack. The attacking ship would then fire an ASROC missile carrying an acoustic homing [[torpedo]]<ref name=Brit>\"Asroc\" in ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.

At a pre-determined point on the missile's trajectory, the payload separates from the missile and deploys a parachute to permit splashdown and water entry at a low speed and with minimum detectable noise. Water entry activates the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, and homes in on the target using either [[active sonar]] or [[passive sonar]].\n\n===W44 nuclear depth charge===\nThe W44 nuclear depth charge entered service in 1961,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=1983 |title=Tactical Nuclear Weapons |journal= [[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |volume=109 |issue=7 |page=125 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref> but was never used beyond one or two tests before the Limited [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] banning underwater nuclear tests went into effect. A total of 575 weapons were produced. The W44 weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg}} with a diameter of {{convert|13.75|inch|cm}} and length of {{convert|25.3|inch|cm}}. Following payload separation, the unguided W44 sank quickly to a predetermined depth where the 10-[[kiloton]] warhead detonated. The nuclear-armed ASROC was never used in combat. W44-armed ASROC missiles were retired by 1989, when all types of nuclear depth bombs were removed from deployment.<ref name=\"NavInstGuid\" />\n\n==Specific installations==\nThe 31 [[U.S. Navy]] {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}}s were all built with the Mark 16 Mod 7 ASROC Launching Group and MK 4 ASROC Weapons Handling System (AWHS) reload system. These had one standard Mark 112 octuple ASROC launcher, located immediately above a reload system holding an additional 16 assembled rounds (two complete reloads of eight missiles apiece). Thus, each ''Spruance''-class destroyer originally carried a maximum total of 24 ASROC.<ref>US Destroyers - Norman Friedman</ref>\n\nMost other US Navy and allied navy destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates, and several different classes of cruisers only carried the one ASROC \"matchbox\" MK 112 launcher with eight ASROC missiles (although later in service, some of those missiles could be replaced by the [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]] anti-ship missile). The \"matchbox\" Mk 112 launchers were capable of carrying a mixture of the two types. Reloads were carried in many classes, either on first level of the superstructure immediately abaft the launcher, or in a separate deckhouse just forward or abaft the Mk 112.\n\nThe MK 16 Launching Group also had configurations that supported RGM-84 Harpoon (onboard {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|0}} destroyer escorts (frigates)) or a variation of the Tartar missile in limited distribution.\n\nShips with the [[List of United States Navy Guided Missile Launching System|Mk 26 GMLS]], and late marks of the Mk 10 GMLS aboard the {{sclass-|Belknap|cruiser|2}}s, could accommodate ASROC in these power-loaded launchers (the Mk 13 GMLS was not able to fire the weapon, as the launcher rail was too short).\n\nMost ''Spruance''-class destroyers were later modified to include the [[Mark 41 Vertical Launch System|Mk 41 VLS]], these launchers are capable of carrying a mixture of the [[RUM-139 VL-ASROC]], the Tomahawk TLAM, and other missiles. All of the ''Spruance'' destroyers carried two separate quad Harpoon launchers.

On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded [[United Airlines Flight 93|United 93]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].\n\n==History==\nNami, much like [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Waleed al-Shehri]] and [[Mohand al-Shehri]], was born in the [['Asir Province]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].  Born to the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] tribe of [[Saudi Arabia]],<ref name=\"willalOmari\">Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others</ref> Nami served as a [[muezzin]] at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the summer of 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but never returned \u2013 instead travelling to the [[Al Farouq training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]] where he met  and befriended [[Waleed al-Shehri|Waleed]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]], two brothers from Khamis Mushayt, and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. The four reportedly pledged themselves to [[Jihad]] in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail \u2013 who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Muhammad]]'s companions.<ref>[[Boston Globe]], [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml Driving a Wedge: Part I]</ref> Dubbed \"Abu Hashim\", Nami was considered \"gentle in manner\" by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a [[mare]] along with [[Muhammad]], and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.<ref name=\"willalOmari\"/>\n\nDuring his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]]'s details that Nami had recently had [[laser eye surgery]], an uncited fact that does not reappear. \n\nBy October he had taken a prospective hijacker [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] from [[Afghanistan]] to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 \u2013 but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as ''student'' but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as [[Los Angeles]] \u2013 in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his [[passport]] (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to [[Afghanistan]]) as \"lost\", and procured a new one from [[Jeddah]] (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa.<ref name=\"visa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004|format=PDF}}</ref> He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application.  Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.\n\nIn mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami, [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get \"clean\" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.  \n\nWhile in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Nami purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]].\n\n===2001===\nIn March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] farewell video showing 13 of the \"muscle hijackers\" before they left their training centre in [[Kandahar]]; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.\n\nOn April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-542.html |title=Page 542 |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from [[Dubai]] with fellow-hijackers [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]].

Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39&nbsp;am and 7:48&nbsp;am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.\n\nDue to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.\n\nAt least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.\n\nPassengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. The hijackers crashed the plane into the [[Pennsylvania]]n countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the attacks, an employee of [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHe has been portrayed by British actor [[Jamie Harding]] in the 2006 film ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' and Asim Wali in the film ''[[Flight 93 (2006 film)|Flight 93]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|September 11 attacks|Terrorism}}\n* [[PENTTBOM]]\n* [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100807204647/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/index.html The Final 9/11 Commission Report]\n{{United Airlines Flight 93}}\n{{9-11 hijackers}}\n{{AmericanTerrorism}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nami, Ahmed}}\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:Participants in the September 11 attacks]]\n[[Category:Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members]]\n[[Category:United Airlines Flight 93]]\n[[Category:Saudi Arabian mass murderers]]", "sha1": "ggfzjfcjyveai5b715qhfx7xj6y563b"}}, {"title": "Ahmed al-Haznawi", "ns": "0", "id": "3222", "revision": {"id": "857117129", "parentid": "857117077", "timestamp": "2018-08-29T17:39:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "CRussG", "id": "19331679"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox person\n| name = Ahmed al-Haznawi\n| image = AAlhaznawi.JPG\n| image_size  = 150px\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1980|10|11}}\n| birth_name = Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi <br /> (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0648\u064a)\n| birth_place =  Hazna, [[al Bahah Province]], [[Saudi Arabia]]\n| death_date = {{death date and age|2001|9|11|1980|10|11}}\n| death_place =  [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| death_cause = Plane crash ([[United Airlines Flight 93]])\n}}\n'''Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0648\u064a }}, {{transl|ar|''A\u1e25mad Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-\u1e24azn\u0101w\u012b''}}) (October 11, 1980 \u2013 September 11, 2001) was one of four [[Organizers of the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nHe left his family to fight in [[Chechnya]] in 2000 but was probably sent to training camps in [[Afghanistan]].

The earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises ''Contra Gentes'' (''Against the Heathens'') and ''De Incarnatione'' (''On the Incarnation''), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nHowever Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Maximian persecution]] of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. Secondly, the ''Festal Epistles'' state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328.

After questioning Athanasius, Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the [[Sacramental matter and form|form and matter of the sacrament]] had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly [[Catechesis|catechized]].

[[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]], the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]] (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. According to [[Sozomen]]; \"the Bishop Alexander 'invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary.

Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of [[Neo-Platonism]].  Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the \"entirely allegorical interpretation of the text\". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes [[Homer]] more than once (''Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29'').

Forbes writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop.  \"When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; \"Give us Athanasius!\"  The Bishops had nothing better.

Forbes; \"Saint Athanasius\", 1919</ref>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: \"On the death of Alexander, five months after the termination of the Council of Nicaea, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. He at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">T. Gilmartin, ''Manual of Church History'', Vol. 1. Ch XVII, 1890</ref>\n\nAthanasius' episcopate began on 9 May 328 as the [[Councils of Alexandria|Alexandrian Council]] elected Athanasius to succeed the aged Alexander. That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c. 8 June 328 \u2013 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression \"Athanasius contra mundum\" or \"Athanasius against the world\".<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nDuring his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] and [[Libya in the Roman era|Libya]]. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [[Pachomius]], which proved very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against [[Arianism|Arians]] within the [[Byzantine Empire]] that would occupy much of his life.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\n====First exile====\n\nAthanasius' first problem lay with [[Meletius of Lycopolis]] and his followers, who had failed to abide by the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. That council also [[anathematized]] Arius. Accused of mistreating Arians and Meletians, Athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the [[First Synod of Tyre]], in 335. There, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius.<ref name=\"EA\"/> On 6 November, both sides of the dispute met with Emperor [[Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].<ref>Barnes, Timothy D., ''Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 23</ref> At that meeting, the Arians claimed Athanasius would try to cut off essential Egyptian grain supplies to Constantinople. He was found guilty, and sent into exile to [[Augusta Treverorum]] in Gaul (now [[Trier]] in Germany).<ref name=\"EA\"/><ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\">Christianity, ''Daily Telegraph'' 1999</ref>\n\nWhen Athanasius reached his destination in exile in 336, [[Maximinus of Trier]] received him, but not as a disgraced person. Athanasius stayed with him for two years. [[Paul I of Constantinople]], who was banished by the Emperor Constantius, also stayed with him. Maximinus cautioned the Emperor Constans against the Arians, revealing their plots.<ref name=\"Butler1860\">Butler, Albin, Butler's Lives of The Saints 1860, Volume 1.</ref>\n\n====Second exile====\n[[File:Hosios Loukas Crypt (south east groin-vault) - Athanasios.jpg|thumb|180px|Fresco at [[Hosios Loukas]], Greece (11th century)]]\n[[File:Athanasius of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|180px|Statue of the saint in St Athanasius's [[Catholic Church]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]]]\n\nWhen Emperor [[Constantine I]] died, Athanasius was allowed to return to his [[Episcopal see|See]] of Alexandria. Shortly thereafter, however, Constantine's son, the new [[List of Roman emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantius II]], renewed the order for Athanasius's banishment in 338. 'Within a few weeks he set out for Rome to lay his case before the Church at large.  He had made his appeal to Pope Julius, who took up his cause with whole-heartedness that never wavered down to the day of that holy pontiff's death.  The pope summoned a synod of bishops to meet in Rome.  After a careful and detailed examination of the entire case, the primate's innocence was proclaimed to the Christian world.' <ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>.  During this time, [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria, usurping the absent Athanasius. Athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual ''Festal Letters'', in which he also announced on which date [[Easter]] would be celebrated that year.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nIn 339 or 340, nearly one hundred bishops met at Alexandria, declared in favor of Athanasius,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_VJAwAAQBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA50&dq=athanasius%20alexandria%20council%20340&pg=RA1-PA47#v=onepage&q=339%20or%20340&f=false | title=A History of the Councils of the Church: from the Original Documents, to the close of the Second Council of Nicaea A.D. 787 | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | author=Clark, William R. | year=2007 | page=47 | isbn=9781556352478}}</ref> and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the Eusebian faction at Tyre. Plus, [[Pope Julius I]] wrote to the supporters of Arius strongly urging Athanasius's reinstatement, but that effort proved in vain. Pope Julius I called a [[synod]] in Rome in 340  to address the matter, which proclaimed Athanasius the rightful bishop of Alexandria.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMhzlnY0P0QC&lpg=PA1&dq=history%20of%20ecumenical%20councils&pg=PA82#v=snippet&q=340%20Julius%20called&f=false | title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325\u2013787): Their History and Theology | publisher=Liturgical Press | author=Davis, Leo Donald | year=1983 | page=82| isbn=9780814656167 }}</ref>\n\nEarly in the year 343 we find Athanasius had travelled, via Rome, from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul; nowadays Belgium / Holland and surrounding areas, where [[Hosius of C\u00f3rdoba]] was Bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the West. Together they set out for Sardica, [[Sofia]]. A full Council of the Church was convened / summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. The travel was a mammoth task in itself.  At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic \u2013 an absurd charge. They even produced Arsenius' severed hand.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/>).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337\u2013352), (Ad an. 343).  One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, [[Philippopolis (Thracia)]], where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHis innocence was reaffirmed at the [[Council of Sardica]].  Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if the Saint attempt to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from [[Sardica]] to [[Naissus]] in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/> It was Hosius who presided over the [[Council of Sardica]], as he did for the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent.<ref name=\"EB1878\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/athanasius|title=St. Athanasius - Christian Classics Ethereal Library - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> &.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> He celebrated his last Easter in exile in [[Aquileia]] in April 345, received by bishop Fortunatianus.<ref>Barnes, Timothy David, ''Athanasius and Constantius'', Harvard 2001, p. 66</ref>\n\nEastern Bishop [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] died, probably of violence in June of 345. (Gregory, an Arian bishop, had taken over the See of Alexandria.) The emissary to the Emperor Constantius sent by the bishops of the Sardica Council to report the finding of the Council, who had been met at first with most insulting treatment, now received a favourable hearing.  Constantius was forced to reconsider his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother Constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the Persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield.   But three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of Athanasius.   He passed rapidly from [[Aquileia]] to [[Treves]], from Treves to Rome and from Rome by way of the northern route to Adrianople, [[Edirne]], and Antioch, [[Ankara]], where he met Constantius.  He was accorded a gracious interview by the Emperor, and sent back to his See in triumph,  and began his memorable ten years of peace, which lasted to the third exile, 356.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nPope Julius died in April 352, and was succeeded by [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]].  For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the \"homoousion\", had been studiously omitted.  In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world.  With his friends scattered, the saintly Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest.  It was the beginning of his third exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: By Constantius' order, the sole ruler of  The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the [[Council of Arles (353)|Council of Arles in 353]], was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of [[Capua]], in the name of Pope Liberius.  The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius.  The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated.  To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control the Council in Milan.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThree hundred bishops assembled in Milan, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355.  They met in the Church of Milan.  Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death.  All, with the exception of [[Dionysius (bishop of Milan)]], and the two Papal Legates, viz., [[Eusebius of Vercelli]] and [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius.  Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Third exile====\n[[File:Saint Athanasius.jpg|thumb|300px|Athanasius at the Council of Nicea, [[William of Tyre]] manuscripts.]]\nThrough the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian bishop, [[George of Cappadocia]], was now appointed to rule the see of Alexandria. Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of [[Upper Egypt]], where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; \"Apology to Constantius\", the \"Apology for his Flight\", the \"Letter to the Monks\", and the \"History of the Arians\".<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nConstantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service.<ref>Graves, Dan.

Retrieved 8 March 2016.</ref> Athanasius fled to [[Upper Egypt]], where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work ''Four Orations against the Arians'' and defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''. Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nConstantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to [[Stara Zagora|Beroea]], in Thrace.  He sent expensive presents if he were to accept the Arian position, which Liberius refused. He sent him five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" which Liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where in a conference recorded by Theodore, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nLiberius went into exile.  Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign.  The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius.  He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court.  He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed  by the Arians at [[Sirmium]]. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Niceae]], as Theodoret testifies. ([[Theodoret]], Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.).<ref>Butler, Albin, Butler's Lives of The Saints 1860, Volume 1</ref>  The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court.  Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed.<ref name=\"Christianity, Daily Telegraph 1999\"/> Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nT. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII:\n<blockquote>The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at [[Seleucia in Isauria]], and those of the West to [[Rimini]] in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at [[Sirmium]], to agree a formula of faith. A \"Homoeon\" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be \"like the Father\". The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the \"Homoiousion\", (see: [[Homoiousian]]), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/></blockquote>\n\nAcacius, the leader of the \"Homoean\" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the \"Home Synod\", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that [[Jerome]] said: \" ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents.  The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died on 4 November 361 and was succeeded by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].  The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria.  George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered.  An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope.  An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the \"Galileans\" to return to their \"towns and provinces\".  Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February 362.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 362 he convened a council at Alexandria, and presided over it with [[Eusebius of Vercelli]]. Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}</ref>\n\nWith characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty.  To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the \"Chronicon Athanasianum\" (XXXV) as a \"philosopher\", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fourth exile====\n\nIn 362, the new Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], remaining there with the [[Desert Fathers]] until Julian's death on 26 June 363. Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nHis first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Early in September 363 he set out for [[Antioch on the Orontes]], bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied.  At Antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith.  The following February Jovian died; and in October, 364, Athanasius was once more an exile.<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\n====Fifth exile====\n\nTwo years later, the Emperor [[Valens]], who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius. This time Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb<ref name=\"EA\"/> in a Christian cemetery. It was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb. (Soz., \"Hist. Eccl.\", VI, xii; Soc., \"Hist. Eccl.\", IV, xii).<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nThe accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party.  He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius, but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees.  The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor.  But Athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him.  He quietly withdrew from Alexandria, 5 October, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name=\"Clifford1907\"/>\n\nIn 366 Pope Liberius died and was succeeded by Pope Damasus, a man of strong character and holy life.  Two years later, in a council of the Church, it was decreed that no Bishop should be consecrated unless he held the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Nicea]]. (F. A. Forbes).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Final years and death====\nAfter returning to Alexandria in early 366, Athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]]. On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n== Works ==\nIn [[Coptic literature]], Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Coptic literature |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Polemical and theological works ===\nAthanasius was not a speculative theologian. As he stated in his ''First Letters to Serapion'', he held on to \"the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers.\"<ref name=\"EA\"/>  He held that not only was the Son of God [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with the Father, but so was the [[Holy Spirit]], which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.<ref name=\"EA\"/>\n\nAthanasius' ''\"Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea\"'' (''De Decretis''), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter from 367 is the first known listing of all those books now accepted as the New Testament.<ref name=\"EA\"/> ([[Development of the New Testament canon|Earlier similar lists]] vary by the omission or addition of a few books.)\n\nExamples of Athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include ''Orations Against the Arians'', his defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'' in the 360s, and ''On the Holy Spirit''), against [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonianism]] and ''On the Incarnation''.\n\nAthanasius also wrote a two-part ''Against the Heathen'' and ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''. Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy,<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez in ''A History of Christian Thought'' notes (p. 292) that E. Schwartz places this work later, around 335, but \"his arguments have not been generally accepted\". The introduction to the CSMV translation of ''On the Incarnation'' places the work in 318, around the time Athanasius was ordained to the diaconate (''St Athanasius On the Incarnation'', Mowbray, England 1953)</ref> they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption.<ref name=\"EA\"/> Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief, referencing {{bibleref2|John|1:1\u20134}}, that the [[Son of God]], the eternal Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.\n\nHis other important works include his ''Letters to Serapion'', which defends the [[divinity]] of the [[Holy Spirit]]. In a letter to Epictetus of Corinth, Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of Christ. Another of his letters, to Dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nAthanasius also wrote several works of [[Biblical exegesis]], primarily on [[Old Testament]] materials. The most important of these is his ''Epistle to Marcellinus'' (PG 27:12\u201345) on how to incorporate Psalm saying into one's spiritual practice. Excerpts remain of his discussions concerning the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Song of Solomon]], and [[Psalms]].\n\nPerhaps his most notable letter was his Festal Letter, written to his Church in Alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence.  This letter clearly shows his stand that accepting Jesus as the Divine Son of God is not optional but necessary: {{quote|I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you.

The establishment of the canon was not a unilateral decision by a bishop in Alexandria, but the result of a process of careful investigation and deliberation, as documented in a codex of the Greek Bible and, twenty-seven years later, in his festal letter.<ref name=Thiede/>\n\n[[Pope Damasus I]], the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius. A [[Synod of Hippo|synod in Hippo]] in 393 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]), and the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.<ref>Von Dehsen, Christian.

Because Athanasius' Canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the one used by Protestant churches today, many Protestants point to Athanasius as the Father of the Canon.<ref name=Robt/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html|title=Excerpt from Letter 39 |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Episcopal consecration===\n\nIn the light of Mother F. A. Forbes' research and reference to Pope Saint Gregory's writings, it would appear that Athanasius was constrained to be Bishop: She writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop. \"When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; \"Give us Athanasius!\" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us...\" ([[Pope Gregory I]], would have full access to the Vatican Archives).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlban Butler, writes on the subject: \"Five months after this great Council, Nicae, St Alexander lying on his death-bed, recommended to his clergy and people the choice of Athanasius for his successor, thrice repeating his name. In consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all Egypt assembled at Alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of Athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326.  He seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age.\"<ref name=\"Butler1860\"/>\n\n=== Supporters ===\n[[File:Athanasius_and_Cyril.jpg|left|thumb|Athanasius (left) and his supporter [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. 17th century depiction.]]\n\nChristian denominations worldwide revere Athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. They cite his defense of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u20134}} and his significant theological works ([[C. S. Lewis]] calls ''On the Incarnation of the Word of God'' a \"masterpiece\")<ref>Introduction to St. Athanasius on the Incarnation. Translated and edited by Sister Penelope Lawson, published by Mowbray 1944. p. 9</ref> as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with [[Anthony the Great]], the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the Christian monastic movement.\n\nThe Gospel of St. John and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the Divinity of Jesus. This Gospel in itself is the greatest support of Athanasius' stand.  The Gospel of St. John's first chapter began to be said at the end of Mass, we believe as a result of Athanasius, and his life's stand, but quietly, and was later - together with some other originally private devotions - absorbed by the liturgical service proper as so-called ''Last Gospel''{{bibleref2c-nb|John|1:1\u201314}}<ref>However, the Last Gospel was for a long time of Church history often replaced by the standard Gospel of the outranked and commemorated day (e. g. Mass of the Saint of the day, Last Gospel of the Sunday <!-- sic. This is not the place to speak about liturgy reforms, but until the 1910s, Saint's feasts usually outranked Sundays, and if the Last Gospel had been said loud, Sunday Gospels would have been what would have most been heard by parishioners.!-->); and after the [[Mass of Paul VI|last liturgy reform]], the Last Gospel has been suppressed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the Middle Ages; the practice of saying it at the altar grew, and eventually [[Pius V]] made this practice universal for the Roman Rite in his edition of the Missal (1570).<ref name=\"Fortescue1907\">Fortescue, Adrian, Catholic Encyclopedia 1907, Volume 6, pp. 662\u2013663 \"Gospel\"</ref>  It became a firm custom with exceptions in using an other Gospel in use from 1920. <ref name=\"Pope Benedict XV\">Pope Benedict XV, Missale Romanum, IX Additions & Variations of the Rubrics of The Missal</ref><ref name=\"Jungmann\">See also: Jungmann, El Sacrificio de la Misa, No. 659, 660</ref>\n\n[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (330\u2013390) begins Or. 21 with: \"When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith.\"<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria]] (370\u2013444) in the first letter says: \"Athanasius is one who can be trusted: he would not say anything that is not in accord with sacred scripture.\"  (Ep 1).\n\nMany modern historians point out that such a hostile attitude towards Athanasius is based on an unfair judgment of historical sources.<ref>Arnold, 24\u201399; Ng, 273\u2013292.</ref>\n\nSaint [[Pope Pius X]] said in a letter to philosopher-friend and correspondent in the closing years of his life, (Epist. lxxi, ad Max.): \"Let what was confessed by the fathers of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] prevail\".<ref name=\"Clifford1930\" />\n\n=== Critics ===\nThroughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. Classics scholar [[Timothy Barnes]] recounts ancient allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent.<ref name = \"wxdxek\">Barnes, Timothy D., Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1993), 37</ref> Athanasius used \"Arian\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity.<ref>Barnes \"Athanasius and Constantius\", 14, 128</ref> Athanasius called many of his opponents \"Arian\", except for [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] (Miletus).<ref>Barnes \"Athanasius and Constantius\",135</ref>\n\nScholars now believe that the [[Arianism|Arian Party]] was not monolithic,<ref>Haas, Christopher, \"The Arians of Alexandria\", Vigiliae Christianae Vol. 47, no. 3 (1993), 239</ref> but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum.<ref>Chadwick, Henry, \"Faith and Order at the Council of Nicaea\", ''Harvard Theological Review'' LIII (Cambridge Mass: 1960),173</ref><ref>Williams, 63</ref><ref>Kannengiesser \"Alexander and Arius\", 403</ref> They supported the tenets of [[Origenism|Origenist]] thought and [[subordinationism|subordinationist]] theology,<ref>Kannengiesser, \"Athanasius of Alexandria vs. Arius: The Alexandrian Crisis\", in The Roots of Egyptian Christianity (Studies in Antiquity and Christianity), ed. Birger A. Pearson and James E. Goehring (1986),208</ref> but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \"Arian\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius.<ref>Williams, 82</ref> In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.<ref>Rubinstein, Richard, ''When Jesus Became God, The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome'', 1999</ref> However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe old allegations continue to be made against Athanasius however many centuries later. For example, [[Richard E. Rubenstein]] suggests that Athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in [[Alexandria]] under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that Athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. Thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported Athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E., ''When Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ's Divinity in the Last Days of Rome'' (New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1999), 105\u2013106</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Athanasius.

{{Respell|AY|zorz}}; {{lang-pt|A\u00e7ores}}, {{IPA-pt|\u0250\u02c8so\u027e\u0268\u0283|}}), officially the '''Autonomous Region of the Azores''' (''{{lang|pt|Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores}}''), is one of the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (along with [[Madeira]] (''Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira''). It is an [[archipelago]] composed of nine [[High island|volcanic island]]s in the North Atlantic Ocean about {{convert|1360|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of continental [[Portugal]], about {{convert|1643|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Lisbon]], in [[continental Portugal]], about {{convert|1507|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Morocco]], and about {{convert|1925|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]].\n\nIts main industries are agriculture, [[dairy farming]], livestock, [[fishing in Portugal|fishing]], and [[tourism in Portugal|tourism]], which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors. The main settlement of the Azores is [[Ponta Delgada]].\n\nThere are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are [[Flores (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]], to the west; [[Graciosa]], [[Terceira]], [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]], and [[Faial Island|Faial]] in the centre; and [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], and the [[Formigas|Formigas Reef]] to the east. They extend for more than {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.\n\nAll the islands have [[volcanic]] origins, although some, such as [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. [[Mount Pico]], on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]], is the highest point in Portugal, at {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. If measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean to their peaks, which thrust high above the surface of the Atlantic, the Azores are actually some of the tallest mountains on the planet.\n\nThe climate of the Azores is very mild for such a northerly location, being influenced by its distance from the continents and by the passing [[Gulf Stream]]. Due to the marine influence, temperatures remain mild year-round. Daytime temperatures normally fluctuate between {{convert|16|C|F}} and {{convert|25|C|F}} depending on season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/en/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/020/|title=Ponta Delgada Climate Normals 1981\u20132010|publisher=IPMA|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/en/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/026/|title=Angra do Hero\u00edsmo Climate Normals 1981\u20132010|publisher=IPMA|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} or below {{convert|3|C|F}} are unknown in the major population centres. It is also generally wet and cloudy.\n\nThe culture, dialect, cuisine, and traditions of the Azorean islands vary considerably, because these once-uninhabited and remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Azores}}\nA small number of alleged [[Hypogeum|hypogea]], earthen structures carved into rocks that were used for burials, have been identified on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira by Portuguese archaeologist Nuno Ribeiro, who speculated that they might date back 2000 years, alluding to a human presence on the island before the Portuguese.<ref>{{Citation |website=Correio da Manh\u00e3 |language=Portuguese |accessdate=18 June 2011 |title=Estruturas podem ter mais de dois mil anos: Monumentos funer\u00e1rios descobertos nos A\u00e7ores |date=5 March 2011 |location=Lisbon, Portugal |editor=J.M.A. |publisher=Cofina Media |url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/monumentos-funerarios-descobertos-nos-acores}}</ref> These kinds of structures have been used in the Azores to store cereals, however, and suggestions by Ribeiro that they might be burial sites are unconfirmed.

Solid confirmation of a pre-Portuguese human presence in the archipelago has not yet been published.\n\n===European discovery===\n[[File:Azores old map.jpg|thumb|1584 map of the Azores.]]\n\nThe islands were known in the fourteenth century, and parts of them appear in the [[Atlas Catalan]]. In 1427, a captain sailing for [[Henry the Navigator]], possibly [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho]], may have rediscovered the Azores, but this is not certain. In [[Thomas Ashe (writer)|Thomas Ashe]]'s 1813 work, ''A History of the Azores'',<ref name=\"History1813\">{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Ashe|title=History of the Azores, or Western Islands|year=1813|publisher=Oxford University}}</ref> the author identified a [[Flemish people|Fleming]], Joshua Vander Berg of [[Bruges]], who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to [[Lisbon]].<ref name=\"History1813\"/> He stated that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal.<ref name=\"History1813\"/> Other stories note the discovery of the first islands ([[S\u00e3o Miguel Island]], [[Santa Maria Island]] and [[Terceira Island]]) by sailors in the service of [[Henry the Navigator]], although there are few documents to support the claims.\n\nAlthough it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name from the [[northern goshawk|goshawk]] ({{lang|pt|a\u00e7or}} in Portuguese), a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted in the islands.\n\n===Settlement===\n{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Vista sobre Angra do Heroismo.jpg|thumb|[[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], the oldest continuously settled town in the archipelago of the Azores and UNESCO World Heritage Site]]\n\nThere were no large animals on Santa Maria, so after its discovery and before settlement began, sheep were let loose on the island to supply future settlers with food. Settlement did not take place right away, however. There was not much interest among the Portuguese people in an isolated archipelago so far from civilization. [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral]] patiently gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433\u20131436), however, and sailed to establish colonies first on Santa Maria and then on S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\nSettlers cleared bush and rocks to plant crops\u2014grain, grape vines, [[sugar cane]], and other plants suitable for local use and of commercial value. They brought domesticated animals, such as chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and [[Domestic pig|pigs]] and built houses and established villages.\n\nThe archipelago was largely settled from mainland Portugal. Portuguese settlers came from the provinces of [[Algarve]], [[Minho Province|Minho]], [[Alentejo Province|Alentejo]] and [[Ribatejo Province|Ribatejo]] as well as [[Madeira]]. S\u00e3o Miguel was first settled in 1449, the settlers \u2013 mainly from the [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]], Alto Alentejo and Algarve areas of mainland Portugal, under the command of Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral \u2013 landed at the site of modern-day [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]]. Many early settlers were Portuguese Sephardic Jews who fled the pressures of inquisition in mainland Portugal. In 1522, [[Vila Franca do Campo]], then the capital of the island, was devastated by an [[1522 Vila Franca earthquake|earthquake and landslide]] that killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to [[Ponta Delgada]]. The town of Vila Franca do Campo was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port. Ponta Delgada received its city status in 1546. From the first settlement, the pioneers applied themselves to agriculture and by the 15th century Graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. The goods were sent to Terceira largely because of the proximity of the island.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including [[Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], the French writer who passed through upon his escape to America during the French revolution; [[Almeida Garrett]], the Portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert of Monaco]], the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the Azores. He arrived on his yacht ''Hirondelle'', and visited the ''furna da caldeira'', the noted hot springs grotto. In 1869, the author [[Mark Twain]] published ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'', a travel book, where he described his time in the Azores.\n\nThe first reference to the island of S\u00e3o Jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. In 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble Flemish native ''Wilhelm Van der Haegen''. Arriving at [[Topo (Azores)|Topo]], where he lived and died, he became known as ''Guilherme da Silveira'' to the islanders. [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] received the captaincy of the island in 1483. [[Velas]] became a town before the end of the 15th century. By 1490, there were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, S\u00e3o Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was responsible for this settlement. His sister, [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabel]], was married to [[Philip the Good|Duke Philip of Burgundy]] of which Flanders was a part. There was a revolt against Philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. Isabel appealed to Henry to allow some of the unruly Flemings to settle in the Azores. He granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.\n\nThe [[Human settlement|settlement]] of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of Algarve and [[Alentejo]]. In 1583, [[Philip II of Spain]], as [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]], sent his fleet to clear the Azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the Azores as a staging post for a rival [[pretender]] to the Portuguese throne. Following the success of his fleet at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by Philip II. Opponents receiving the news variously portrayed Philip II as a despot or \"[[Black Legend]]\"; the sort of insult widely made against contemporary monarchs engaged in aggressive empire building and the [[European Wars of Religion]]. An English [[Azores Voyage of 1589|raid of the Azores]] in 1589 successfully plundered some harbouring ships and islands; a repeat eight years later, the [[Islands Voyage]], failed. Spain held the Azores under the \"Babylonian captivity\" of 1580\u20131642. In the late 16th century, the Azores and [[Madeira]] began to face problems of overpopulation. Spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to [[Brazil]].<ref name=\"ImperialAge1989\">{{cite book|first=G.V|last=Scammell|title=The First Imperial Age|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman}}</ref>\n\n===Iberian Union===\n{{main|Conquest of the Azores}}\nFollowing the death of [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry, the Cardinal-King of Portugal]] the nation fell into a dynastic crisis with [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580#Claimants to the throne|various pretenders]] to the Crown of Portugal.<ref name=\"MeloBento34\">Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.34</ref> Following his proclamation in Santar\u00e9m, [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] was acclaimed in the Azores in 1580 (through his envoy Ant\u00f3nio da Costa), but was expelled from the continent following the [[Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara (1580)|Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara]].<ref name=MeloBento34/> Yet, through the administration of Cipriano de Figueiredo, governor of Terceira (who continued to govern Terceira in the name of ill-fated, former-king [[Sebastian of Portugal]]), the Azoreans resisted attempts to conquer the islands (including specifically at the [[Battle of Salga]]).<ref name=\"MeloBento36\">Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.36</ref> It was Figueiredo and Violante do Canto who helped organize a resistance on Terceira that influenced some of the response of the other islands, even as internal politics and support for Philip's faction increased on the other islands (including specifically on S\u00e3o Miguel, where the Gon\u00e7alvez da C\u00e2mara family supported the Spanish pretender).<ref name=MeloBento36/>\n\nThe Azores were the last part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] resisted any official recognition) and were returned to Portuguese control with the end of the [[Iberian Union]] in 1640, not by the professional military, who were used in the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] in the mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] garrison.\n\n===Liberal Wars===\n{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}\nThe [[Liberal Wars|Portuguese Civil War]] (1828\u20131834) had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], the Liberals won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making [[Terceira Island]] the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency ({{lang|pt|Conselho de Reg\u00eancia}}) of [[Maria II of Portugal]] was established.\n\nBeginning in 1868, Portugal issued its stamps overprinted with \"{{lang|pt|A\u00c7ORES}}\" for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.\n\nFrom 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, equivalent (except in area) to those in the [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#Districts|Portuguese mainland]]. The division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).\n\n*'''Angra do Hero\u00edsmo''' consisted of Terceira, S\u00e3o Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] on Terceira.\n*'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.\n*'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\n===Modern times===\nIn 1931 the Azores (together with Madeira and Portuguese Guinea) revolted against the [[Ditadura Nacional]] and were held briefly by military rebels.<ref>{{Cite journal|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=22 June 2011|title=A History of Spain and Portugal \u2013 Ch27|year=1972|location=Madison WI|author=Payne, Stanley|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne27.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525184237/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne27.htm|archivedate= 25 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943, during [[World War II]], the Portuguese ruler [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] leased air and naval bases in the Azores to Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_neutrality_europe.asp |title=The Role of Portugal -co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, \"Dimensions\", Vol 11, No 1, 1997 |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> The occupation of these facilities in October 1943 was codenamed ''[[Operation Alacrity]]'' by the British.<ref>{{cite web|author=M B Barrass |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Bromet.htm |title=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation: Air Vice-Marshal Sir Geoffrey Bromet |publisher=Royal Air Force Organization (RAFWeb.org) |date=2001\u20132008 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis was a key turning point in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], enabling the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the U.S. Navy to provide aerial coverage in the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]]. This helped them to protect [[convoy]]s and to hunt hostile German [[U-boat]]s.\n\nIn 1944, the U.S. constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of [[Terceira]], and it is named [[Lajes Field]]. This air base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a large farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This air base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support the American and [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. During the [[Cold War]], [[U.S. Navy]] [[P-3 Orion]] [[antisubmarine warfare]] squadrons patrolled the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] for [[Soviet Navy]] [[submarine]]s and surface [[warship]]s. Since its opening, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling American [[cargo plane]]s bound for [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. The U.S. Navy keeps a small [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] of its ships at the harbor of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], {{convert|3|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} southeast of Lajes Field.\n\nThe airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from the other islands in the Azores, Europe, Africa, and North America.\n\nIn 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores ({{lang|pt|Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores}}), one of the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]], and the subdistricts of the Azores were eliminated.\n\nIn 2003, the Azores saw international attention when United States President [[George W.

Rivas Martinez data, presents several different bioclimatic zones for the Azores<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm|title=Mapas bioclim\u00e1ticos y biogeogr\u00e1ficos|website=www.globalbioclimatics.org}}</ref> [[Seasonal lag]] is extreme in the low-sun half of the year, with December being milder than April in terms of mean temperatures.\nAzores have the warmest winters in Europe (still within the European continental plate). During summer the lag is somewhat lower, with August being the warmest month. There has never been a frost, snowfall or freeze ever recorded at sea level on any of the islands. The coldest weather in winter usually comes from northwesterly [[Air Mass|air masses]] originating from [[Labrador]] in Canada. But because those air masses are modified as they pass across the warmer Atlantic Ocean, temperatures by day even then exceed {{convert|10|C|F}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ponta Delgada\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.2\n|Feb record high C = 20.4\n|Mar record high C = 22.8\n|Apr record high C = 22.6\n|May record high C = 23.2\n|Jun record high C = 25.6\n|Jul record high C = 28.2\n|Aug record high C = 28.8\n|Sep record high C = 28.6\n|Oct record high C = 26.2\n|Nov record high C = 25.5\n|Dec record high C = 22.6\n|Jan high C = 16.8\n|Feb high C = 16.6\n|Mar high C = 17.0\n|Apr high C = 17.7\n|May high C = 19.1\n|Jun high C = 21.4\n|Jul high C = 23.9\n|Aug high C = 25.3\n|Sep high C = 24.3\n|Oct high C = 21.9\n|Nov high C = 19.4\n|Dec high C = 17.8\n|year high C = 20.1\n|Jan low C = 12.2\n|Feb low C = 11.5\n|Mar low C = 12.0\n|Apr low C = 12.3\n|May low C = 13.6\n|Jun low C = 15.8\n|Jul low C = 17.8\n|Aug low C = 19.0\n|Sep low C = 18.4\n|Oct low C = 16.5\n|Nov low C = 14.3\n|Dec low C = 12.9\n|year low C = 14.7\n|Jan record low C = 4.4\n|Feb record low C = 3.7\n|Mar record low C = 4.2\n|Apr record low C = 5.5\n|May record low C = 6.6\n|Jun record low C = 8.3\n|Jul record low C = 12.0\n|Aug record low C = 13.0\n|Sep record low C = 12.2\n|Oct record low C = 10.4\n|Nov record low C = 7.6\n|Dec record low C = 6.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 96.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 84.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 87.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 76.7\n|May precipitation mm = 72.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 39.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 26.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 46.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 91.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 108.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 108.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 146.9\n|Jan sun = 97\n|Feb sun = 103\n|Mar sun = 120\n|Apr sun = 141\n|May sun = 174\n|Jun sun = 163\n|Jul sun = 208\n|Aug sun = 213\n|Sep sun = 175\n|Oct sun = 142\n|Nov sun = 109\n|Dec sun = 93\n|year sun = 1738\n|source 1 = Instituto de Meteorologia<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/020/\n|title=Normais Climatol\u00f3gicas (1981\u20132010)\n|language=Portuguese\n|publisher=Instituto de Meteorologia\n|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}</ref> \n|source 2 = NOAA (sun, 1961\u20131990)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/PO/08513.TXT\n| title = Ponta Delgada Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = July 9, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=July 2015\n}}\n[[File:Pico_da_S\u00e9,_Inverno_de_2008,_ilha_das_Flores,_A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|[[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]], Azores, Portugal]]\nIn addition, the [[Instituto de Meteorologia]] has identified the following weather extremes:\n* Highest minimum air temperature: {{convert|24.3|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}, in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], Terceira (30 June 1996)\n* Lowest minimum air temperature: {{convert|-3.5|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}, in [[Ch\u00e3 das Lagoinhas]], S\u00e3o Miguel (2 January 1973)\n* Highest maximum air temperature: {{convert|39.0|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}, in July (Exact date and location unknown)\n* Lowest maximum air temperature: {{convert|4.0|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}, Ch\u00e3 das Lagoinhas, S\u00e3o Miguel (20 February 1972)\n* Maximum precipitation in 24 hours: {{convert|276|mm|2|abbr=on}}, [[Furnas]], S\u00e3o Miguel (3 October 1974)\n* Maximum wind speed: >168&nbsp;km/hour, Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, (Terceira 2 November 1995)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/extremos/ |title=Maximum wind speed recorded during Hurricane Tanya (1995) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= |publisher=Institute of Meteorology, IP Portugal |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712075018/http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/extremos/ |archive-date=12 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hurricanes====\nThe Azores are known for small hurricanes. A total of 14 [[Tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s have affected the region in history. Most of them were either [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] or [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] when they affected the region, although several [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 1 hurricanes]] have reached the Azores. Only one major hurricane has ever impacted the Azores; [[Hurricane Ophelia (2017)|Hurricane Ophelia]] in 2017, at Category 3 intensity. The following storms have impacted the region while at Category 1 strength: [[Hurricane Fran (1973)|Hurricane Fran]] in 1973, [[Hurricane Emmy]] in 1976, [[Hurricane Gordon (2006)|Hurricane Gordon]] in 2006, [[Hurricane Gordon (2012)|Hurricane Gordon]] in 2012 and [[Hurricane Alex (2016)|Hurricane Alex]] in 2016. Several tropical storms have hit the region, including [[Tropical Storm Irma (1978)|Tropical Storm Irma]] in 1978, [[Hurricane Bonnie (1992)|Hurricane Bonnie]] in 1992, [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Charley|Hurricane Charley]] in 1992, [[Hurricane Erika (1997)|Hurricane Erika]] in 1997, and [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gaston|Hurricane Gaston]] in 2016. Storms that were extratropical when they impacted the region include [[Hurricane Tanya (1995)|Hurricane Tanya]] in 1995, [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]] in 2003 and [[Tropical Storm Grace (2009)|Tropical Storm Grace]] in 2009. In addition, the [[2005 Azores subtropical storm]] affected the region in October 2005.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}\nThe Azores are divided into 19 municipalities ({{lang|pt|concelhos}}); each municipality is further divided into parishes ({{lang|pt|freguesias}}), of which there is a [[List of parishes of Portugal|total of 156]] in all of the Azores.

Angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra]], the episcopal see of the Azores.\n\n{{wide image|Es2004 terceira.jpg|1100px|Panoramic view near S\u00e3o Mateus, [[Terceira]], June 2004}}\n\n===Population===\n[[File:Flores west.jpg|thumb|[[Faj\u00e3 Grande]], the westernmost village in the Azores, Portugal and Europe]]\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, population in the Azores was 246,746 at a density of {{convert|106|PD/km2}}.\n\nThe Azores were uninhabited when Portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; the settlement process was initiated in 1439 with individuals from various regions of mainland Portugal and from [[Madeira]]. The islands were populated mainly by Portuguese descendants immigrants from [[Algarve]], [[Alentejo]], and [[Minho (province)|Minho]]; in an effort to escape the dangers of the Portuguese inquisition on mainland Portugal, however, many Portuguese Sephardic Jews settled on the islands in large numbers. Azorean Jews had surnames such as: Rodrigues, Pacheco, Oliveira, Pereira, Pimentel, Nunes, Mendes, Pinto, \u00c1lvares, Henriques, Cardozo, Teixeira, Vasconcelos etc. The islands were also settled by Moorish prisoners, and African slaves from Guinea, Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9; Flemish, French and Galicians also contributed to the initial settlement. Thus the Azorean population received a significant contribution from people with genetic backgrounds other than Portuguese.\n\nThe nature of the economy dictated that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]] never became common in the Azores because they were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean. Only a few remained in the Azores to help with domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying [[History of slavery|African slaves]].<ref name=\"Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia\">{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA42| title=Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia|author1=Melvin Eugene Page  |author2=Penny M.

It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the Legislative Assembly, a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal [[suffrage]] for a four-year term; the Regional Government and Presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a President, a Vice-President and seven Regional Secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the President of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the President of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the President).\n\nSince becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in [[Ponta Delgada]], the legislative branch in [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], and the judicial branch in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]].\n\nThe islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. In addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: Topo (today integrated into the municipality of [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]], S\u00e3o Jorge); [[Praia (Santa Cruz da Graciosa)|Praia]] (today integrated into municipality of [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa]]); [[Vila de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]] (today an integral part of the municipality of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo); Capelas (now part of the municipality of Ponta Delgada); and \u00c1gua de Pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of Lagoa). These civil parishes still retain their titles of \"vila\" in name only; the populations of Capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. The municipalities are further subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of [[Corvo (Azores)|Corvo]] (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).\n\nAzorean politics is dominated by the two largest Portuguese political parties, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]] and the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party (PS)]], the latter holding a majority in the Regional Legislative Assembly. The [[Democratic and Social Center / People's Party]] (CDS/PP), the [[Left Bloc]] (BE), the [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition]] (CDU) and the [[People's Monarchist Party (Portugal)|People's Monarchist Party]] (PPM) are also represented in the local parliament. Currently, {{as of|2008|alt=as of the 2008 Regional Elections}}, the Socialist Party (PS) and its leader, [[Carlos C\u00e9sar]] have a plurality of the seats in the Assembly, and operate the Regional Government. Although the PS dominates the regional politics, the PSD is traditionally popular in city and [[town council]] elections.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Aviation===\n{{main|Aviation in the Azores}}\nEach of the nine islands has an airfield,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flugplaetze.org/PT/ |title=Flugh\u00e4fen in Portugal (PT) |publisher=Flugplaetze.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}</ref> although the majority are airfields rather than airports.

dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]], in [[Ponta Delgada, Azores|Ponta Delgada]], [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island]].]]\n\nAzoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental Portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.\n\nReligious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the Azorean calendar. The most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the [[cult of the Holy Spirit]], commonly referred to as the festivals of the Holy Spirit (or ''Esp\u00edrito Santo''), rooted in millenarian dogma and held on all islands from May to September. These festivals are very important to the Azorean people, who are primarily Roman Catholic, and combine religious rituals with processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. These events are centred around ''treatros'' or ''imp\u00e9rios'', small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. On Terceira, for example, these imp\u00e9rios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. The events focus on the members of local parishes, not tourists, but all are welcome, as sharing is one of the main principles of the festivals. Some limited events focus on tourists, including a public event that the city government of Ponta Delgada on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel holds, which attracts visitors and locals.\n\n[[File:SMG PDL 20090517 SaoJose festaSSCristo imageLights02.jpg|thumb|left|The solemn procession of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]].]]\nAnother event, the Festival of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]] (or ''Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres'') in [[Ponta Delgada]] on the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], is the largest individual religious event in the Azores, and takes place on [[Rogation Sunday]]. Pilgrims from within the Portuguese diaspora normally travel to Ponta Delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of Christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. Although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo occur over a period of a week and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the Azores and to the Portuguese diaspora.\nThe Sanjoaninas Festivities in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] on Terceira are held in June honoring [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]], in a large religious celebration.\n[[File:Santuario de Senhor Santo Cristo (4616740146).jpg|thumb|The illuminated Convent and Shrine of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]].]]\n\nThe festival of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] (or ''Nossa Senhora de Lourdes''), [[patron saint]] of whalers, begins in Lajes on [[Pico Island]] on the last Sunday of August and runs through the week\u2014Whalers Week. It is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of [[Whaling|whale hunting]]. The Wine [[Harvest festival|Harvest Festival]] (or ''Festa das Vindimas''), takes place during the first week of September and is a century-old custom of the people of Pico.\n\nOn Corvo the people celebrate their patron saint Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Our Lady of Miracles) on 15 August every year in addition to the festivals of the Divine Holy Spirit. The Festival da Mar\u00e9 de Agosto (August Sea Festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 August in Praia Formosa on Santa Maria. Also, the Semana do Mar (Sea Week), dedicated almost exclusively to [[Watersport|water sports]], takes place in August in the city of Horta, on Faial.\n\n[[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also celebrated in the Azores. Parades and pageants are the heart of the Carnaval festivities. There is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats.\nThe traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing as is the running of bulls in the streets.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Azores}}\n*[[Berlengas]]\n*[[Queijo do Pico|Cheese of Pico]] (PDO)\n*[[List of islands of Portugal]]\n*[[Macaronesia]]\n*[[Madeira]]\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Azores]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book|last=Costa|first=Antonieta|title=Pelo sinal do Esp\u00edrito Santo By the sign of the Holy Spirit|year=2007|publisher=Presid\u00eancia do Governo Reginal dos A\u00e7ores.

Many Indigenous Australians retain strong physical and cultural links to their traditional country and are legally recognised as the Traditional Owners of large parts of the Outback under Commonwealth [[Native title in Australia|Native Title]] legislation.\n\nEarly European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic. More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas. The first party to successfully cross the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] just outside Sydney was led by [[Gregory Blaxland]] in 1813, 25 years after the colony was established. People starting with [[John Oxley]] in 1817, 1818 and 1821, followed by [[Charles Sturt]] in 1829\u20131830 attempted to follow the westward-flowing rivers to find an \"inland sea\", but these were found to all flow into the [[Murray River]] and [[Darling River]] which turn south.\nOver the period 1858 to 1861, [[John McDouall Stuart]] led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning, without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. This contrasts with the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] in 1860\u201361 which was much better funded, but resulted in the deaths of three of the members of the transcontinental party.\n\nThe [[Overland Telegraph]] line was constructed in the 1870s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/overland-telegraph |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629144111/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/overland-telegraph |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> along the route identified by Stuart.\n\nIn 1865 the surveyor [[George Goyder]], using changes in vegetation patterns, mapped a [[Goyder's Line|line in South Australia]], north of which he considered rainfall to be too unreliable to support agriculture.\n\nExploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when [[Len Beadell]] explored, surveyed and built many roads in support of the [[Nuclear weapons tests in Australia|nuclear weapons tests]] at [[Emu Field]] and [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]] and rocket testing on the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]].

Many animals, such as [[red kangaroo]]s and [[dingo]]es, hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.\n\nBirdlife is prolific, most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk.  Huge flocks of [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[Corella (bird)|corellas]] and [[galah]]s are often sighted. On bare ground or roads during the winter, various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun, but they are rarely seen during the summer months.\n\nFeral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia, brought to Australia by pastoralists and explorers, along with the early [[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan drivers]]. Feral horses known as '[[brumby|brumbies]]' are station horses that have run wild.  Feral pigs, foxes, cats and rabbits are other imported animals also degrading the environment, so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelands.\n\nThe Outback is home to a diverse set of animal species, such as the kangaroo, emu and dingo.

The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing, on cattle stations which are leased from the Federal Government. While small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols.\n\n[[Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh)|Riversleigh]], in Queensland, is one of Australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a World Heritage site in 1994. The 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (39 sq mi) area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] age.\n\n== Industry ==\n\n=== Pastoralism ===\n[[File:ISS007 Gosses Bluff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gosses Bluff crater]], one of a number of [[meteor]] [[impact crater]]s that can be found across outback Australia]]\nThe largest industry across the Outback, in terms of the area occupied, is [[pastoralism]], in which cattle, sheep, and sometimes goats, are grazed in mostly intact, natural ecosystems. Widespread use of bore water, obtained from underground aquifers, including the [[Great Artesian Basin]], has enabled livestock to be grazed across vast areas in which no permanent surface water exists naturally.\n\nCapitalising on the lack of pasture improvement and absence of fertiliser and pesticide use, many Outback pastoral properties are certified as [[Organic farming|organic]] livestock producers. In 2014, {{convert|17000000|ha}}, most of which is in Outback Australia, was fully certified as organic farm production, making Australia the largest certified organic production area in the world.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\n\"Nothing says Australia quite like our Outback,\" states the national tourism web site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australia.com/en/things-to-do/outback-australia.html|title=The Outback \u2013 Tourism Australia|last=Australia|first=Tourism|date=2016-11-01|website=www.australia.com|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210173849/http://www.australia.com/en/things-to-do/outback-australia.html|archivedate=10 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Tourism is a major industry across the Outback, and commonwealth and state tourism agencies explicitly target Outback Australia as a desirable destination for domestic and international travellers.

Owing to the almost complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the [[Permian]] (in many areas since the [[Cambrian]]) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, [[manganese]] and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, copper, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. Major mines and mining areas in the Outback include opals at [[Coober Pedy, South Australia|Coober Pedy]], [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]] and [[White Cliffs, New South Wales|White Cliffs]], metals at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], [[Tennant Creek, Northern Territory|Tennant Creek]], [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] and the remote [[Challenger Mine]]. Oil and gas are extracted in the [[Cooper Basin]] around [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]].\n\nIn Western Australia the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply.

In former times, serious injuries or illnesses often meant death due to the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel.\n\n==Education==\n\n{{Main|School of the Air}}\n\nIn most outback communities, the number of children is too small for a conventional school to operate. Children are educated at home by the [[School of the Air]]. Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio, but now satellite telecommunication is used instead.\nSome children attend boarding school, mostly only those in secondary school.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe concept of 'back' country, which initially meant land beyond the settled regions, was in existence in 1800. Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception. The term \"outback\" was first used in print in 1869, when the writer clearly meant west of [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.<ref name=\"Coupe\">Coupe, Sheena (ed.),  Frontier Country, Vol. 1, Weldon Russell Publishing, Willoughby, 1989, {{ISBN|1-875202-01-3}}</ref>\n\nIt is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located \"beyond the [[Black Stump]]\". The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. It has been suggested that the term comes from the ''Black Stump Wine Saloon'' that once stood about {{convert|10|km}} out of [[Coolah, New South Wales]] on the Gunnedah Road. It is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.<ref name=\"SMHOutback2005\">{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Daniel | authorlink =  | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | title = Outer limits | work = Travel | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2005-05-17 | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426230617/http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | archivedate = 26 April 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n\"The [[Never Never (Australian outback)|Never-Never]]\" is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The Outback can also be referred to as \"back of beyond\", \"back o' [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]]\" although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. The well-watered north of the continent is often called the \"[[Top End]]\" and the arid interior \"The Red Centre\", owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscape.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Gibb River Rd-1.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign warning of potentially dangerous conditions ahead]]\nThe outback is criss-crossed by historic tracks. Most of the major highways have an excellent [[bitumen]] surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads.  Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and spare fuel, tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken.  Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious \u2013 it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray onto roads.  Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season (November to April), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. In addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as [[Road Train]]s) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by over 46 tyres.\n\nThe [[Stuart Highway]] runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the [[Adelaide\u2013Darwin railway]]. There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the south-west to the north-east to create an all-weather road named the [[Outback Highway]], crossing the continent diagonally from [[Laverton, Western Australia]] (north of [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], through the Northern Territory to [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]], in Queensland.\n\nAir transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures.  Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a [[fly-in fly-out]] workforce. Most outback [[sheep station]]s and [[cattle station]]s have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane. Medical and ambulance services are provided by the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]]. The [[School of the Air]] is a radio-based school using the RFDS radios.\n\nVisitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles, or take organised tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning.  However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a [[four-wheel drive]]). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, EPIRB etc.).  Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help.  Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search, than a person, so in the event of a breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Birdsville Track]]\n* [[Burke Developmental Road]]\n* [[Canning Stock Route]]\n* [[Colson Track]]\n* [[Connie Sue Highway]]\n* [[Simpson Desert|French Line]]\n* [[Gary Highway]]\n* [[Gibb River Road]]\n* [[Great Central Road]]\n* [[Gunbarrel Highway]]\n* [[K1 Line]]\n* [[Kalumburu Road]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Kidman Way]]\n* [[Kidson Track]]\n* [[Lasseter Highway]]\n* [[Oodnadatta Track]]\n* [[Peninsula Developmental Road]]\n* [[Plenty Highway]]\n* [[Rig Road]]\n* [[Sandover Highway]]\n* [[Strzelecki Track]]\n* [[Talawana Track]]\n* [[Tanami Track]]\n* [[WAA Line]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n*[[Australian landmarks]]\n*[[Central Australia]]\n*[[Channel Country]]\n*[[Australian outback literature of the 20th century]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dwyer, Andrew (2007).

[\u03c9<sub>0</sub>+1 should be \u03c9<sub>0</sub>.])<br />\n<br />\nNow ''\u03a9&prime;'' (and therefore also ''\u03a9'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''\u03a9&prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''\u03b4'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''\u03a9''; the number ''\u03b4'', however, also belongs to the system ''\u03a9'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''\u03b4'' would be greater than ''\u03b4'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:<br />\n<br />\n''The system \u03a9 of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}\n\n== The Burali-Forti paradox ==\n{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}\nThe idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's \"paradox\"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.\n\nMore generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.\n\nA standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.\n\nWhile this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly \"large\") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Actual infinity]]\n* [[Limitation of size]]\n* [[Monadology]]\n* [[Reflection principle]]\n* [[The Ultimate (philosophy)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m70382468x5h5205/fulltext.pdf ''The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set'']\n* ''Infinity and the Mind'', [[Rudy Rucker]], Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-691-00172-3}}; orig. pub.

The purpose of conducting acceptance testing is that once completed, and provided the acceptance criteria are met, it is expected the sponsors will sign-off on the product development/enhancement as satisfying the defined requirements (previously agreed between business and product provider/developer).\n\n== User acceptance testing ==\n\nUser acceptance testing (UAT) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user.<ref>{{cite book|last= Cimperman|first= Rob|title= UAT Defined: A Guide to Practical User Acceptance Testing|year= 2006|publisher= Pearson Education|isbn= 9780132702621|pages=Chapter 2}}</ref> It is not [[system testing]] (ensuring software does not crash and meets documented requirements), but rather ensures that the solution will work for the user (i.e., tests that the user accepts the solution); software vendors often refer to this as \"Beta testing\".\n\nThis testing should be undertaken by a [[subject-matter expert]] (SME), preferably the owner or client of the solution under test, and provide a summary of the findings for confirmation to proceed after trial or review. In [[Software development process|software development]], UAT as one of the final stages of a project often occurs before a client or customer accepts the new system. Users of the system perform tests in line with what would occur in real-life scenarios.<ref>{{cite book|last= Goethem|first= Brian Hambling, Pauline van|title= User acceptance testing : a step-by-step guide|year= 2013|publisher= BCS Learning & Development Limited|isbn= 9781780171678}}</ref>\n\nIt is important that the materials given to the tester be similar to the materials that the end user will have. Testers should be given real-life scenarios such as the three most common or difficult tasks that the users they represent will undertake.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe UAT acts as a final verification of the required business functionality and proper functioning of the system, emulating real-world conditions on behalf of the paying client or a specific large customer. If the software works as required and without issues during normal use, one can reasonably extrapolate the same level of stability in production.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pusuluri|first=Nageshwar Rao|title=Software Testing Concepts And Tools|year=2006|publisher=Dreamtech Press|isbn=9788177227123|page=62}}</ref>\n\nUser tests, usually performed by clients or by end-users, do not normally focus on identifying simple cosmetic problems such as spelling errors, nor on [[Software bug|showstopper]] defects, such as [[crash (computing)|software crashes]]; testers and developers identify and fix these issues during earlier [[unit testing]], [[integration testing]], and system testing phases.\n\nUAT should be executed against test scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Test scenarios usually differ from System or Functional test cases in that they represent a \"player\" or \"user\" journey. The broad nature of the test scenario ensures that the focus is on the journey and not on technical or system-specific details, staying away from \"click-by-click\" test steps to allow for a variance in users' behaviour. Test scenarios can be broken down into logical \"days\", which are usually where the actor (player/customer/operator) or system (backoffice, front end) changes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn industry, a common UAT is a factory acceptance test (FAT). This test takes place before installation of the equipment. Most of the time testers not only check that the equipment meets the specification, but also that it is fully functional. A FAT usually includes a check of completeness, a verification against contractual requirements, a proof of functionality (either by simulation or a conventional function test) and a final inspection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/materials_testing_and_inspection/supply_chain_services/factory_acceptance_test/factory_acceptance_test.jsp |title=Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) |publisher=Tuv.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inspection-for-industry.com/factory-acceptance-test.html |title=Factory Acceptance Test |publisher=Inspection-for-industry.com |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these tests give clients confidence in how the system will perform in production. There may also be legal or contractual requirements for acceptance of the system.\n\n== Operational acceptance testing ==\n[[Operational acceptance testing]] (OAT) is used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service or system as part of a [[quality management system]]. OAT is a common type of non-functional [[software testing]], used mainly in [[software development]] and [[software maintenance]] projects. This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment.\n\n== Acceptance testing in extreme programming ==\n\nAcceptance testing is a term used in [[agile software development]] methodologies, particularly [[extreme programming]], referring to the [[functional testing]] of a [[user story]] by the software development team during the implementation phase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to Acceptance/Customer Tests as Requirements Artifacts|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/acceptanceTests.htm|work=agilemodeling.com|publisher=Agile Modeling|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe customer specifies scenarios to test when a user story has been correctly implemented. A story can have one or many acceptance tests, whatever it takes to ensure the functionality works. Acceptance tests are black-box system tests. Each acceptance test represents some expected result from the system. Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the acceptance tests and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. Acceptance tests are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its acceptance tests. This means that new acceptance tests must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.<ref>{{cite web|author=Don Wells |url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/functionaltests.html |title=Acceptance Tests |publisher=Extremeprogramming.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n== Types of acceptance testing ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\nTypical types of acceptance testing include the following\n\n; [[Verification and validation#Activities|User acceptance testing]]:\n: This may include factory acceptance testing (FAT), i.e. the testing done by a vendor before the product or system is moved to its destination site, after which site acceptance testing (SAT) may be performed by the users at the site.<ref>{{cite news |last=Prasad |first=Durga |url=http://www.kneat.com/2012/03/29/the-difference-between-a-fat-and-a-sat/ |title=The Difference Between a FAT and a SAT |work=Kneat.com |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2016-07-27 }}</ref>\n; [[Operational acceptance testing]]:Also known as operational readiness testing, this refers to the checking done to a system to ensure that processes and procedures are in place to allow the system to be used and maintained. This may include checks done to back-up facilities, procedures for disaster recovery, training for end users, maintenance procedures, and security procedures.\n; Contract and regulation acceptance testing\n: In contract acceptance testing, a system is tested against acceptance criteria as documented in a contract, before the system is accepted. In regulation acceptance testing, a system is tested to ensure it meets governmental, legal and safety standards.\n; Alpha and beta testing\n: Alpha testing takes place at developers' sites, and involves testing of the operational system by internal staff, before it is released to external customers. Beta testing takes place at customers' sites, and involves testing by a group of customers who use the system at their own locations and provide feedback, before the system is released to other customers. The latter is often called \"field testing\".\n\n== List of acceptance-testing frameworks ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n* [[Concordion]], [[Specification by example]] (SbE) framework\n** Concordion.NET, acceptance testing in .NET\n* [[Cucumber (software)|Cucumber]], a [[behavior-driven development]] (BDD) acceptance test framework\n** Capybara, Acceptance test framework for Ruby web applications\n** Behat, BDD acceptance framework for PHP\n** Lettuce, BDD acceptance framework for Python\n* [[Fabasoft app.test]] for automated acceptance tests\n* [[Framework for Integrated Test]] (Fit)\n** [[FitNesse]], a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Fit\n* [[iMacros]]\n* [[ItsNat]] Java Ajax web framework with built-in, server based, functional web testing capabilities.\n* [[Mocha (JavaScript framework)|Mocha]], a popular web acceptance test framework based on Javascript and Node.js\n* [[Ranorex]]\n* [[Robot Framework]]\n* [[Selenium (software)|Selenium]]\n* [[Specification by example]] (Specs2)\n* [[Watir]]\n* [[Gauge (software)]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Software Testing}}\n\n* [[Acceptance sampling]]\n* [[Conference room pilot]]\n* [[Development stage]]\n* [[Dynamic testing]]\n* [[Engineering validation test]]\n* [[Grey box testing]]\n* [[Test-driven development]]\n* [[White box testing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{Cite book | title=User Acceptance Testing: A Step by Step Guide | publisher=BCS Learning and Development Ltd | last1 = Hambling | first1 = Brian | last2 = van Goethem | first2 =  Pauline | year=2013 | location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-78017-167-8 }}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* ''[http://testingguidance.codeplex.com Acceptance Test Engineering Guide]'' by [http://msdn.com/practices Microsoft patterns & practices]\n* \"[http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=23 Using Customer Tests to Drive Development]\" from ''[http://www.methodsandtools.com/ Methods & Tools]''\n* \"[http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=72 Acceptance TDD Explained]\" from ''[http://www.methodsandtools.com/ Methods & Tools]''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Acceptance Testing}}\n\n[[Category:Software testing]]\n[[Category:Hardware testing]]\n[[Category:Procurement]]", "sha1": "o27youjvof60qjs3y1wmqso7hrqhdy5"}}, {"title": "Archbishopric of Riga", "ns": "0", "id": "3234", "revision": {"id": "864943138", "parentid": "856115640", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T16:39:01Z", "contributor": {"ip": "108.184.93.235"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{distinguish|text=the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia#Archbishop of Riga|Lutheran Archbishop of Riga]] or the current [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Riga]]}}\n{{Infobox Former Country\n|native_name= ''Archiepiscopatus Rigensis'' <small>([[Latin|la]])</small><br />''Erzbisdom Riga'' <small>([[Low German|nds]])</small>\n|conventional_long_name= Archbishopric of Riga\n|common_name = Riga\n|continent= Europe\n|status = [[Prince-Bishop]]ric of [[Terra Mariana]] \n|era=Middle Ages\n|p1= Ancient Estonia\n|image_p1= [[File:Coats of arms of None.svg|20px|alt=|link=]]\n|p2= Principality of Jersika\n|image_p2= [[File:Coats of arms of None.svg|20px|alt=|link=]]\n|p3= Principality of Koknese\n|image_p3= [[File:LVA Kokneses pagasts COA.png|20px|alt=|link=]]\n|p4= T\u0101lava\n|image_p4= [[File:Coats of arms of None.svg|20px|alt=|link=]]\n|s1= Duchy of Livonia\n|flag_s1= Alex K Kingdom of Poland-flag.svg\n|border_s1= no\n|year_start= 1186\n|date_start= \n|event_start= \n|year_end= 1561\n|date_end= \n|event_end= \n|event1= \n|date_event1= \n|title_leader= Archbishop of Riga\n|leader1= [[Albert Suerbeer]] (first)\n|year_leader1 = 1245\u201373\n|leader2= [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] (last)\n|year_leader2 = 1539\u201363\n|image_flag= \n|image_coat  = Archbishopric of Riga.svg \n|symbol_type  = Seal\n|image_map = Medieval Livonia 1260.svg\n|image_map_caption = Archbishopric of Riga (in yellow), shown within [[Terra Mariana]]\n|government_type= Theocracy\n|legislature = \n|common_languages= [[Latin]]<br/>[[Low German]]<br/>[[Livonian language|Livonian]]<br />[[Latvian language|Latvian]]\n|capital= Riga\n|currency= Livonian [[Penny]]<br />Livonian [[Austrian schilling|Schilling]]\n}}\n{{History of Latvia}}\nThe '''Archbishopric of Riga''' ({{lang-la|Archiepiscopatus Rigensis}}, {{lang-nds|Erzbisdom Riga}}) was an [[archbishop]]ric in [[Terra Mariana|Medieval Livonia]], a subject to the [[Holy See]].

During the 1573 Polish election, Albert Frederick attempted to gain acceptance to the Polish [[senate]] but was opposed by the powerful [[Jan Zamoyski]] (later Grand [[Hetman]] of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]) who feared the influence of [[Protestants]] in the Polish legislative body. Albert Frederick initially refused to recognize the election of [[Stefan Bathory]] and supported the candidacy of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]]. However, at the [[Toru\u0144]] [[sejm]] of October 1576 he gave his support to the new monarch.\n\nAs the great grandson of the Polish king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], and as a Duke in Prussia who was fluent in Polish, Albert Frederick was seriously considered for a time as a possible candidate for the Polish throne. He particularly enjoyed the support of Polish [[Lutherans]].\n\nIn 1572 he began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. In early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George Frederick of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (1539\u20131603). After George Frederick's death in 1603, the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] appointed [[Joachim III Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim Frederick]] as regent in 1605, and permitted his son, [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]], to succeed him in 1611.

It is the capital of the [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Mittelfranken|Middle Franconia]]. Ansbach is {{convert|25|mi|sp=us}} southwest of [[Nuremberg]] and {{convert|90|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Munich]], on the [[Fr\u00e4nkische Rezat]] (Rezat River), a tributary of the [[Main (river)|Main]] river. In 2004, its population was 40,723.\n\nDeveloped in the 8th century as a [[Benedictine monastery]], it became the seat of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] family in 1331. In 1460, the Margraves of [[F\u00fcrst und Markgraf von Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] lived here. The city has a castle known as [[Markgrafenschlo\u00df|Margrafen\u2013Schloss]], built between 1704\u20131738. It was not badly damaged during the [[World Wars]] and hence retains its original historical baroque sheen.  Ansbach is now home to a US military base and to the [[Ansbach University of Applied Sciences]].\n\nThe city has connections via autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A6]] and highways [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 13|B13]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 14|B14]]. [[Ansbach station]] is on the [[Nuremberg\u2013Crailsheim railway|N\u00fcrnberg\u2013Crailsheim]] and [[Treuchtlingen\u2013W\u00fcrzburg railway|Treuchtlingen\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]] railways and is the terminus of line S4 of the [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]].\n\n==Name origin==\n'''Ansbach''' was originally called '''Onoltesbach''' (about 790 AD), a term composed of three parts.\n\nThe individual word elements are \"Onold\" (the city founder's name), the [[Suffix]] \"-es\" (a possessive ending, like \"-'s\" in English) and the [[Old High German]] expression \"pah\" or \"bach\" (for [[Stream|brook]]). The name of the city has slightly changed throughout the centuries into '''Onoltespah''' (837 AD), '''Onoldesbach''' (1141 AD), '''Onoldsbach''' (1230 AD), '''Onelspach''' (1338 AD), '''Onsbach''' (1508 AD) and finally '''Ansbach''' (1732 AD).<ref>Wolf-Armin von Reitzenstein: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CBTv-Jl3DkYC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false Lexikon fr\u00e4nkischer Ortsnamen]'' (eng: \"Lexicon to franconian toponymy\"), [[Verlag C.

Their leader Onold led them to an area called the \"Rezattal\" (Rezat valley). This is where they founded the \"Urh\u00f6fe\" (meaning the first farms: Knollenhof, Voggenhof and Rabenhof). Gradually more settlers, such as the \"Winden-Tribe\" came, and the farms grew into a small village. Many villages around Ansbach were founded by the \"Winden\" during that period (even today their settlements can easily identified by their names, like \"Meinhardsz'''winden'''\", \"Dauten'''winden'''\" or \"Brods'''winden'''\" for example).\nA [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine monastery]] was established there around 748 by the [[Franks|Frankish]] noble [[Gumbertus|St&nbsp;Gumbertus]]. The adjoining village of Onoltesbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.<ref>Werner B\u00fcrger: ''Heimatgeschichte der Stadt Ansbach'' (eng: \"The history of Ansbach\"), Oldenburg Verlag, [[Munich]] 1990, (in German)</ref>\n\nThe counts of [[County of \u00d6ttingen|\u00d6ttingen]] ruled over Ansbach until the [[Hohenzollern]] burgrave of [[Burgraviate of N\u00fcrnberg|N\u00fcrnberg]] took over in 1331. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1415. After the 1440 death of [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick&nbsp;I]], a cadet branch of the family established itself as the [[Brandenburg-Ansbach|margraves of Ansbach]]. [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George the Pious]] introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]] to Ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of [[St. Gumbertus, Ansbach|Gumbertus Abbey]] in 1563.\n\nThe [[Markgrafenschlo\u00df]] was built between 1704\u20131738.<ref name=\"Spaltro2005\">{{cite book|last1= Spaltro |first1= Kathleen |last2= Bridge |first2= Noeline |display-authors=1 |title= Royals of England: A Guide for Readers, Travelers, and Genealogists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUOzgLiyd54C&pg=PA262 |accessdate=16 September 2012 |year=2005 |publisher= iUniverse |isbn=9780595373123 |page=262}}</ref> Its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In 1796, the Duke of [[Duchy of Zweibr\u00fccken|Zweibr\u00fccken]], [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]] \u2014 the future Bavarian king Max I Joseph \u2014 was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibr\u00fccken had been taken by the French.

They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi regime in the [[Kristallnacht]]. It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a \"Symbolic House of God\". A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=German Wikipedia is not a reliable source}} In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach [''Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic''] to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the [[Action T4]] euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way.

Fini was succeeded by [[Ignazio La Russa]], who managed the merger of the party with [[Forza Italia]] (FI) into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) in 2009. A group of former AN members, led by La Russa, left FI in 2012 in order to launch the [[Brothers of Italy]] (FdI), while others remained in the PdL and were among the founding members of the new [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] (FI) in 2013.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nNational Alliance, launched in 1994, was officially founded in January 1995, when the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), the former [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] party, merged with conservative elements of the former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to [[Political corruption|corruption]] at its highest levels, exposed by the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' investigation, and the [[Italian Liberal Party]], disbanded in the same year. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party and former MSI leader [[Gianfranco Fini]] was elected leader of the new party.\n\nThe AN logo followed a template very similar to that of the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], with the logo of the direct predecessor party in a small circle, as a means of legally preventing others from using it. The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper ''[[Il Tempo (newspaper)|Il Tempo]]'' written in 1992 by [[Domenico Fisichella]], a prominent conservative academic. Starting in the 1990s, the MSI gradually transformed into a mainstream [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into AN.\n\n===Government participation===\n[[File:Gianfranco Fini 2004.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Gianfranco Fini]] in 2004.]]\nThe party was part of all three [[House of Freedoms]] coalition governments led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Gianfranco Fini was notably nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 general election]] and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006.\n\nWhen Gianfranco Fini visited [[Israel]] in late November 2003 in the function of Italian Deputy Prime Minister, he labeled the racial laws issued by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] regime in 1938 as \"infamous\", as also [[Giorgio Almirante]], historic leader of MSI, had done before.<ref>[http://www.ildomenicale.it/approfondimento.asp?id_approfondimento=16 Il Domenicale<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He also referred to the [[Italian Social Republic]] as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of \"absolute evil\", something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. As a result, [[Alessandra Mussolini]], the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed [[Social Action]].<ref name=\"Bardi\"/><ref name=\"Ignazi\">Piero Ignazi, ''Partiti politici in Italia'', Il Mulino, Bologna 2008, pp. 27-31.</ref>\n\nIn occasion of the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], AN ran within the House of Freedoms, with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]]. Individually AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007 a group of splinters led by [[Francesco Storace]] formed [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]], which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including [[Teodoro Buontempo]] and [[Daniela Santanch\u00e8]], joined the new party.\n\n===The People of Freedom===\nIn November 2007 [[Silvio Berlusconi]] announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party.<ref>[http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 Sky tg24 - Tutte le notizie in formato video<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615195058/http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 |date=15 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml \u00abOggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano\u00bb.

Moreover, AN presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, [[nation|national identity]] and [[patriotism]].\n\nRegarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of [[presidential democracy|presidentialism]] and a [[plurality voting system]], and came to support also [[federalism]] and to fully accept the alliance with [[Lega Nord]], although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity.\n\n[[Gianfranco Fini]], a moderniser who saw [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[David Cameron]] as role-models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values and patriotism with a progressive approach in other areas such as [[stem cell]] research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. Some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and [[artificial insemination]].<ref name=\"Ignazi\"/>\n\n==Factions==\nNational Alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organized:\n*'''[[Protagonist Right]]''' (''Destra Protagonista''), headed by [[Maurizio Gasparri]] and [[Ignazio La Russa]], was the bigger faction and the closest to [[Forza Italia]], due to its [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] stances.\n*'''[[New Alliance (Italy)|New Alliance]]''' (''Nuova Alleanza''), formerly called '''Right and Freedom''' (''Destra e Libert\u00e0''), headed by [[Altero Matteoli]] and [[Adolfo Urso]], was formed by the staunchest supporters of [[Gianfranco Fini]] within the party and supported a [[Liberalism|liberal]] political agenda.\n*'''[[Social Right]]''' (''Destra Sociale''), led by [[Gianni Alemanno]], advocated a more \"social\" approach to economic policy and was considered at the right of the party. It had close ties with the [[General Labour Union (Italy)|General Labour Union]].\n*'''''D-Destra''''', led by [[Francesco Storace]], was the most conservative component of the party, proud of the MSI's tradition and in open opposition to Fini. Formed as a split from the Social Right, in July 2007 the group finally left AN and launched [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]].\n*'''[[Christian Reformists]]''' (''Cristiano Riformisti'') was a minor [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] faction.\n\nIn the party there was also a group named '''Ethic-Religious Council''', whose board members included [[Gaetano Rebecchini]] (founder, ex-DC), [[Riccardo Pedrizzi]] (president), [[Franco Tofoni]] (vice president), [[Luigi Gagliardi]] (secretary-general), [[Alfredo Mantovano]], [[Antonio Mazzocchi]] and [[Riccardo Migliori]]. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticized [[Gianfranco Fini]] for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-DC members as [[Publio Fiori]] to leave the party. Some members of the Council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano were described as members of an unofficial '''Catholic Right''' faction.\n\n== Popular support ==\nThe party had roughly 10\u201315% support across Italy, having its strongholds in [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]] ([[Lazio]] 18.6%, [[Umbria]] 15.2%, [[Marche]] 14.3%, [[Abruzzo]] 14.3%, [[Apulia]] 13.2%, [[Sardinia]] 12.9%, [[Tuscany]] 12.6% and [[Campania]] 12.6% in the last [[Italian general election, 2006|general election]]), scoring badly in [[Lombardy]] (10.2%) and [[Sicily]] (10.9%), while competing in the North-East ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] 15.5% and [[Veneto]] 11.3%).\n\nThe party had a good showing in the first general election to which it took part (13.5% in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]]) and reached 15.7% in [[Italian general election, 1996|1996]], when Fini tried for the first time to replace [[Silvio Berlusconi]] as leader of the centre-right. From that moment the party suffered an electoral decline, but remained the third force of Italian politics.\n\nIn the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], the final election to which the party participated with its own list, AN won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate.

Photographed in Via delle Casine.]] \nThe river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].\n\nWith a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] at {{convert|60|km|mi}} long, [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] at {{convert|49|km}}, and the [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]], and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following subbasins:\n\n*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.\n*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.\n*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered on the east by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and on the west by the hills around [[Siena]].\n*The Sieve's basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.\n*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]], and [[Pistoia]].\n*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from about {{convert|6|m3/s|cuft/s}} to more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|cuft/s}}. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]] but is now several kilometres westwards.\n\nIt crosses [[Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trinita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in [[1966 flood of the Arno|1966]], with {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}} after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.\n\nBefore Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the [[Lago di Bientina]], which was once the largest lake in [[Tuscany]] before its reclamation. \n\nThe flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between {{convert|0.56|and|3540|m3/s|cuft/s}}. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.\n\nThe [[1966 flood of the Arno|flood on November 4, 1966]] collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.  New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Alison McLean |date=November 2006 | title = This Month in History | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 34 }}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nFrom Latin ''Arnus'' (Pliny, ''Natural History'' 3.50).

Duarte]] conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the ''Feira de Mar\u00e7o'' (''March Fair''), today still an annual tradition.\n\nThe Princess [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 May 1490. During her life her presence brought attention to the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.\n\nThe first charter ([[foral]]) was conceded by [[Manuel I of Portugal]] on 4 August 1515, as indicated in the ''Livro de Leituras Novas de Forais da Estremadura''. Its geographic position along the Aveiro River had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development.\nBy the beginning of the 15th century, there already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population.<ref name=Historia/> This included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway.<ref name=Historia/> In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in [[metal]]s and [[tile]]s, and creating a reef barrier at the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.\n\nBetween the 16th and 17th centuries, the river's instability at the mouth (between the Ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of Aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. This blow to the economy created a social and economic crisis, and resulted in the decrease in the population and emigration. It was at this time that the Church of the Miser\u00edcordia was constructed, during the Philippine Dynastic union.\n\nIn 1759, King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jos\u00e9 I]] elevated the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the Duke of Aveiro (a title established in 1547 by [[John III of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o III]]), Jos\u00e9 Mascarenhas, to death. As a result, Aveiro became known as '''Nova Bragan\u00e7a''': it was later abandoned much later, and returned to Aveiro. In 1774, by request of King Jos\u00e9, [[Pope Clement XIV]] instituted the [[Diocese of Aveiro]].\n\nIn the 19th century, the Aveirense were active during the [[Liberal Wars]], and it was Jos\u00e9 Est\u00eav\u00e3o Coelho de Magalh\u00e3es, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the Ria, and development of transport, especially the railway line between Lisbon and Porto. It was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed Aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.<ref name=Historia/>\n\nThe municipality was elevated to the status of town, centered on the its principal church, consecrated to the Archangel Michael, today the location of the ''Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica'' (having been demolished in 1835).\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aveiro bridge over canal.jpg|thumb|Bridge over canal in Aveiro]]\nLocated on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Aveiro is an industrial city with an important [[seaport]].\n\nThe seat of the municipality is the city of Aveiro, comprising the five urban parishes with about 73,003 inhabitants. The city of Aveiro is also the capital of the District of [[Aveiro (district)|Aveiro]], and the largest city in the [[Baixo Vouga]] intermunicipal community subregion.\n\nAveiro is known as \"The Portuguese [[Venice]]\", due to its system of canals and boats similar to the Italian city of Venice.

The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the ''Museu de Santa Joana'', or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.\n\nThe abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime.<ref name=Historia/>  The best of these in the university campus, where many the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.<ref name=Historia/>\n\nThere are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beache, including the ''\u00cdlhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre'' and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and [[Gafanha da Nazar\u00e9]].\n\n==Culture==\nAveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, ''[[Ovos Moles de Aveiro]]'' ([[Protected Geographical Indication|PGI]]),<ref name=\"CR943\">{{cite web|title=Commission Regulation (EC) N.\u00ba 510/2006|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:184:0042:0045:EN:PDF|author=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=22 July 2008|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|location=Brussels, Belgium}}</ref> ''trouxas de ovos'', both made from eggs.

Shortly thereafter, he decided to follow the [[Evangelical counsels|Evangelical counsel]] of [[Jesus]] which reads, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven.\"{{bibleref2c|Mt|19:21}} Anthony gave away some of his family's lands to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds thus raised to the poor.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} He then left to live an [[asceticism|ascetic]] life,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} placing his sister with a group of [[Consecrated virgin|Christian virgins]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Athanasius|title=Life of Antony|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-8146-2377-8|others=Carolinne White, trans|volume=3|page=10}}</ref> a sort of proto-convent.\n\n=== Hermit ===\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo 025.jpg|thumb|261px|Painting of Saint Anthony, a part of ''The Visitation with [[Saint Nicholas]] and Saint Anthony Abbot'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], {{c.|lk=no|1480}}]]\nFor the next fifteen years, Anthony remained in the area,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} spending the first years as the disciple of another local [[hermit]].<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> There are various legends associating Anthony with pigs: one is that he worked as a [[swineherd]] during this period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sax|first=Boria|title=How Saint Anthony Brought Fire to the World|url=http://www.h-net.org/~nilas/seasons/stanthony.html|accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\nAnthony is sometimes considered the first monk,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}  and the first to initiate solitary desertification,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxthought.sovietpedia.com/2017/03/a-few-words-about-life-and-writings-of.html|title=A few words about the life and writings of St. Anthony the Great|website=orthodoxthought.sovietpedia.com|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref> but there were others before him. There were already [[asceticism|ascetic]] [[ancient Greek religion|pagan]] [[hermit]]s (the ''[[Therapeutae]]''), and loosely organized [[cenobitic]] communities were described by the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] [[Philo of Alexandria]] in the 1st century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}} as long established in the harsh environment of [[Lake Mareotis]] and in other less accessible regions. Philo opined that \"this class of persons may be met with in many places, for both Greece and barbarian countries want to enjoy whatever is perfectly good.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Philo|title=De Vita Contemplativa|trans-title={{lang-en|The Contemplative Life}} |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html }}.</ref> Christian ascetics such as [[Thecla]] had likewise retreated to isolated locations at the outskirts of cities. Anthony is notable for having decided to surpass this tradition and headed out into the desert proper. He left for the alkaline [[Nitrian Desert]] (later the location of the noted monasteries of [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]], and [[Scetis]]) on the edge of the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] about {{convert|95|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} west of [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]]. He remained there for 13 years.<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" />\n\nAccording to [[Athanasius]], the devil fought Anthony by afflicting him with boredom, laziness, and the phantoms of women, which he overcame by the power of prayer, providing a theme for [[Christian art]]. After that, he moved to a tomb, where he resided and closed the door on himself, depending on some local villagers who brought him food. When the devil perceived his ascetic life and his intense worship, he was envious and beat him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. When his friends from the local village came to visit him and found him in this condition, they carried him to a church.\n\nAfter he recovered, he made a second effort and went back into the desert to a father mountain by the [[Nile]] called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite [[Faiyum|Arsinoe]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fort for some 20 years.<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> According to [[Athanasius]], the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, \"If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me.\" At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he would say a few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.\n\nThen one day he emerged from the fort with the help of villagers, who broke down the door. By this time most had expected him to have wasted away or to have gone insane in his solitary confinement. Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to [[Al Fayyum|Fayyum]] and confirmed the brethren there in the [[Christian]] faith before returning to his fort.\n\nAmid the [[Diocletian Persecutions]], Anthony wished to become a [[martyr]] and in 311 went to [[Alexandria]]. He visited those who were imprisoned for the sake of [[Christ]] and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his [[Christianity]] publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be tortured and martyred, but it did not happen.\n\n===Father of Monks===\n[[Image:Antoniusaltaar.jpg|thumb|261px|The former main altar of the hermitage church in [[Warfhuizen]] in the Netherlands with a mural of Anthony the Abbot and a [[reliquary]] with some of his [[relic]]s.

By this time, many more had heard of his sanctity and he had many more visitors than before. He saw these visits as interfering with his worship and went further into the [[Eastern Desert]]. He traveled for three days before reaching a small oasis with a spring and some [[palm tree]]s and chose to settle there. Disciples soon found him out and his number of visitors again continued to grow.\n\nAnthony had not been the first ascetic or hermit, but he may properly be called the \"Father of Monasticism\" in Christianity,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Britannica, Saint Anthony |url=http://global.britannica.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coptic.net/synexarion/anthony.txt|title=Saint Anthony Father of the Monks |publisher=www.coptic.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Catholic Encyclopedia {{ndash}} St. Anthony|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01553d.htm|website=New Advent}}</ref> as he organized his disciples into a worshipful community and inspired similar withdrawn communities throughout Egypt and, following the spread of Athanasius's hagiography, the Greek and Roman world. His follower [[Macarius the Great]] was particularly active in continuing his legacy.\n\nAnthony anticipated the [[Order of St Benedict|rule]] of [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] by about 200 years, engaging himself and his disciples in manual labor. Anthony himself cultivated a garden and wove [[juncus|rush]] mats. He and his disciples were regularly sought for words of enlightenment. These statements were later collected into the book of ''[[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]]''. Anthony himself is said to have spoken to those of a spiritual disposition personally, leaving the task of addressing the more worldly visitors to [[Macarius the Great|Macarius]]. On occasions, he would go to the monastery on the outskirts of the desert by the [[Nile]] to visit the brethren, then return to his inner [[monastery]].\n\nA background story of one of the surviving epistles, directed to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, \"The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what they tell us, and we turn our backs on them.\" Under the persistence of the brethren who told him \"Emperor Constantine loves the church\", he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.\n\nAccording to Athanasius, Saint Anthony heard a voice telling him \"Go out and see.\" He went out and saw an [[angel]] who wore a girdle with a cross, one resembling the holy Eskiem ([[Tonsure]] or [[Schema (Orthodoxy)|Schema]]), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, \"Anthony, do this and you will rest.\" Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that was about to happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, and the end of the age. When [[Macarius the Great|Saint Macarius]] visited Anthony, Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb and foretold him what would happen to him. When the day drew near for the departure of [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul the First Hermit]] in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St Athanasius the Apostolic]], the 20th [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]].\n\nIn 338, he left the desert temporarily to visit Alexandria to help refute the teachings of [[Arius]].<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> Although not particularly learned, Anthony was able to confound the Arians.<ref name=\"Gonz\u00e1lez 1984 141\">{{citation|last=Gonz\u00e1lez|first=Justo |authorlink=Justo Gonz\u00e1lez|title=The Story of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZO-lwEACAAJ|accessdate=18 May 2013|year=1984|publisher=Prince Press|isbn=978-1-56563-522-7|page=141}}</ref>\n\n=== Final days ===\nWhen Saint Anthony felt that the day of his departure had approached, he commanded his disciples to give his staff to [[Macarius of Egypt|Saint Macarius]], and to give one [[Sheepskin (material)|sheepskin]] cloak to [[Saint Athanasius]] and the other sheepskin cloak to [[Saint Serapion of Thmuis|Saint Serapion]], his disciple. He further instructed his disciples to bury his body in an unmarked, secret [[Grave (burial)|grave]].\n\nHe probably spoke only his native language, [[Coptic language|Coptic]],<ref name=\"Gonz\u00e1lez 1984 141\"/> but his sayings were spread in a [[Greek language|Greek]] translation. He himself wrote letters in Coptic, seven of which are extant. His biography was written by [[Saint Athanasius]] and titled ''Life of Saint Anthony the Great''. Many stories are also told about him in various collections of sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]].\n[[File:The Torment of Saint Anthony (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|261px|A copy by the young [[Michelangelo]] after [[The Temptation of St Anthony (Schongauer)|an engraving]] by [[Martin Schongauer]] around 1487\u20139, ''[[The Torment of Saint Anthony (Michelangelo)|The Torment of Saint Anthony]]''. Oil and tempera on panel. One of many artistic depictions of Saint Anthony's trials in the desert.]]\nThough Anthony himself did not organize or create a monastery, a community grew around him based on his example of living an [[asceticism|ascetic]] and isolated life. Athanasius' biography helped propagate Anthony's ideals. Athanasius writes, \"For monks, the life of Anthony is a sufficient example of [[asceticism]].\"<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> Asceticism is a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly pleasures, often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals.\n\nThe biography of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped to spread the concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the first to go into the wilderness (about AD 270), a geographical move that seems to have contributed to his renown.[6] Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.\n\nAnthony is appealed to against infectious diseases, particularly skin diseases. In the past, many such afflictions, including [[ergotism]], [[erysipelas]], and [[shingles]], were referred to as ''St. Anthony's fire''.\n\n== Temptation ==\n{{See also|Temptation of Saint Anthony in visual arts}}\nFamously, Anthony is said to have faced a series of supernatural [[temptation]]s during his pilgrimage to the desert. The first to report on the temptation was his contemporary [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. It is possible these events, like the paintings, are full of rich metaphor or in the case of the animals of the desert, perhaps a vision or dream. Some of the stories included in Saint Anthony's biography are perpetuated now mostly in paintings, where they give an opportunity for artists to depict their more lurid or bizarre interpretations. Many artists, including [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Leonora Carrington]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], have depicted these incidents from the life of Anthony; in prose, the tale was retold and embellished by [[Gustave Flaubert]] in ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]''.\n\nEmphasis on these stories, however, did not really begin until the [[Middle Ages]], when the psychology of the individual became of greater interest.<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> Below are some of the tales.\n\n=== The satyr and the centaur ===\n[[File:The Meeting of Saint Anthony and Saint Paul, Master of the Osservanza.jpg|thumb|261px|The Meeting of Saint Anthony and Saint Paul, [[Master of the Osservanza]], 15th century]]\nSaint Anthony was on a journey in the desert to find [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul of Thebes]], who according to his dream was a better Hermit than he.<ref>''Vitae Patrum'', Book 1a- Collected from Jerome. Ch. VI</ref> Saint Anthony had been under the impression that he was the first person to ever dwell in the desert; however, due to the dream, Saint Anthony was called into the desert to find his \"better\", Saint Paul. On his way there, he ran into two [[demon]]s in the forms of a [[centaur]] and a [[satyr]], which Western theology considers to have been temptations.\n\nAt any rate, he was stopped by the two demons and he asked them, \"Who are you?\" To that the satyr replied, \"I am a corpse, one of those whom the heathen call satyrs, and by whom they are snared into idolatry.\" The satyr then tried to terrify the saint while the centaur acknowledged the overthrow of the gods. In the end, the centaur tried to show Saint Anthony the way to his destination while the satyr ended up asking for Saint Anthony's blessing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bacchus|first=Francis|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Saint Paul the Hermit|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11590b.htm|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Silver and gold ===\nAnother time Saint Anthony was travelling in the desert and found a plate of silver coins in his path.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2015/01/17/100216-venerable-and-god-bearing-father-anthony-the-great|title=Venerable and God-bearing Father Anthony the Great|website=oca.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Demons in the cave ===\nOnce, Saint Anthony tried hiding in a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were gathered to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him. God replied, \"I was here but I would see and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast mainly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Legend: The Life of Anthony of Egypt |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden153.htm |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123065522/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden153.htm |archivedate=23 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\nMost of what is known about Saint Anthony comes from the ''Life of Anthony''. Written in Greek around 360 by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], it depicts Anthony as an illiterate and holy man who through his existence in a primordial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth, which always is in harmony with that of Athanasius as the biographer.<ref name=\"Endsjo2008\" /> Sometime before 374 it was translated into Latin by [[Evagrius of Antioch]]. The Latin translation helped the ''Life'' become one of the best known works of literature in the Christian world, a status it would hold through the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>The Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism, Bernhart McGinn {{ISBN|0-8129-7421-2}}</ref>  In addition to the ''Life'', several surviving homilies and epistles of varying authenticity provide some additional autobiographical detail.\n\n[[File:Vaantjeantoniuswarfhuizenkleiner copy.jpg|left|thumb|Pilgrimage banners from the shrine in [[Warfhuizen]]]]\nAnthony had been secretly buried on the mountain-top where he had chosen to live. His remains were reportedly discovered in 361, and transferred to [[Alexandria]]. Some time later, they were taken from Alexandria to [[Constantinople]], so that they might escape the destruction being perpetrated by invading [[Saracen]]s. In the eleventh century, the [[Byzantine emperor]] gave them to the [[French people|French]] [[Count]] Jocelin. Jocelin had them transferred to La-Motte-Saint-Didier, which was then renamed [[Saint-Antoine-en-Dauphin\u00e9]].<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> There, Anthony is credited with assisting in a number of miraculous healings, primarily from [[ergotism]], which became known as \"St. Anthony's Fire\". He was credited by two local noblemen of assisting them in recovery from the disease. They then founded the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony]] in honor of him, who specialized in nursing the victims of skin diseases.<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" />\n\nVeneration of Anthony in the East is more restrained. There are comparatively few icons and paintings of him. He is, however, regarded as the \"first master of the desert and the pinnacle of holy monks\", and there are monastic communities of the Maronite, Chaldean, and Orthodox churches which state that they follow his monastic rule.<ref name=\"ButlerLives1991\" /> During the [[Middle Ages]], Anthony, along with [[Quirinus of Neuss]], [[Pope Cornelius|Cornelius]] and [[Hubertus]], was venerated as one of the [[Four Holy Marshals]] (''Vier Marsch\u00e4lle Gottes'') in the [[Rhineland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Quirinus von Rom|url=http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienQ/Quirinus_von_Rom_von_Neuss.htm|accessdate=25 April 2012|trans-title={{lang-en|Quirinus of Rome}}|language=German}}</ref>\n\n== Coptic literature ==\n{{Christian mysticism}}\n\nExamples of purely [[Coptic literature]] are the works of Saint Anthony and Saint [[Pachomius]], who only spoke Coptic, and the sermons and preachings of [[Saint Shenouda the Archmandrite]], who chose to only write in Coptic. Saint Shenouda was a popular leader who only spoke to Egyptians in the [[Egyptian language]] ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]), not in Greek.\n\nThe earliest original writings in [[Coptic language]] were the letters by Saint Anthony. During the 3rd and 4th centuries many ecclesiastics and monks wrote in Coptic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coptic Literature|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136924/Coptic-literature|accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\n== Popular literature ==\n\nThe main character in the [[Hervey Allen]] novel ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'', and the 1936 film of the same name, is an abandoned child who is placed in a [[foundling wheel]] on the saint's feast day, and given the name Anthony in his honor.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Saints}}\n* [[Coptic Saints]]\n* [[Chariton the Confessor]], contemporary monk in the Judaean desert\n* [[Monastery of Saint Anthony]], Egypt\n* [[Patron saints of ailments, illness and dangers]]\n* [[The temptation of St. Anthony in visual arts|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]\n* [[St. Anthony Hall]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Saint Anthony |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=106 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anthony, Saint |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |pages=96\u201397 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Saint Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n*[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7084 \"Spiritual Considerations on the Life of Saint Antony the Great\"] is a manuscript, from 1864, in Arabic, that is a translation of a Latin work about the life of Saint Anthony\n* [http://www.christianiconography.info/anthonyAbbot.html \"Saint Anthony Abbot\"] at the [http://www.christianiconography.info Christian Iconography] website\n* [http://www.christianiconography.info/goldenLegend/anthonyAbbot.htm \"Of the Life of Saint Anthony\"] from Caxton's translation of the Golden Legend\n*[http://www.stpetersbasilica.info/Exterior/Colonnades/Saints/St%20Anthony%20abbot-128/StAnthony-Abbot.htm Colonnade Statue in St Peter's Square]\n* {{librivox book | title=Life of Anthony | author=Athanasius of Alexandria}}\n\n{{Coptic saints|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anthony the Great}}\n[[Category:Anthony the Great| ]]\n[[Category:251 births]]\n[[Category:356 deaths]]\n[[Category:Saints from Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Egyptian hermits]]\n[[Category:Egyptian centenarians]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Christian monks]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Romans]]\n[[Category:4th-century Romans]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christian theologians]]\n[[Category:Angelic visionaries]]\n[[Category:Coptic Christians]]\n[[Category:Copts]]\n[[Category:Coptic Orthodox saints]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christian monks]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Christian monks]]\n[[Category:Longevity claims]]", "sha1": "flaurw4y4c8msbf74tmv0zubt7nh6av"}}, {"title": "Archdiocese for the Military Services", "ns": "0", "id": "3247", "redirect": {"title": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA"}, "revision": {"id": "783859062", "parentid": "179562959", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:13:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n}}", "sha1": "g9h52fcijtcmc5cbc1ksummvouda27h"}}, {"title": "Archeopteryx", "ns": "0", "id": "3248", "redirect": {"title": "Archaeopteryx"}, "revision": {"id": "769623412", "parentid": "599545052", "timestamp": "2017-03-10T17:54:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "/* top */{{redr}} is deprecated - converting to {{Redirect category shell|}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Archaeopteryx]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from move}}\n{{R from misspelling}}\n}}", "sha1": "t8uyr62bxv63ab7kkp2xsqotn3rmifm"}}, {"title": "Amblypoda", "ns": "0", "id": "3250", "revision": {"id": "774869519", "parentid": "730556037", "timestamp": "2017-04-11T05:01:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "DavidBrooks-AWB", "id": "20962961"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Specific EB1911 attribution using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{One source|date=February 2012}}\n{{update|date=January 2014}}\n}}\n'''Amblypoda''' is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous [[mammal]]s. They were considered a suborder of the primitive [[ungulate]] mammals and have since been shown to represent a [[polyphyletic]] group.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs. The brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest [[rhinoceros]]es. These animals were descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amblypoda|volume=1|pages=795-796|first=Richard|last=Lydekker|authorlink=Richard Lydekker}}</ref>\n\nThe Amblypoda were confined to the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] periods and occurred in [[North America]], [[Asia]] (especially [[Mongolia]]) and [[Europe]]. The cheek teeth were short-crowned ([[brachyodont]]), with the tubercles more-or-less completely fused into transverse ridges, or cross-crests ([[lophodont]] type), and the total number of teeth was in one case the typical 44, but in another was fewer. The [[vertebra]] of the neck unite on nearly flat surfaces, the [[humerus]] had lost the foramen, or perforation, at the lower end, and the third trochanter to the [[femur]] may have also been wanting. In the forelimb, the upper and lower series of [[carpal]] (finger) bones scarcely alternated, but in the hind foot, the astragalus overlapped the cuboid, while the [[fibula]], which was quite distinct from the [[tibia]] (as was the [[radius (bone)|radius]] from the [[ulna]] in the forelimb), articulated with both astragalus and calcaneum.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Types of amblypods==\nThe most generalized type was ''[[Coryphodon]]'', representing the family [[Coryphodontidae]], from the lower Eocene of Europe and North America, in which there were 44 teeth and no horn-like excrescences on the long skull, while the femur had a third trochanter. The canines were somewhat elongated and were followed by a short gap in each jaw, and the cheek-teeth were adapted for succulent food. The length of the body reached about six feet in some cases.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the middle Eocene formations of North America occurred the more specialized ''[[Uintatherium]]'' (or ''Dinoceras''), typifying the family [[Uintatheriidae]]. Uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, of which the elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. The dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p.&nbsp;3/3\u00b74, m. 3/3, the upper canines having been long sabre-like weapons, protected by a descending flange on each side of the lower front jaw.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the basal Eocene of North America, the Amblypoda were represented by extremely primitive, five-toed, small ungulates such as ''[[Periptychus]]'' and ''[[Pantolambda]]'', each of these typifying a family{{Vague|date=April 2009}}.

The mineral occurs in [[pegmatite]] deposits and is easily mistaken for [[albite]] and other [[feldspar]]s. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. Amblygonite forms a series with ''montebrasite'', the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in [[granite]] pegmatites, high-temperature [[tin]] veins, and [[greisen]]s. Amblygonite occurs with [[spodumene]], [[apatite]], [[lepidolite]], [[tourmaline]], and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.  It contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. The chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of California and France.\n\n==History==\nThe mineral was first discovered in [[Saxony]] by [[August Breithaupt]] in 1817, and named by him from the Greek ''amblus'', blunt, and ''gonia'', angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. Later it was found at Montebras, Creuse, [[France]], and at Hebron in [[Maine]]; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities.  It has been discovered in considerable quantity at Pala in San Diego county, [[California]];  Caceres, [[Spain]]; and the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. The largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62\u00d72.44\u00d71.83 m<sup>3</sup> and weighed ~102 tons.<ref>{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885\u2013907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P.

Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).\n\n== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==\nIn 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.<ref name=\"ncbi\" /> The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.<ref name=\"ncbi\" />\n\n== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==\nEarly travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.\n\nAn example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army.

[[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:\n\n{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.<ref>[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52</ref>}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[Jos\u00e9 Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - \"to take an oath\"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.<ref name=Hurley14>{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

It is also used by [[Presbyterians]], [[Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] in structure with sections affirming belief in [[God the Father]], [[God the Son|Jesus Christ His Son]] and the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[Canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian Creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[God the Son|Jesus]] or the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. This makes it acceptable to many [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a synod in [[Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]], each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].\n\n===United Methodist Church===\nThe [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], founders of [[Methodism]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate = May 19, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093223/http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html | archivedate= May 18, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources | accessdate = May 19, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093227/http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html| archivedate = May 18, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> It is notable for omitting the line \"he descended into hell\", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/apostles-creed-traditional-ecumenical | title = Apostle's Creed Traditional and Ecumenical Versions | publisher = The United Methodist Church |accessdate= July 15, 2015 }}</ref> which includes \"he descended to the dead.\"\n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\nI believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.\n\n==Liturgical use in Western Christianity==\n{{Globalize/US|section|date=December 2015}}\nThe liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the [[Roman Missal]], including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' ([[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and Episcopalians), ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]), ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' ([[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]), and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]'' ([[The United Methodist Church]]), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of [[Baptism]], which they consider to be the [[sacrament]] of initiation into the Church.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n\n====Rite of Baptism====\nAn interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974):\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\n====Profession of faith at Mass====\nSince the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the [[Roman Missal]] with the indication, \"Instead of the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed, may be used.\"<ref>{{Citation |url=https://sites.google.com/site/litcomwenty/resources/resources--sunday-eucharist/roman-missal/apostles-creed |title=Roman Missal <nowiki>|</nowiki> Apostles' Creed |publisher=[[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] |publication-place=[[Wentworthville]] |year=2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}.</ref> Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.\n\n====Use in the Divine Office====\nIn the 1962 [[Breviary]], authorized by [[Summorum Pontificum]], the Apostles' Creed is recited at [[Prime]] and [[Compline]] on certain days during Advent and Lent as part of the ''[[Preces]]'', a series of versicles and responses preceded by ''Kyrie, eleison'' (\"Lord, have mercy\") and the [[Our Father]]. In prior editions, it was also said after the Our Father and [[Hail Mary]] before [[Matins]] and Prime, and after Compline.\n\n===Anglican Communion===\nThe Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] ([[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]]). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the [[Canticle]]s, and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]].\n\n====Episcopal Church (United States)====\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism.<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.\n\n1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.\n\n2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.\n\n3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: \"I do.\"\n\n3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in \"the Christian faith and life\" (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through \"prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ\" to which the parents will state to each, \"I will, with God's help.\"\n\n4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always \"I renounce them\":\n\n:''Do you renounce [[Satan]] and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?''\n:''Do you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?''\n:''Do you renounce all [[sin]]ful desires that draw you from the love of God?''\n\n5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always \"I do\":\n:''Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your [[salvation|Savior]]?''\n:''Do you put your whole trust in his [[divinity|grace]] and [[love]]?''\n:''Do you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?''\n\n6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'\n\n===Lutheran Church===\n[[Lutheran]]s following the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' ([[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]]), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?\n\nFollowing each question, the candidate answers by saying \"Yes, I believe\". If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.<ref>{{Citation | title = Lutheran Service Book | contribution = Rite of Baptism}}.</ref>\n\nFor ELCA Lutherans who use the [[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]] book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.\n\n===Methodism===\n[[Methodism|Methodists]] use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church's sacramental act. For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.\n:Do you believe in God?\n:I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\n\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\n:I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit?\n:I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.<ref>{{Citation | title = The United Methodist Hymnal | chapter = Baptismal Covenant I | page = 35}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Nicene Creed]]\n* [[Chalcedonian Creed]]\n* [[Lutheran Book of Worship]]\n* [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]\n* [[Passion of Jesus]]\n* [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation | last1 =Cannata | first1 = Raymond F. | last2 = Reitano | first2 = Joshua D. |author1-link= Raymond F.

(A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an [[aliquot sequence]] of [[Periodic sequence|period]] 2. A related concept is that of a [[perfect number]], which is a number that equals the sum of ''its own'' proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as [[sociable number]]s.\n\nThe smallest pair of amicable numbers is ([[220 (number)|220]], [[284 (number)|284]]). They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.\n\nThe first ten amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368), (10744, 10856), (12285, 14595), (17296, 18416), (63020, 76084), and (66928, 66992). {{OEIS|id=A259180}}. (Also see {{oeis|id=A002025}} and {{oeis|id=A002046}})\n\n== History ==\nAmicable numbers were known to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra]] (826\u2013901). Other [[Arab]] mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|al-Majriti]] (died 1007), [[Ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (980\u20131037), and [[Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-F\u0101ris\u012b|al-F\u0101ris\u012b]] (1260\u20131320). The [[Iran]]ian mathematician [[Muhammad Baqir Yazdi]] (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Costello |first = Patrick  | title = New Amicable Pairs Of Type (2; 2) And Type (3; 2)  | journal = Mathematics of Computation | volume = 72 | pages = 489\u2013497 | publisher = American Mathematical Society  | date = 1 May 2002 | url = http://www.ams.org/mcom/2003-72-241/S0025-5718-02-01414-X/S0025-5718-02-01414-X.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007 |issue=241 | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-02-01414-X}}\n</ref> Much of the work of [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Eastern mathematicians]] in this area has been forgotten.\n\nTh\u0101bit ibn Qurra's formula was rediscovered by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] (1601\u20131665) and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] (1596\u20131650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707\u20131783). It was extended further by [[Walter Borho|Borho]] in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians.

This formula gives the pairs {{math|(220, 284)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|(17296, 18416)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}, and {{math|(9363584, 9437056)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}, but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form {{math|3\u00d72<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} are known as [[Thabit number]]s. In order for Ibn Qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of {{mvar|n}}.\n\nTo establish the theorem, Th\u00e2bit ibn Qurra proved nine [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] divided into two groups. The first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. The second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.<ref name=\"Rashed\">{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra.|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Boston, London|year=1994|volume=156|isbn=0-7923-2565-6|page=278,279}}</ref>\n\n===Euler's rule===\n''Euler's rule'' is a generalization of the Th\u00e2bit ibn Qurra theorem.

Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra's theorem corresponds to the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n'' \u2212 1}}. Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for {{math|(''m'',''n'') {{=}} (1,8), (29,40)}} with no others being known.

If {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} are both [[coprime]] to {{mvar|g}} and [[Square-free integer|square free]] then the pair ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is said to be '''regular''' {{OEIS|A215491}}, otherwise it is called '''irregular''' or '''exotic'''. If ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is regular and {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} have {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} prime factors respectively, then {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is said to be of '''type''' {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}}.\n\nFor example, with {{math|(''m'', ''n'') {{=}} (220, 284)}}, the greatest common divisor is {{math|4}} and so {{math|''M'' {{=}} 55}} and {{math|''N'' {{=}} 71}}. Therefore, {{math|(220, 284)}} is regular of type {{math|(2, 1)}}.\n\n== Twin amicable pairs ==\nAn amicable pair {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is twin if there are no integers between {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} belonging to any other amicable pair {{OEIS|A273259}}.\n\n== Other results ==\nIn every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[Even and odd numbers|even]] or both odd. It is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. However, amicable numbers where the two members have different smallest prime factors do exist: there are seven such pairs known.<ref>http://sech.me/ap/news.html#20160130</ref> Also, every known pair shares at least one common prime [[Divisor|factor]].

White and semi-[[translucent]], it is sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. It can be used to make jellies, [[puddings]], and [[custard]]s. For making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. Sweetener, flavouring, colouring, fruit or vegetables are then added and the liquid is poured into [[molding (process)|molds]] to be served as desserts and vegetable [[aspic]]s, or incorporated with other desserts, such as a jelly layer in a [[cake]].\n\nAgar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. Its bulking quality has been behind fad diets in Asia, for example the ''kanten'' (the Japanese word for agar-agar<ref name=\"oxford\" />) diet. Once ingested, ''kanten'' triples in size and absorbs water. This results in the consumers feeling fuller. This diet has recently received some press coverage in the United States as well. The diet has shown promise in obesity studies.<ref name=\"Maeda\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda H, Yamamoto R, Hirao K, Tochikubo O | title=Effects of agar (kanten) diet on obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes | date = January 2005 | journal = Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=1 |pmid=15642074 | pages = 40\u20136 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2004.00370.x }}</ref>\n\nOne use of agar in [[Japanese cuisine]] ([[Wagashi]]) is ''[[anmitsu]]'', a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. It is also the main ingredient in ''mizu y\u014dkan'', another popular Japanese food.\n\nIn [[Philippine cuisine]], it is used to make the jelly bars in the various [[gulaman]] refreshments or desserts such as ''sago gulaman'', ''buko pandan'', ''agar flan'', ''[[halo-halo]]'', and the black and red ''gulaman'' used in various fruit salads.\n\nIn [[Vietnamese cuisine]], jellies made of flavored layers of agar agar, called ''th\u1ea1ch'', are a popular dessert, and are often made in ornate molds for special occasions. In [[Indian cuisine]], agar agar is known as \"China grass\" and is used for making desserts. In [[Burmese cuisine]], a sweet jelly known as ''kyauk kyaw''  {{IPA-my|t\u0255a\u028a\u0294t\u0255\u0254\u0301|}} is made from agar.\n\nIn Russia, it is used in addition or as a replacement to [[pectin]] in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. Another use of agar-agar is in ''ptich'ye moloko'' ([[bird's milk]]), a rich jellified custard (or soft [[meringue]]) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets. Agar-agar may also be used as the gelling agent in gel clarification, a culinary technique used to clarify stocks, sauces, and other liquids.\n\n[[Mexico]] has traditional candies made out of Agar gelatin, most of them in colorful, half-circle shapes that resemble a [[melon]] or [[watermelon]] fruit slice, and commonly covered with sugar. They are known in Spanish as ''Dulce de Agar'' (Agar sweets)\n\nAgar-agar is an allowed nonorganic/nonsynthetic additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, texturizer, moisturizer, emulsifier, flavor enhancer, and absorbent in certified organic foods.<ref>[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5096516 Agar-agar Review Sheet], USDA Organic Materials Review, April 1995.</ref>\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n[[Image:Agar Plate.jpg|right|thumb|100mm diameter [[Petri dish]]es containing agar gel for bacterial culture]]\n{{Main|Agar plate}}\n\nAn agar plate or Petri dish is used to provide a [[growth medium]] using a mix of agar and other nutrients in which microorganisms, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], can be cultured and observed under the microscope. Agar is indigestible for many organisms so that microbial growth does not affect the gel used and it remains stable. Agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. Other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the [[microbe]]s. Many specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others.  Agar is often dispensed using a sterile [[media dispenser]].\n\n==== Motility assays ====\nAs a gel, an agar or agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's \"point of view\") can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.\n\nA common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. Cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized, whereas non-motile species will show growth only along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.\n\nAnother setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay, whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. As a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.\n\n=== Plant biology ===\n[[Image:Physcomitrella growing on agar plates.jpg|thumb|''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' plants growing [[axenic]]ally [[in vitro]] on [[agar plate]]s ([[Petri dish]], 9&nbsp;cm diameter).]]\n\nResearch grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in Petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). Nutrient and vitamin supplementation for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is standard across most experimental conditions. [[Murashige and Skoog medium|Murashige & Skoog]] (MS) nutrient mix and Gamborg's B5 vitamin mix in general are used. A 1.0% agar/0.44% MS+vitamin dH<sub>2</sub>O solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.\n\nWhen using agar, within any growth medium, it is important to know that the solidification of the agar is pH-dependent. The optimal range for solidification is between 5.4-5.7.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Se-Kwon|title=Handbook of marine macroalgae : biotechnology and applied phycology|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780470979181|edition=1st imp.}}</ref> Usually, the application of KOH is needed to increase the pH to this range. A general guideline is about 600 \u00b5l 0.1M KOH per 250 ml GM. This entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an [[autoclave]].\n\nThis medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of GM, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often-polar hormones. This hormone/GM solution can be spread across the surface of Petri dishes sown with germinated and/or etiolated seedlings.\n\nExperiments with the [[moss]] ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', however, have shown that choice of the gelling agent&nbsp;\u2014 agar or [[Gellan gum|Gelrite]] - does influence [[phytohormone]] sensitivity of the [[plant]] [[cell culture]].<ref name=\"Birgit Hadeler\">\n{{cite journal|title=Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a moss |journal=Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=369\u2013371|author1 = Birgit Hadeler|author2 = Sirkka Scholz|author3=Ralf Reski |authorlink3=Ralf Reski |doi=10.1016/s0176-1617(11)82071-7|year=1995 }}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nAgar is used:\n* As an [[Dental impression|impression material]] in [[dentistry]].\n* As a medium to precisely orient the tissue specimen and secure it by '''agar pre-embedding''' (especially useful for small endoscopy biopsy specimens) for [[histopathology]] processing<ref>about agar pre-embedding in histopathology [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272189364_Improvised_double-embedding_technique_of_minute_biopsies_A_mega_boon_to_histopathology_laboratory].</ref>\n* To make [[salt bridge]]s and gel plugs for use in [[electrochemistry]].\n* In [[formicarium]]s as a transparent substitute for sand and a source of nutrition.\n* As a natural ingredient to form [[modelling clay]] for young children to play with.\n* As an allowed biofertilizer component in organic farming.<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=icgrAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA184&dq=agar+organic+farming Integrated Organic Farming Handbook], H.

It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[Properties of water|water molecules]] in the [[atmosphere]] to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes, and sulphur dioxide is produced by [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]]. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and [[weathering]] of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\n\n==Definition==\n\"Acid rain\" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a [[pH]] greater than 7 are alkaline. \"Clean\" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:\n\n:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq)\n\nCarbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[hydronium]] ions:\n\n:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}<sup>+</sup> (aq)\n\nHowever, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level).

They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1990, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-subchapter-acid-deposition-control |title=Clean Air Act Title IV - Subchapter A: Acid Deposition Control &#124; Overview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-03-20}}</ref> Title IV of these amendments established the a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulphur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulphur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.\n\nDuring the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.<ref name=\"US Environmental Protection Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214841/http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOverall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals.

Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulphur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO<sub>2</sub> comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7\u20138 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].<ref name=\"Berresheim 1995\">Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D.

Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Po\u00e1s Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.\nAcid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulphur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].\n\nNitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&lang=en&s=nitric%20acid|title=|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAcidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.<ref name=\"Likens, G.

Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.\n\n==Chemical processes==\nCombustion of fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulphuric acid and nitric acid.<ref name=\"CAA01\">[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998</ref>\n\n===Gas phase chemistry===\nIn the [[gas phase]] sulphur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:<ref name=\"Seinfeld 1998\"/>\n:SO<sub>2</sub> + OH\u00b7 \u2192 HOSO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7\nwhich is followed by:\n:HOSO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7 + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7 + SO<sub>3</sub>\nIn the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide|sulphur trioxide]] (SO<sub>3</sub>) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]]:\n:SO<sub>3</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq)\n\n[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:\n[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&Effects.svg|thumb|This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.]]\n:NO<sub>2</sub> + OH\u00b7 \u2192 HNO<sub>3</sub>\n\n===Chemistry in cloud droplets===\nWhen clouds are present, the loss rate of SO<sub>2</sub> is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone.

This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\n\n===Dry deposition===\nAcid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation.

However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their [[exoskeleton]]s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/headline_universe/olpa/acid_coasts_7sept07.html|title=Acid Rain Has Disproportionate Impact on Near-Shore Ocean Waters - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org}}</ref>\n\nCoral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.\n\n===Human health effects===\nAcid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain \u2013 Human Health].

For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO<sub>2</sub> in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulphur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulphur pollution into industrial sulfates.\n\nIn some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.\n\n[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulphur emitted by power production.\n\n[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.\n\n===International treaties===\nA number of international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.\n\n===Emissions trading===\n{{main|Emissions trading}}\n{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}\nIn this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.\n\nThe first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]<ref>Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.</ref>. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act<ref>Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651</ref> is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Basic precipitation]]\n* [[Gene Likens]]\n* [[List of environmental issues]]\n* [[Lists of environmental topics]]\n* [[Ocean acidification]]\n* [[Rain dust]] (an ''alkaline rain'')\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/AQRS/reports/napapreport05.pdf National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program Report] \u2013 a 98-page report to Congress (2005)\n* [http://www.geography-site.co.uk/pages/environ/acid.html Acid rain for schools]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080815095700/http://www.hubbardbrookfoundation.org/education_outreach/ Acid rain for schools \u2013 Hubbard Brook]\n* [http://www.AcidRainRetirementFund.org Acid Rain Retirement Fund environmental education links about acid rain]\n* United States Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 [http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/acidrain/index.html New England Acid Rain Program] (superficial)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421175435/http://www.enviroliteracy.org/article.php/2.html Acid Rain] (more depth than ref. above)\n* U.S. Geological Survey \u2013 [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/acidrain/2.html What is acid rain?]\n* [http://www2.iq.usp.br/docente/gutz/Curtipot_.html Acid rain analysis \u2013 freeware for simulation and evaluation of titration curves and pH calculations]\n* [http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/environment/pollution/acid-rain-pollution-and-politics/topic---acid-rain-pollution-and-politics.html CBC Digital Archives&nbsp;\u2013 Acid Rain: Pollution and Politics]\n* [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es0626133 Larssen, Thorj\u00f8rn et al. \"Acid Rain in China\".

Accessed 27 January 2007.</ref>\n\nHe was the fifth but third surviving son of [[Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony]], and [[Maria Antonia of Bavaria]].\n\n==Early life==\nWith few chances to take part in the politics of the Electorate of Saxony or receive any land from his older brother Frederick Augustus III, Anton lived under the shadows. No Elector of Saxony after Johann Georg I gave appananges to his younger sons.\n\nDuring the first years of the reign of his older brother as Elector, Anton was the third in line, preceded only by his older brother Karl. The death of Karl (8 September 1781) make him the next in line to the Electorate as Crown Prince (de: ''Kronprinz''); this was because all the pregnancies of the Electress Amalie, except for one daughter, ended in a stillbirth.\n\nHis aunt, the [[Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731\u20131767)|Dauphine of France]], had wanted to engage her daughter [[Princess Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France|Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France]] to Anthony; Marie Z\u00e9phyrine died in 1755 abandoning plans. Another French candidate was Marie Z\u00e9phyrine's sister [[Clotilde de France|Marie Clothilde]] (later [[Queen of Sardinia]]) but again nothing happened.\n\nIn [[Turin]] on 29 September 1781 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 24 October 1781 (in person), Anton married firstly with the Princess [[Caroline of Savoy]] (Maria Carolina Antonietta Adelaida), daughter of the King [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] and [[Maria Antonietta of Spain]]. Caroline died after only one year of marriage, on 28 December 1782 having succumbed to [[smallpox]]. They had no children.\n\nIn [[Florence]] on 8 September 1787 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 18 October 1787 (in person), Anton married a second time with the Archduchess [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767\u20131827)|Maria Theresia of Austria]] (Maria Theresia Josephe Charlotte Johanna), daughter of the Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, later [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]]. [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' was originally intended to be performed in honor of Anton and his wife for a visit to [[Prague]] on 14 October 1787, as they traveled between Dresden and [[Vienna]], and [[libretto]]s were printed with dedication to them. The [[premiere]] could not be arranged in time, however, so the opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' was substituted on the express orders of the bride's uncle, Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The choice of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' was considered improper for a new bride by many observers, and the couple left the opera theater early without seeing the entire work performed. Mozart complained bitterly of the intrigues surrounding this incident in a letter to his friend Gottfried von Jacquin that was written in stages between 15 October and 25 October 1787. Anthony was also present in Prague in September 1791 for the first performance of Mozart's opera ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', which was written as part of the coronation ceremonies of his father-in-law, Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], as [[King of Bohemia]].<ref>Anthony's presence at performances of Mozart's music is detailed in [[Daniel E.

After this Anton became, officially, the Heir to the Electorate and, from 1806, the Kingdom of Saxony.\n\n==King of Saxony==\n[[File:Saxony 1831 Pewter Medal for the 1st Constitution, obverse.jpg|thumb|left|Medal of the introduction the  Constitution of 1831.

The 71-year-old new king was completely inexperienced in government, thus he had no intention of initiating profound changes in foreign or domestic policy.\n\n[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] diplomats discussed granting the [[Rhine Province|Prussian Rhineland]] (predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]) to Anton (a Catholic) in exchange for [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Saxony in 1827, but nothing came of these talks.<ref name=\"Freitag\">Freitag, p. 216</ref>\n\nAfter the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in France, disturbances in Saxony began in autumn. These were directed primarily against the old Constitution. Therefore, on 13 September the cabinet dismissed Count [[Detlev von Einsiedel]], followed by [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]. Because the people wished a younger regent, Anton agreed to appoint his nephew Frederick Augustus Prince Co-Regent (de: ''Prinz-Mitregenten''). As another consequence of the disturbances, a new constitution was accepted in 1831 which came into effect on 4 September of that year. With it Saxony became a [[Constitutional monarchy]] and obtained a bi-cameral legislature and a responsible ministry, which replaced the old feudal estates.  The constitution was more conservative than other constitutions existing at this time in the German Union. Still the constitution served Saxony until 1918.<ref>James K. Pollock & Homer Thomas, ''Germany in Power and Eclipse'' D. Van Nostrand Co.: New York, 1952, p. 510.</ref> The king kept his exclusive sovereignty but was bound by the Government Business to cooperate with the Ministers and the decisions of both Chambers of the States (de: ''Kammern der St\u00e4ndeversammlung'') meeting. The entry of Saxony into the ''[[Zollverein]]'' in 1833 let trade, industry and traffic blossom farther.\n\nWithout surviving male issue, Anton was succeeded as king by his nephew, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony|Frederick Augustus II]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA99|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=99}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Alice and her restaurant are the subjects of the recurrent refrain, but are generally mentioned only incidentally in the story (early drafts of the song explained that the restaurant was a place to hide from the police).

The part of his father Woody Guthrie, who had died in 1967, was played by an actor, Joseph Boley; Alice, who made a [[cameo appearance]] as an extra, was also recast, with actress Pat Quinn in the title role.

But in 1972 Guthrie had a highly successful single too, [[Steve Goodman]]'s song \"[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]\", a wistful [[paean]] to long-distance passenger [[railway|rail]] travel. Guthrie's first trip on that train was in December 2005 (when his family joined other musicians on a train trip across the country to raise money for musicians financially devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], in the South of the United States). He also had a minor hit with his song \"Coming into Los Angeles\", which was played at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] but did not get much radio airplay because of its plot (involving the smuggling of drugs from London by airplane),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rutlandherald.com/features/vermont_arts/alice-s-restaurant-is-back/article_18adacde-d843-53d5-8ec2-2d6b83a489f0.html|title=\u2018Alice\u2019s Restaurant\u2019 is back|author=Art Edelstein|website=Rutlandherald.com|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}</ref> and success with a live version of \"[[The Motorcycle Song]]\" (one of the songs on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Alice's Restaurant Album\").

Usually, he has appeared as himself, often performing music and/or being interviewed about the 1960s, folk music and various social causes.

He collaborated with poet [[Adrian Mitchell]] to tell the story of Chilean folk singer and activist [[V\u00edctor Jara]] in song.  He regularly performed with folk musician Pete Seeger, one of his father's longtime partners. [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who had lived for two years in the Guthries' home before Arlo left for boarding school, had absorbed Woody's style perhaps better than anyone; Arlo has been said to have credited Elliott for passing it along to him. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn 1991, Guthrie bought the church that had served as Alice and Ray Brock's former home in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], and converted it to the Guthrie Center, an interfaith meeting place that serves people of all religions.  The center provides weekly free lunches in the community and support for families living with HIV/AIDS as well as other life-threatening illnesses. It also hosts a summertime concert series and Guthrie does six or seven fund raising shows there every year.

The title refers to [[Alma the Younger]], a prophet and \"chief judge\" of the Nephites.\n\n==Narrative==\n\n===Historical outline===\nThe Book of Alma is the longest of all the books of the Book of Mormon, consisting of 63 chapters. The book records the first 39 years of what the [[Nephite]]s termed \"the reign of the judges\", a period in which the Nephite nation adopted a constitutional theocratic government in which the judicial and executive branches of the government were combined.\n\nThe history of the book is outlined as follows:\n\n====Challenges to the beginning of the republic====\nThe first four chapters, describe the rebellions of followers of [[Nehor]] and [[Amlici]]. Contrary to the dominant lay ministry that existed in the Nephite culture, Nehor established a church in which priests were given a separate social status and were paid for their ministry. After killing a religious leader during a theological argument, Nehor was tried and executed for his crimes. The followers of Amlici resented the dominant political and religious parties and sought to reestablish the monarchy that the reign of the judges had replaced. [[Alma the Younger|Alma]], who was chief judge, governor, and high priest over the people of Nephi, led an army against Amlici and his followers and drove the rebellion out of the land.\n\n====Ministry of Alma among the Nephites====\nTowards the end of chapter four, Alma realizes that the affairs of the Church require his entire concentration. He resigns from his political office and appoints [[Various Book of Mormon people#Nephihah|Nephihah]] as chief judge and governor of the land.  Chapters 5-16 record sermons and missionary travels of Alma between 83 and 78 BC.  Alma and one of his converted followers, Amulek, provide important teachings about the atonement of Christ, overcoming pride and the natural man, retaining conversion, the resurrection of all men, and judgment day.  Later, their teachings about faith and worship in Alma 32-34 are important sources of instruction and insight.\n\n====Ministry of the sons of Mosiah among the Lamanites====\nChapters 17 to 27 describe the missionary labors of the sons of [[King Mosiah II]] who was the last king over the people of Nephi prior to the peaceful transition of the nation from a monarchy to a republican form of government. The [[sons of Mosiah]], named Ammon, [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]] and [[Himni]], chose to devote themselves to missionary labors preaching to the people of the [[Lamanite]] nation, which periodically went to war against the Nephite nation. They lived and taught among the Lamanites between the years 91 and 77 BC.\n\n====Ministry of Alma among the Zoramites====\nChapters 28 to 35 relate the account of a rebellion of a subgroup of the Nephite nation who called themselves [[Zoramites]]. The Zoramites believed in a form of predestination and taught that all others except their people would be damned. Their apostasy from the Church was conjoined with plans to rebel against the Nephite government. Alma took two of his sons, the sons of Mosiah, Amulek, and [[Zeezrom]] on a mission among the Zoramites in an attempt to restore their loyalty to both the Church and the state.  Alma and his companions had some success among the poor class of Zoramites who were then exiled from the Zoramite community by the governing rich class of Zoramites. The wealthier Zoramites eventually defected and united with the Lamanites.\n\n====Commandments of Alma to his children====\nChapters 36 to 42 record the teachings of Alma to his sons, [[Helaman]], [[Shiblon]], and [[Corianton]]. These teachings discuss the ministry and atonement of [[Jesus]], the laws of justice and mercy, the need for repentance, and the resurrection and judgment of all people.\n\n====Period of war====\n\nChapters 43 to 62 record the struggles of the Nephite people during a war against the attacking Lamanite nation between the years of 74 and 57 BC. The Chief Captain (senior military commander) of the Nephites during this time was [[Captain Moroni]]. The Nephites were ultimately successful in their defense against the Lamanites.\n\n====Conclusion====\nChapter 63 includes concluding historical notes covering the years 56 to 53 BC. This is largely a period of post-war reconstruction and exploration in the Nephite nation.\n\n===Simple outline===\n\nThis outline is based on ''main sections'' and ''[[antagonist]] characters'' in the Book of Alma. There are two main features in this history, chapters 1 - 42 deal with Missionary Work, and chapters 43 - 63 contain the Wars. The history of the [[Zoramites]] provides a transition from Missionary Work to the War chapters of the Book of Alma. The two main sections also mirror the first two antagonist characters, Nehor (''religious agenda'') and Amlici (''political agenda'').\n\n*'''Mission chapters''' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/4/19-20#19 Alma 1-42])\n**[[Nehor]]: rebels against the Church ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/1/2,15#2 Alma 1])\n**[[Amlici]]: rebels against the Republic ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/2/1 Alma 2])\n**[[Korihor]]: the [[AntiChrist]] ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/30/12 Alma 30])\n*'''Zoramites''' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/31/1 Alma 31 - 43])\n**[[Zoram]]: the Apostate Nephites  ''religious''  ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/31/1 Alma 31])\n**[[Zerahemnah]]: the war leader of the Zoramites  ''political'' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/43/5 Alma 43])\n*'''War chapters''' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/43/3 Alma 43-63])\n**[[Amalickiah]]: the man who wants to be king ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/46/3 Alma 46])\n**[[Ammoron]]: the vengeful brother of Amalickiah ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/52/3 Alma 52])\n\n==Characters==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Protagonist===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Alma the Younger]]\n*[[Gideon (Book of Mormon)|Gideon]]\n*[[Nephihah]]\n*[[Sons of Mosiah]]\n**[[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]]\n**[[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron<sup>3</sup>]]\n**[[Omner]]\n**[[Himni]]\n*[[Amulek]]\n*[[Zoram|Zoram<sup>2</sup>]]\n*[[Ammon]]\n*Melek\n*[[Lehonti]]\n*[[Helaman]]\n*[[Shiblon]]\n*[[Corianton]]\n*[[Captain Moroni]]\n*[[Two thousand stripling warriors]]\n*[[Teancum]]\n*[[Laman|Laman<sup>4</sup>]]\n*[[Gid (Book of Mormon)|Gid]]\n*[[Teomner]]\n*[[Pahoran]]\n*[[Hagoth]]\n*[[Moronihah]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Antagonist===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Nehor]]\n*[[Amlici]]\n*[[Korihor]]\n*[[Zoram]]\n*[[Zerahemnah]]\n*[[Amalickiah]]\n*[[Morianton]]\n*[[Ammoron]]\n*[[Captain Moroni#King-men|King-men]]\n*[[Gidoni]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Converts===\n*[[Zeezrom]]\n*[[Lamoni]]\n*[[Anti-Nephi-Lehi]]\n\n==Doctrine==\n\n=== 50 questions of Alma ===\nIn {{lds|Alma|alma|5}}, Alma the Younger speaks to the people of Zarahemla in which he asks 50 rhetorical questions, which are widely cited in the LDS church.\n\n===Faith as a seed===\n\nAlma's sermon on faith to the Zoramites in {{lds|Alma|alma|32}} is widely used to explain the process of developing faith.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/04/faith-in-jesus-christ |title= Faith in Jesus Christ |first= James O. |last= Mason |authorlink= James O.

Oxidation is a [[chemical reaction]] that can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], thereby leading to [[chain reaction]]s that may damage the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of organisms.

They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a \"crazy paving\" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product. Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit.

Collectively known as [[brass instrument]]s, these include the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]], and many other \"[[Horn_(instrument)|horn]]s\", many in variously-sized families, such as the [[saxhorns]]. Other [[wind instrument]]s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s are made of some variety of brass, usually a [[cupronickel]] [[alloy]] similar to [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. [[Clarinets]], especially low clarinets such as the [[contrabass]] and [[subcontrabass]], are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller [[woodwind]]s. For the same reason, some low [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]]s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the [[saxophone]]s and [[sarrusaphone]]s are classified as [[woodwind instrument]]s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.\n\nThe keywork of most modern [[woodwind]]s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as [[Nickel Silver]]/[[German Silver]]. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools -- a boon to quick repairs. The [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]s of both [[brass instruments]] and, less commonly, [[woodwind]] instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.\n\nNext to the [[brass instruments]], the most notable use of brass in music is in various [[percussion instrument]]s, most notably [[cymbal]]s, [[gong]]s, and [[chimes|orchestral (tubular) bells]] (large \"church\" [[bell]]s are normally made of [[bronze]]). Small [[handbell]]s and \"[[jingle bell]]\" are also commonly made of brass.\n\nThe [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat \"through\" the shallot in the case of a \"free\" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass. Some parts on [[electric guitars]] are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.\n\n==Germicidal and antimicrobial applications==\n{{Main article|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\n\n{{See also|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}\n\nThe [[bactericidal]] properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents [[biofouling]]. Depending upon the type and concentration of [[pathogen]]s and the medium they are in, brass kills these [[microorganism]]s within a few minutes to hours of contact.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/>\n\nA large number of independent studies<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/><ref name=r1/><ref name=r10/><ref name=r20/><ref name=r25/> confirm this antimicrobial effect, even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRSA.

The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[British Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.\n\n==Brass types==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | Proportion by weight (%)\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n!

In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd\u0101n\u012b|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) \"The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe\" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252\u20137</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the \"power\" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176\u20138</ref> \nGerman brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173\u20135</ref>\n\n===Brass in Africa===\n[[File:Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century \"[[Bronze Head from Ife]]\", actually of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\"]]\nSome of the most famous objects in [[African art]] are the [[lost wax]] castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now [[Nigeria]], produced first by the [[Kingdom of Ife]] and then the [[Benin Empire]].  Though normally described as \"bronzes\", the [[Benin Bronzes]], now mostly in the [[British Museum]] and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the [[Bronze Head from Ife]] of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\" and the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=618380 \"The Ife Head\"] on the British Museum collection database. Accessed 26 May 2014</ref>  Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in [[Benin art]] and other West African traditions such as [[Akan goldweights]], where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.\n\n===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95\u2013111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105\u20136</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref>\n\n16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181\u20132, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>\n\nEventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloy]]ed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref>, and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was \"nothing else but unmeltable zinc\" and that zinc was a \"half ripe metal.\"<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198\u20139</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\"/>\n \nHowever, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900\u2013950&nbsp;\u00b0C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226\u20137.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\">Day 1990, p. 131</ref> By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\"/> After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].<ref>Day 1991, pp. 135\u201344</ref> In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.<ref>Day 1990, p. 138</ref> This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 227</ref>\n\nIn 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or \"the English process.\"<ref>Day 1991, pp. 179\u201381</ref><ref name=r3/> This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clocks]], brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\">Day 1991, p. 183</ref> However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\"/> and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].<ref name=r2/> By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc<ref>Day 1991, pp. 186\u20139</ref> as well as demand for [[corrosion]]-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.<ref>Day 1991, pp. 192\u20133, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 228</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Brass}}\n\n*[[Tombac]]\n*[[Brass bed]]\n*[[Brass rubbing]]\n*[[Bronze and brass ornamental work]]\n*[[List of copper alloys]]\n*[[Pinchbeck

To the north, Bonn borders the [[Cologne Lowland]]. Natural borders are constituted by the river [[Sieg]] to the north-east and by the [[Siebengebirge]] (also known as the Seven Hills) to the east. The largest extension of the city in north-south dimensions is {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in west-east dimensions. The city borders have a total length of {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}}. The geographical centre of Bonn is the Bundeskanzlerplatz ''(Chancellor Square)'' in Bonn-Gronau.\n\n=== Administration ===\nThe [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is divided into five [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] ({{lang-de|Regierungsbezirk}}), and Bonn is part of the [[Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln|governmental district of Cologne]] ({{lang-de|Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln}}). Within this governmental district, the city of Bonn is an [[List of districts of Germany|urban district]] in its own right. The urban district of Bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts ({{lang-de|Stadtbezirk}}). These are Bonn, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Bonn-Beuel and Bonn-Hardtberg.\nIn 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and Beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.\n{| class=\"wikitable zebra\"\n|+Administrative divisions of the Federal City of Bonn<!--Please do not add any sub-districts, as this is the official count.-->\n!Municipal district ''(Stadtbezirk)''\n!Coat of arms\n!Population <small>(as of December 2014)</small><ref>{{cite web |title=Wohnberechtigte Bev\u00f6lkerung in der Stadt Bonn am 31.12.2014 |language=German |trans-title=|periodical=bonn.de |publisher=Stadt Bonn |url=http://www2.bonn.de/statistik/default.asp?2.1 |accessdate=2016-02-02 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227103913/http://www2.bonn.de/statistik/default.asp?2.1 |archive-date=2014-02-27}}</ref>\n!Sub-district ''(Stadtteil)''\n|-\n|[[Bad Godesberg]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Wappen-bezirk-badgodesberg.svg|35px|Wappen des Stadtbezirks Bad Godesberg]]\n| align=\"right\" |73.172\n|Alt-Godesberg, [[Friesdorf (Bonn)|Friesdorf]], Godesberg-Nord, Godesberg-Villenviertel, Heiderhof, Hochkreuz, Lannesdorf, Mehlem, Muffendorf, Pennenfeld, Plittersdorf, R\u00fcngsdorf, Schweinheim\n|-\n|Beuel\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Wappen-bezirk-beuel.svg|35px|Wappen des Stadtbezirks Beuel]]\n| align=\"right\" |66.695\n|Beuel-Mitte, Beuel-Ost, Geislar, Hoholz, Holtorf, [[Holzlar]], [[K\u00fcdinghoven]], Limperich, [[Oberkassel (Bonn)|Oberkassel]], P\u00fctzchen/Bechlinghoven, Ramersdorf, [[Schwarzrheindorf/Vilich-Rheindorf]], Vilich, Vilich-M\u00fcldorf\n|-\n|Bonn\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Bonn1969.svg|35px|Wappen des Stadtbezirks Bonn]]\n| align=\"right\" |149.733\n|[[Auerberg]], Bonn-Castell (known until 2003 as Bonn-Nord), Bonn-Zentrum, Buschdorf, Dottendorf, Dransdorf, [[Endenich]], Graurheindorf, Gronau, Ippendorf, [[Kessenich (Bonn)|Kessenich]], Lessenich/Me\u00dfdorf, Nordstadt, Poppelsdorf, R\u00f6ttgen, S\u00fcdstadt, [[Tannenbusch]], \u00dcckesdorf, Venusberg, Weststadt\n|-\n|[[Hardtberg]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:Wappen-bezirk-hardtberg.svg|35px|Wappen des Stadtbezirks Hardtberg]]\n| align=\"right\" |33.360\n|Br\u00fcser Berg, Duisdorf, [[Hardth\u00f6he]], Lengsdorf\n|}\n\n=== Climate ===\nBonn has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'').

In about 12 BC, the [[Roman army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, \"Bonna\", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the [[1st century]] [[Anno Domini|AD]], the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, \"Fort Bonn\". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-[[5th century]]. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] kings until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The Sterntor (''star gate'') in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.\n\nTo date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the \"1st\", i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].\n\n[[File:Altes Rathaus Bonn.jpg|thumb|The ''Altes Rathaus'' (old town hall) as seen from the central market square. It was built in 1737 in [[Rococo|Rococo-style]].]]The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of [[Cologne]] and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, R\u00f6merstra\u00dfe). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne\u2013Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, ''Bonna'', grew into a sizeable Roman town. Bonn is shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].\n\nIn [[late antiquity]], much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Franks|Franci]] chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from [[Saint Boniface]] via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*Bonnifatia'', but this proved to be a myth.\n\n=== Middle Ages and Early Modern times ===\n[[File:University bonn at night.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1818, the [[University of Bonn]] counts [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], and German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] among its alumni.]]\nBetween the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|Siege of Bonn]] in 1689. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723\u20131761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Max Franz]] (ruled 1784\u20131794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].\n\nIn 1794, the city was seized by [[France|French]] troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.\n\n===20th century and time as the capital of West Germany===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] captured the city during the battle of 8\u20139 March 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 76.</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013859-0009, Bonn, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Charles de Gaulle.jpg|left|thumb|French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] on state visit to Bonn (1962), the capital of [[West Germany]] until [[German reunification]].]]\nFollowing the Second World War, Bonn was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone of occupation. Following the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former [[Cologne]] Mayor and a native of that area, Bonn became the ''de facto'' capital, officially designated the \"temporary seat of the Federal institutions,\" of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. However, the Bundestag, seated in Bonn's [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus]], affirmed [[Berlin]]'s status as the German capital. Bonn was chosen as the provisional capital and seat of government despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. However, Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in West Germany for reunification.\n\nIn 1949, the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] in Bonn drafted and adopted the current German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. As the political centre of West Germany, Bonn saw six [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellors]] and six [[President of Germany|Presidents]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn's time as the capital of West Germany is commonly referred to as the ''Bonn Republic,'' in contrast to the ''Berlin Republic'' which followed reunification in 1990.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schleichende Wende.

Today it serves as the President's secondary residence.]]\n[[German reunification]] in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn \u2014 a situation roughly analogous to that of the [[Netherlands]], where [[Amsterdam]] is the capital but [[the Hague]] is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and more ominously with [[Nazi Germany]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to [[Brussels]], headquarters of the [[European Economic Community]]. Former chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] caused considerable offence to the Western Allies during the debate by stating that [[France]] wouldn't have kept the seat of government at [[Vichy France|Vichy]] after Liberation.\n\nThe heated debate that resulted was settled by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338\u2013320,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110615-35655.html \"Bonn to Berlin move still controversial\"], ''The Local'', \"Published 11 June 2011\".

In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of Federal City ({{lang-de|Bundesstadt}}).
