The best known of these was his paternal aunt, [[Anna Letitia Barbauld]], a [[man of letters|woman of letters]] who wrote poetry and essays as well as early [[children's literature]]. His father, [[John Aikin|Dr John Aikin]], was a medical doctor, historian, and author. His grandfather, also called [[John Aikin (Unitarian)|John]] (1713\u20131780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with [[Warrington Academy]]. His sister [[Lucy Aikin|Lucy]] (1781\u20131864) was a historical writer. Their brother [[Charles Rochemont Aikin|Charles]] was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.\n\nArthur Aikin studied chemistry under [[Joseph Priestley]] in the [[New College at Hackney]], and gave attention to the practical applications of the science. In early life he was a [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian minister]] for a short time.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aikin, Arthur|volume=1|page=437}}</ref> Aikin lectured on chemistry at [[Guy's Hospital]] for thirty-two years. He became the President of the [[British Mineralogical Society]] in 1801 for five years up until 1806 when the Society merged with the [[Askesian Society]].<ref name=Knights-earth /> From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of the ''[[Annual Review (19th century)|Annual Review]]''. In 1805 Aiken also became a Proprietor of the [[London Institution]], which was officially founded in 1806. He was one of the founders of the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1807 and was its [[honorary secretary]] in 1812\u20131817. He also gave lectures in 1813 and 1814.<ref name=Knights-earth /> He contributed papers on the [[Telford and Wrekin|Wrekin]] and the [[Shropshire]] coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His ''Manual of Mineralogy'' was published in 1814. Later he became the paid Secretary of the [[Society of Arts]] and later was elected as a Fellow. He was founder of the [[Chemical Society]] of London in 1841, being its first Treasurer and, between 1843 and 1845, second President.\n\nIn order to support himself, outside of his work with the British Mineralogical Society, the London Institution and the Geological Society, Aiken worked as a writer, translator and lecturer to the public and to medical students at Guy's Hospital. His writing and journalism were useful for publicising foreign scientific news to the wider British public. He was also a member of the [[Linnean Society]] and in 1820 joined the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].\n\nHe was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgement<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and wide knowledge. Aikin never married, and died at [[Hoxton]] in London in 1854.<ref name=Knights-earth />\n\n==Publications==\n* ''Journal of a Tour through North Wales and Part of Shropshire with Observations in Mineralogy and Other Branches of Natural History'' (London, 1797)\n* ''A Manual of Mineralogy'' (1814; ed. 2, 1815)\n* ''A Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy'' (with his brother C.

Although the city of Akkad has not yet been identified on the ground, it is known from various textual sources. Among these is at least one text predating the reign of Sargon.

The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that\n{{quote|My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water.

While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.<ref name=Roux />}}\n\nLater claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an \"entu\" priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility, considering only a highly placed family can be made such a position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, Sargon was crowned king, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest.<ref>Samuel Noah Kramer, ''The Sumerians'', Chicago University Press, 1971, {{ISBN|0-226-45238-7}}</ref> Four times he invaded [[Syria]] and [[Canaan]], and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of \"the west\" to unite them with Mesopotamia \"into a single empire\".\n\nHowever, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and perhaps [[Cyprus]] (''Kaptara''); northward as far as the mountains (a later [[Hittite language|Hittite]] text asserts he fought the [[Hattians|Hattian]] king [[Nurdaggal]] of [[Burushanda]], well into [[Anatolia]]); eastward over [[Elam]]; and as far south as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] ([[Oman]])&nbsp;\u2014 a region over which he reigned for purportedly 56 years, though only four \"year-names\" survive. He consolidated his dominion over his territories by replacing the earlier opposing rulers with noble citizens of Akkad, his native city where loyalty would thus be ensured.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\n\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against [[Canaan]] and against [[Sarlak]], king of [[Gutian period|Gutium]]. He also boasted of having subjugated the \"four quarters\"&nbsp;\u2014 the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam), and the west ([[Amorites|Martu]]). Some of the earliest historiographic texts ([[Babylonian Chronicles|ABC 19, 20]]) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon (''Bab-ilu'') in its new location near Akkad.<ref>Dalley proposes that these sources may have originally referred to [[Sargon II]] of the Assyria rather than Sargon of Akkad.

He called himself \"The anointed priest of [[Anu]]\" and \"the great'' ensi'' of [[Enlil]]\" and his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], was installed as priestess to [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] at the temple in [[Ur]].\n\nTroubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states:\n{{quote|In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city) [but] he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army.}}\n\nIt refers to his campaign in \"Elam\", where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan and forced the vanquished to become his vassals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons, where revolts broke out during the nine-year reign of [[Rimush (Akkad)|Rimush]] (2278\u20132270 BC), who fought hard to retain the empire, and was successful until he was assassinated by some of his own courtiers. Rimush's elder brother, [[Manishtushu]] (2269\u20132255 BC) succeeded him. The latter seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him and took control over their pre-[[Arabs|Arab]] country, consisting of modern-day [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]]. Despite the success, like his brother he seems to have been assassinated in a palace conspiracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiebing Jr|first=H.

Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely and soon brought about [[famine]] and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king [[Ur-Nammu]] (2112\u20132095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.\n\nThe Sumerian King List, describing the Akkadian Empire after the death of Shar-kali-shari, states:\n{{quote|Who was king?

At 2200 BC, a marked increase in aridity and wind circulation, subsequent to a volcanic eruption, induced a considerable degradation of land-use conditions. After four centuries of urban life, this abrupt climatic change evidently caused abandonment of Tell Leilan, regional desertion, and collapse of the Akkadian empire based in southern Mesopotamia. Synchronous collapse in adjacent regions suggests that the impact of the abrupt climatic change was extensive\".<ref name=\"Weiss1993\" /> Peter B. deMenocal, has shown \"there was an influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the stream flow of the Tigris and Euphrates at this time, which led to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire\".<ref>deMenocal P.B., (2000), \"North Atlantic influence on Tigris\u2013Euphrates streamflow\" (''International Journal of Climatology'', Volume 20, Issue 8, pages 853\u2013863, 30 June 2000)</ref>\n\nExcavation at [[Tell Leilan]] suggests that this site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. [[Nomad]]ic herders such as the [[Amorite]]s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with Akkadian populations. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"Weiss1993\" />\n\nThis collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wall known as the \"Repeller of the Amorites\" between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler [[Shu-Suen|Shu-Sin]]. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depression occurred to re-establish [[Demography|demographic equilibrium]] with the less favourable climatic conditions.<ref>Christie, Peter (2008) ''The Curse of Akkad: Climate Upheavals that Rocked Human History'', Annick Press, pp. 31-48</ref><ref>[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/deMenocal.2001.pdf Cultural Responses to Climate Change During the Late Holocene], Peter B. deMenocal, ''Science'', 27 April 2001, Vol. 292 no. 5517 pp. 667\u2013673 {{doi|10.1126/science.1059287}}</ref><ref>\"[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/Cullen.et.al.2000.pdf Climate change and the collapse of the Akkadian empire:  Evidence from the deep sea]\"; ''Geology'' 28(4), April 2000.</ref>\n\nRichard Zettler has critiqued the drought theory, observing that the chronology of the Akkadian empire is very uncertain and that available evidence is not sufficient to show its economic dependence on the northern areas excavated by Weiss and others. He also criticizes Weiss for taking Akkadian writings literally to describe certain catastrophic events.<ref>Zettler (2003), pp. 18\u201321.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Joan Oates]], at Tell Brak the soil \"signal\" associated with the drought lies below the level of Naram-Sin's palace. However, evidence\n\n<blockquote>may suggest a tightening of Akkadian control following the Brak 'event', for example the construction of the heavily fortified 'palace' itself and the apparent introduction of greater numbers of Akkadian as opposed to local officials, perhaps a reflection of unrest in the countryside of the type that often follows some natural catastrophe.</blockquote> Furthermore, Brak remained occupied and functional after the fall of the Akkadians.<ref>J. Oates (2004), p.

Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.\n\nInitially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' =Great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ''\"\u00e9\"'' (= house) or \"palace\", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.\n\nAs Sargon extended his conquest from the \"Lower Sea\" (Persian Gulf), to the \"Upper Sea\" (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled \"the totality of the lands under heaven\", or \"from sunrise to sunset\", as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' became recognised as meaning \"lord of the universe\". Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrain]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history.  Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.\n\nWith Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called \"Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)\", but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.<ref>Leick, Gwendolyn (2001) \"Mesopotamia: Invention of the City\" (Penguin Books)</ref>\n\nOne strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.<ref>[http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in Of Pots and Plans.

Oates (2004), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnQ8W6AmCq0C&pg=PA10 10].</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe population of Akkad, like nearly all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centres: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as the \"Upper Country.\"\n\nSouthern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than {{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Before the Akkadian period the progressive [[soil salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and [[demography|demographic pressures]] were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.<ref>Thompson, William J. (2003), \"Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation,\" ''Journal of World Systems Research''</ref> It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.\n\nThe [[water table]] in this region was very high and replenished regularly\u2014by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October\u2014a period of food shortage\u2014under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has<ref>Leick Gwendolyn (2003), \"Mesopotamia: The invention of the city\" (Penguin)</ref> suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, \"Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival\u20145,400 warriors ate bread daily before him\".<ref>Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch. \"The institutions of urbanism\", 1990:179.</ref>\n\n[[File:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|thumb|right|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, {{circa|lk=no|2270}} BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]]\nHarvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. [[Nomad]]ic [[Amorites]] from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Stephen|title=The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed|date=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=9780500251478|page=89}}</ref> and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.\n\nAs a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the \"silver mountain\" (possibly the [[Taurus Mountains]]), the \"cedars\" of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of Magan, was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports. One tablet reads \"Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from Meluhha, the ships from Magan (and) the ships from Dilmun tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon the king prostrated himself before (the god) Dagan (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, namely Mari, Yarmuti, (and) Ebla, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain\".\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Art===\nIn art, there was a great emphasis on the kings of the dynasty, alongside much that continued earlier Sumerian art. Little architecture remains. In large works and small ones such as seals, the degree of realism was considerably increased,<ref>[[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort, Henri]], ''The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient'', Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0140561072}}, pp. 83\u201391</ref> but the seals show a \"grim world of cruel conflict, of danger and uncertainty, a world in which man is subjected without appeal to the incomprehensible acts of distant and fearful divinities who he must serve but cannot love.

Her known works include hymns to the goddess [[Inanna]], the ''Exaltation of Inanna'' and ''In-nin sa-gur-ra''. A third work, the ''Temple Hymns'', a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poet are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poet, princess, and priestess, she was a person who, according to William W Hallo, \"set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries\"<ref>Enheduanna, ''The Exaltation of Inanna''. Translated by William W. Hallo and J.J.A. Van Dijk,\nAms Pr Inc, 1979, {{ISBN|0-404-60263-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Exultation of Inanna'',\n{{bquote|Enheduanna depicts Inanna as disciplining mankind as a goddess of battle. She thereby unites the warlike Akkadian Ishtar's qualities to those of the gentler Sumerian goddess of love and fecundity. She likens Inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats. Then, in probably the most interesting part of the hymn, Enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories, establishing her credibility, and explaining her present plight. She has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of Ur and from Uruk and exiled to the steppe. She begs the moon god Nanna to intercede for her because the city of Uruk, under the ruler Lugalanne, has rebelled against Sargon. The rebel, Lugalanne, has even destroyed the temple Eanna, one of the greatest temples in the ancient world, and then made advances on his sister-in-law.<ref>Binkley, Roberta, ''The Importance of Enheduanna''</ref>}}\n\n===Curse of Akkad===\nLater material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Nara-Sin's attack upon the city of Nipper.

It is probable that the first collection of [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest \"year names\", whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from Sargon's reign.

According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sank many of their ships.\n\n[[File:Poseidon and Ajax.png|thumb|left|200px|Poseidon killing Ajax the Lesser]]\n\nAs he was [[Returns from Troy|returning from Troy]], Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{lang|grc|\u0393\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9}}).

He is also referred to as \"'''Telamonian Ajax'''\", \"'''Greater Ajax'''\", or \"'''Ajax the Great'''\", which distinguishes him from Ajax, son of Oileus ([[Ajax the Lesser]]).  In [[Etruscan mythology]], he is known as '''Aivas Tlamunus'''.\n\n==Family==\nAjax is the son of [[Telamon]], who was the son of [[Aeacus]] and grandson of [[Zeus]], and his first wife Periboea. He is the cousin of [[Achilles]], and is the elder [[Sibling|half-brother]] of [[Teucer]]. Many illustrious [[Athenians]], including [[Cimon]], [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], [[Alcibiades]] and the historian [[Thucydides]], traced their descent from Ajax. On an Etruscan tomb dedicated to Racvi Satlnei in Bologna (5th century BC) there is an inscription that says, \"aivastelmunsl\" which means \"family of Telamonian Ajax\".<ref>Papachristos, Maria. ''Miti e Leggende. Volume 5 of Miti e Leggende dell'antica Grecia''. Edizioni R.E.I. (2015). {{ISBN|9782372971621}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:The Belvedere Torso depicting Ajax.jpg|thumb|The [[Belvedere Torso]], a marble sculpture carved in the first Century BC depicting Ajax.]]\nIn Homer's ''Iliad'' he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. Known as the \"bulwark of the Achaeans\",<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+6.5 6.5].</ref> he was trained by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and Achilles' father [[Peleus]] and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by [[Heracles]], whom he was at the time training), at the same time as Achilles. He was described as fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence. Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the ''Iliad'', and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods (except for Agamemnon) who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength. Unlike [[Diomedes]], [[Agamemnon]], and [[Achilles]], Ajax appears as a mainly defensive warrior, instrumental in the defence of the Greek camp and ships and that of [[Patroclus]]' body. When the Trojans are on the offensive, he is often seen covering the retreat of the Achaeans. Significantly, while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem, Ajax has no [[aristeia]] depicting him on the offensive.\n\n===Trojan War===\nIn the ''Iliad'', Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with [[Hector]]. In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet Hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day. Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding Hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone,<ref>''[[Iliad]]'', 7.268&ndash;272.</ref> but Hector fights on until the [[herald]]s, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw, with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving Hector a purple sash and Hector giving Ajax his sharp sword.\n\nThe second fight between Ajax and Hector occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships. In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him.<ref>''[[Iliad]]'', 14.408&ndash;417.</ref> In Book 15, Hector is restored to his strength by [[Apollo]] and returns to attack the ships. Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the [[Troy|Trojan]] armies virtually single-handedly. In Book 16, Hector and Ajax duel once again.  Hector then disarms Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring Hector. Hector and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war. Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including [[Phorcys (Trojan War)|Phorcys]].\n\nAjax often fought in tandem with his brother Teucer, known for his skill with the bow.  Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as Teucer stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.\n\nAchilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon. In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, [[Odysseus]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight. Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.\n\nWhen Patroclus is killed, Hector tries to steal his body. Ajax, assisted by [[Menelaus]], succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans have already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor. Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial.  According to [[Hyginus]], in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.<ref>Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html 114].</ref>\n\n====Death====\n[[File:Ajax (Carstens).jpg|thumb|''Sorrowful Ajax'' (Asmus Jacob Carstens, ca. 1791)]]\nAs the ''Iliad'' comes to a close, Ajax and the majority of other Greek warriors are alive and well. When Achilles dies, killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] (with help from Apollo), Ajax and Odysseus are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion, Patroclus.<ref>Homer,  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+24.2''Odyssey''].</ref> Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to recover the body and carry it to the ships, while Odysseus fights off the Trojans.<ref>Arctinus Miletus, \"Aethiopis\"</ref> After the burial, each claims Achilles' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts. After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on [[Mount Olympus]] by the smith-god [[Hephaestus]]. It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor. Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from Hector, and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', translated by Rolfe Humphries (Indianapolis: Indiana University, 1955), Book XIII, pp. 305\u2013309)</ref>  However, Odysseus proves to be more eloquent, and with the aid of Athena, the council gives him the armor. Ajax, \"Unconquered\", and furious, becomes crazed and slaughters the Achaians' herds of captured livestock, believing them to be his enemies through a trick of Athena. Unable to deal with this dual dishonor, he falls upon his own sword, \"conquered by his [own] sorrow,\" and commits suicide.<ref>''Metamorphoses'', trans. Humphries, p.&nbsp;318</ref><ref>Lesches of Mitylene, \"The Little Iliad (Ilias Mikra)\"</ref>  \nThe [[Belvedere Torso]], a marble torso now in the Vatican Museums, is considered to depict Ajax \"in the act of contemplating his [[Suicide of Ajax vase|suicide]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/MPCs/MPCs_Sala06_01.html|title=The Belvedere Torso; Cat. 1192|publisher=[[Vatican Museums]]|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Sophocles' play ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', a famous retelling of Ajax's demise, after the armor is awarded to Odysseus Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and Menelaus. Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision, and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon. When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor, and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame. He does so with the same sword which Hector gave him when they exchanged presents.<ref>''[[Iliad]],'' 7.303</ref> From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name ''Ai,'' also expressive of lament.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.35.4</ref> His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the [[Rhoiteion#The Tomb of Ajax|Rhoetean]] promontory at the entrance of the [[Hellespont]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ajax (son of Telamon)|display=Ajax |volume=1 |page=452}}</ref>\n\nAjax's half-brother Teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or famous weapons back. Teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence. He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home, the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] off the coast of Athens.\n\nHomer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over Achilles' armor; when Odysseus visits [[Hades]], he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into [[Erebus]].\n\nLike Achilles, he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html Description of Greece]'' iii. 19. \u00a7 13</ref> Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the [[tutelary deity|tutelary hero]] of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called ''Aianteia'' was celebrated in his honour.<ref>Pausanias 1.35</ref> At this festival a couch was set up, on which the [[panoply]] of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman [[Lectisternium]]. The identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion [[Solon]] is said to have inserted a line in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (2.557\u2013558),<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=0AE5CEA2E5E28FE965FF802C44870114?doc=Hom.+Il.+2.557 2.557&ndash;258].</ref> for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island. Ajax then became an [[Attica|Attic]] hero; he was worshiped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe ''Aiantis'' was named after him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter, appeared on the beach near [[Sigeion]], on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Ajax suicide BM F480.jpg|The suicide of Ajax.

The multi-story structure covers {{convert|750|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and had perhaps 30 rooms.

He first appeared as leader of a mixed band of [[Goths]] and allied peoples, who invaded [[Thrace]] in 391 but were stopped by the half-[[Vandal]] Roman General [[Stilicho]]. In 394, he led a Gothic force of 20,000 that helped [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] defeat the [[Franks|Frankish]] usurper [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] at the [[Battle of Frigidus]]. Despite sacrificing around 10,000 of his men, Alaric received little recognition from the emperor. Disappointed, he left the army, was elected [[reiks]] of the [[Visigoths]] in 395 and marched toward [[Constantinople]] until he was diverted by Roman forces. He then moved southward into [[Greece]], where he sacked [[Piraeus]] (the port of [[Athens]]) and destroyed [[Corinth]], [[Megara]], [[Argos]] and [[Sparta]]. Nonetheless, the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|Eastern emperor]] [[Arcadius]] appointed Alaric [[magister militum]] (\"master of the soldiers\") in [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]].\n\nIn 401 Alaric invaded Italy, but was defeated by [[Stilicho]] at [[Battle of Pollentia|Pollentia]] (modern Pollenza) on April{{nbsp}}6, 402. A second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Verona (402)|Battle of Verona]], although he did force the [[Roman Senate]] to pay a large subsidy to the Visigoths. During [[Radagaisus]]' Italian invasion in 406, he remained idle in [[Illyria]]. In 408, [[Western Emperor]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] ordered the execution of Stilicho and his family, in response to rumors that the general had made a deal with Alaric. Honorius then incited the Roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of [[foederati]] Goths serving in the Roman military. The Gothic soldiers then defected to Alaric, increasing the size of his force to around 30,000 men, and joined his march on Rome to avenge their murdered families.<ref name=Heather>{{cite book |last=Heather |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Heather|date=2006 |title=The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History |publisher= Pan Books|page= 224|isbn=978-0-330-49136-5}}</ref>\n\nMoving swiftly along [[Roman road]]s, Alaric sacked the cities of [[Aquileia]] and [[Cremona]] and ravaged the lands along the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The Visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to Rome in 408, but eventually the Senate granted him a substantial subsidy. In addition, he forced the Senate to liberate all 40,000 [[Goths|Gothic]] slaves in Rome. Honorius, however, refused to appoint Alaric as the commander of the Western Roman Army, and in 409 the Visigoths again surrounded Rome. Alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming [[Priscus Attalus|Attalus]] [[Western Emperor]]. Attalus appointed him [[magister utriusque militiae]] (\"master of both services\"), but refused to allow him to send an army into [[Africa]]. Negotiations with Honorius broke down, after which Alaric deposed Attalus in the summer of 410 and besieged Rome for the third time. Allies within the capital opened the gates for him on August{{nbsp}}24, and for three days his troops [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]]. Although the Visigoths plundered Rome, they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings. Having abandoned a plan to occupy [[Sicily]] and [[North Africa]] after the destruction of his fleet in a storm, Alaric died as the Visigoths were marching northward.\n\n==Early life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Alarich steel engraving.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Portrait of Alaric in C. Strahlheim, ''Das Welttheater'', 4. Band, Frankfurt a.M., 1836]]\nBorn on [[Peuce Island]] at the mouth of the [[Danube Delta]] in present-day [[Romania]], Alaric belonged to the noble [[Balti dynasty]] of the [[Thervingi|Tervingian]] [[Goths]]. The Goths suffered setbacks against the [[Huns]], made a mass migration across the [[Danube]], and fought a [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|war with Rome]]. Alaric was probably a child during this period.\n\n==In Roman service==\nDuring the fourth century, the [[Roman emperors]] commonly employed ''[[foederati]]'': [[irregular military|irregular troops]] under Roman command, but organized by tribal structures. To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money, emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes.  The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths, who in 382 (376 in some sources), had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries, keeping a large degree of autonomy.\n\nIn 394 Alaric served as a leader of ''foederati'' under [[Theodosius I]] in the campaign which crushed the usurper [[Eugenius]]. As the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the [[Julian Alps]], Alaric probably learned the weakness of [[Italy|Italy's]] natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\nTheodosius died in 395, leaving the Empire to be divided between his two sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], the former taking [[Byzantine Empire|the eastern]] and the latter [[Western Roman Empire|the western portion]] of the Empire.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}} Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]]. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho]]. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts.\n\nAccording to [[Edward Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies. He was denied the promotion, however. Among the Visigoths settled in Lower [[Moesia]] (now part of Bulgaria and Romania), the situation was ripe for rebellion. They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus. According to rumour, exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. This, combined with their post-battle rewards, prompted them to raise Alaric \"on a shield\" and proclaim him king; according to [[Jordanes]], a 6th-century Roman bureaucrat of Gothic origin who later turned his hand to history, both the new king and his people decided \"rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others.\"{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\n==In Greece==\n[[File:Ludwig Thiersch - Alaric \u00e0 Ath\u00e8nes.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Alaric in Athens by [[Ludwig Thiersch]], 1894]]\nAlaric struck first at the eastern empire. He marched to the neighborhood of [[Constantinople]] but, finding himself unable to undertake a siege, retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through [[Thessaly]] and the unguarded pass of [[Thermopylae]] into [[Greece]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\nThe armies of the eastern empire were occupied with [[Huns|Hunnic]] incursions in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]]. Instead, Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person, which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinus was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to [[Claudian]], Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius - influenced by Rufinus - to leave [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Soon after, Rufinus' own soldiers hacked him to death. Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch Chamberlain [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]].\n\nRufinus' death and Stilicho's departure gave free rein to Alaric's movements; he ravaged [[Attica]] but spared [[Athens]], which capitulated at once to the conqueror. In 396, he wiped out the last remnants of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Mysteries at Eleusis]] in Attica, ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the [[Bronze Age]]. Then he penetrated into the [[Peloponnesus]] and captured its most famous cities\u2014[[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]], and [[History of Sparta|Sparta]]\u2014selling many of their inhabitants into slavery.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=470}}\n\nHere, however, his victorious career suffered a serious setback. In 397 Stilicho crossed the sea to Greece and succeeded in trapping the Goths in the mountains of [[Pholoe]], on the borders of [[Elis]] and [[Arcadia]] in the peninsula. From there Alaric escaped with difficulty, and not without some suspicion of connivance by Stilicho, who supposedly had again received orders to depart. Alaric then crossed the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and marched with the plunder of [[Greece]] northward to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|pp=470-471}} Here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him ''magister militum per Illyricum'', giving him the Roman command he had desired, as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals.\n\n==First invasion of Italy==\n<!-- NON EXISTANT TEMPLATE {{Campaignbox Gothic War (401\u2013403)}} -->\nIt was probably in 401 that Alaric made his first invasion of Italy, originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to Rome. Alaric had a fascination for the 'golden age' of Rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him 'Alaricus'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William N. |last=Bayless |title=The Visigothic Invasion of Italy in 401 |journal=The Classical Journal |volume=72 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=65\u201367 |jstor=3296883 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Marcel |last=Brion |title=Alaric the Goth |location= |publisher=R. M. McBride & Co. |year=1930 }}</ref> Supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise. Some lines of the Roman poet [[Claudian]] inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a [[sacred grove]], \"Break off all delays, Alaric. This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy; thou shalt penetrate to the city.\" But the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time. After spreading desolation through northern [[Italy]] and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by [[Stilicho]] at [[Pollentia]], today in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]. The battle which followed on April 6, 402 (coinciding with Easter), was a costly victory for Rome, but it effectively halted the Goths' progress.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nStilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival. Alaric, too, was outwardly a Christian, though an [[Arianism|Arian]] rather than [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Orthodox]], though he continued to practice the pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing Christian ritual practices. He had trusted to the sanctity of Easter for immunity from attack.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nAlaric's wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle; it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children, which gave his invasion of Italy the character of a [[human migration]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nAfter another defeat before [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], Alaric left Italy, probably in 403. He had not \"penetrated to the city\" but his invasion of Italy had produced important results. It caused the imperial residence to be transferred from [[Milan]] to [[Ravenna]], and necessitated the withdrawal of [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|Legio XX ''Valeria Victrix'']] from Britain.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\n==Second invasion of Italy==\nAlaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent, [[Stilicho]]. By 407, the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war. Stilicho actually proposed using Alaric's troops to enforce Honorius' claim to the [[prefecture]] of Illyricum. The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the \"expenses of [[mobilization]]\". The sum which he named was a large one, 4,000&nbsp;pounds of gold. Under strong pressure from Stilicho, the Roman Senate consented to promise its payment.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nBut three months later, Stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on Honorius' orders. In the unrest that followed throughout Italy, the wives and children of the foederati were slain.<ref name=Heather/> Consequently, these 30,000 men flocked to Alaric's camp, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September 408, stood before the walls of [[Rome]] (now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender) and began a strict blockade.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nNo blood was shed this time; Alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon. When the ambassadors of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], entreating for peace, tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish, he laughed and gave his celebrated answer: \"The thicker the hay, the easier mowed!\" After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silken tunics, 3,000 hides dyed scarlet, and 3,000 pounds of pepper.<ref name=\"Nor\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 134</ref> Along came 40,000 freed [[Goths|Gothic]] slaves. Thus ended Alaric's first siege of Rome.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}} The combined value of the gold and silver in pure coinage would have been worth 7000 pounds in gold or 1.028 million solidi\u2014enough to provide the basic needs of 200,000 adults and children for a year or equip 30,000 Roman infantry and cavalry.\n\n===Second siege of Rome===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by the Visigoths on 24 August 410 by JN Sylvestre 1890.jpg|thumb|[[Sack of Rome (410)|The Sack of Rome]] by the Visigoths on 24 August 410 by [[Joseph-No\u00ebl Sylvestre|J-N Sylvestre]] (1890)]]\nThroughout his career, Alaric's primary goal was not to undermine the Empire, but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the Empire's borders. His demands were certainly grand: the concession of a block of territory 200&nbsp;miles long by 150 wide between the [[Danube]] and the Gulf of [[Venice]] (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army. As outrageous as his terms were, the emperor would have been well-advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of [[Ravenna]]. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of [[Rome]] in 409, came to terms with the Senate. With their consent, he set up a rival emperor, the prefect of the city, a Greek named [[Priscus Attalus]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\n===Third siege of Rome===\n{{main|Sack of Rome (410)}}\nAlaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius. These negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another Goth, [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus]], an [[Amali]], and therefore hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house. Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward, and began his third siege of Rome. Apparently, defence was impossible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; surprise is a more likely explanation. However, this may be\u2014for our information at this point of the story is meagre\u2014on August 24, 410, Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the [[Porta Salaria]] on the northeast of the city. Rome, for so long victorious against its enemies, was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}}\n\nThe contemporary [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastics]] recorded with wonder many instances of the Visigoths' clemency: Christian churches saved from ravage; protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and Christians who took refuge therein; vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling, spared because they \"belonged to St. Peter\"; at least one case in which a beautiful Roman matron appealed, not in vain, to the better feelings of the Gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor. But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the [[Gardens of Sallust]], which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1911|p=471}} The [[Basilica Aemilia]] in the [[Roman Forum]] did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric: the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor. The pagan emperors' tombs of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] and [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were rifled and the ashes scattered.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Death and funeral===\n[[Image:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The burial of Alaric in the bed of the [[Busento River]]. 1895 wood engraving.]]\n\nAlaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into [[Calabria]]. He desired to invade Africa, which, thanks to its grain, had become the key to holding Italy. But a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned.

Brill, 1970), pp. 17f</ref>\n\nThe earliest documented event in Alaric's reign concerned providing refuge to [[Syagrius]], the former ruler of the [[Domain of Soissons]] (in what is now northwestern [[France]]) who had been defeated by [[Clovis I]], King of the Franks. According to [[Gregory of Tours]]' account, Alaric was intimidated by Clovis into surrendering Syagrius to Clovis; Gregory then adds that \"the Goths are a timorous race.\" The [[Franks]] then imprisoned Syagrius, and once his control over Syagrius' former kingdom was secure, Clovis had him beheaded.<ref name=Gregory-27>Gregory of Tours, ''Decem Libri Historiarum'', II.27; translated by Lewis Thorpe, ''History of the Franks'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 139</ref> However, Wolfram points out that at the time \"Clovis got no farther than the Seine; only after several more years did the Franks succeed in occupying the rest of the Gallo-Roman buffer state north of the [[Loire]].\" Any threat of war Clovis could make would only be effective if they were neighbors; \"it is nowhere written that Syagrius was handed over in 486 or 487.\"<ref name=Wolfram-191/>\n\n[[File:Alarico II.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's imagining of Alaric II in an illustration at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]]]\n\nDespite Frankish advances in the years that followed, Alaric was not afraid to take the military initiative when it presented itself. In 490, Alaric assisted his fellow Gothic king, [[Theodoric the Great]], in his conquest of [[Italy]] by dispatching an army to raise [[Odoacer]]'s siege of [[Pavia]], where Theodoric had been trapped.<ref>Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', pp. 281f</ref> Then when the Franks attacked the [[Burgundians]] in the decade after 500, Alaric assisted the ruling house, and according to Wolfram the victorious Burgundian king [[Gundobad]] ceded [[Avignon]] to Alaric.<ref>Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 291</ref> By 502 Clovis and Alaric met on an island in the Loire near [[Amboise]] for face-to-face talks, which led to a peace treaty.\n\nIn 506, the [[Visigoths]] captured the city of [[Dertosa]] in the [[Ebro valley]]. There they captured the [[Roman usurper]] [[Peter (usurper)|Peter]] and had him executed.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711''.

Despite the diplomatic intervention of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] and father-in-law of Alaric, Clovis led his followers into Visigothic territory. Alaric was forced by his magnates to meet Clovis in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] (summer 507) near Poitiers; there the Goths were defeated and Alaric slain, according to Gregory of Tours, by Clovis himself.<ref>Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', pp. 292f</ref>\n\nThe most serious consequence of this battle was not the loss of their possessions in [[Gaul]] to the Franks; with Ostrogothic help, much of the Gallic territory was recovered, Herwig Wolfram notes, perhaps as far as [[Toulouse]].<ref>Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 245</ref> Nor was it the loss of the royal treasury at Toulouse, which Gregory of Tours writes Clovis took into his possession.<ref name=Gregory-27/> As Peter Heather notes, the Visigothic kingdom was thrown into disarray \"by the death of its king in battle.\"<ref>Peter Heather, ''The Goths'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 215</ref> Alaric's heirs were his eldest son, the illegitimate [[Gesalec]], and his younger son, the legitimate [[Amalaric]] who was still a child. Gesalec proved incompetent, and in 511 King Theodoric assumed the throne of the kingdom ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric\u2014Heather uses the word \"hijacked\" to describe his action. Although Amalaric eventually became king in his own right, the political continuity of the Visigothic kingdom was broken; \"Amalaric's succession was the result of new power structures, not old ones,\" as Heather describes it. With Amalaric's death in 531, the Visigothic kingdom entered an extended period of unrest which lasted until [[Leovigild]] assumed the throne in 568.<ref>Heather, ''The Goths'', p. 277</ref>\n\n== Ability as king ==\nIn religion Alaric was an [[Arianism|Arian]], like all the early Visigothic nobles, but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father Euric toward the [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and authorized them to hold in 506 the council of [[Agde]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alaric II.|volume=1|page=472}}</ref> He was on uneasy terms with the Catholic bishops of [[Arelate]] (modern Arles) as epitomized in the career of the Frankish [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]], who was appointed bishop in 503. Caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]], whose king had married the sister of Clovis, to assist the Burgundians capture Arles.

In 1263 [[Pope Urban IV]] relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the [[eighth Crusade]] in German-speaking countries.<ref name=Markus>[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/albert-great/ F\u00fchrer, Markus, \"Albert the Great\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),]</ref>  After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties. In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for \"the big verdict\" (der Gro\u00dfe Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas, whose death in 1274 grieved Albert (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).\n\nAlbert was a scientist, philosopher, astrologer, theologian, spiritual writer, ecumenist, and diplomat. Under the auspices of Humbert of Romans, Albert molded the curriculum of studies for all Dominican students, introduced Aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Plotinus]]. Indeed, it was the thirty years of work done by Aquinas and himself that allowed for the inclusion of Aristotelian study in the curriculum of Dominican schools.\n\nAfter suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in the Dominican convent in Cologne, [[Germany]]. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican St. [[Andreas]] Church in Cologne.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de/st_andreas_koeln/albertusMagnus/ |title=Zeittafel |publisher=Gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> Although his body was discovered to be [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] at the first exhumation three years after his death, at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained.<ref name=\"Cruz 1977\">{{cite book |title=The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati |last=Carroll Cruz |first=Joan |publisher=TAN Books |location=[[Charlotte, NC]] |year=1977 |isbn=0-89555-066-0}}</ref>\n\nAlbert was [[beatified]] in 1622. He was [[canonized]] and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on December 16, 1931, by [[Pope Pius XI]]<ref name=Markus /> and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St. Albert's [[feast day]] is November 15.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Albertus Magnus monument at the [[University of Cologne]]]]\n\nAlbert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [[logic]], [[theology]], [[botany]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[alchemy]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], [[phrenology]], [[justice]], [[law]], [[friendship]], and [[love]]. He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.<ref name=Kennedy />\n\nHis principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'' in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.\n\nAlbert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master. Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.<ref name=Markus />\n\n[[File:Firenze, alberto magno, de animalibus, 1450-1500 ca. cod fiesolano 67, 01.JPG|thumb|250px|''De animalibus'' (1450\u20131500 ca., cod. fiesolano 67, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]])]]\n\nAlbert's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise \"De falconibus\" (later inserted in the larger work, ''De Animalibus'', as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of: a) the differences between the [[birds of prey]] and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of [[falcon]]s; c) the way of preparing them for the [[Hunting|hunt]]; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons.<ref>An Smets, \"Le r\u00e9ception en langue vulgaire du \"De falconibus\" d'Albert le Grand,\" in: ''Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate'', ed. Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, and Richard Utz (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2002), pp. 189\u201399.</ref> His scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries' bestowing upon him the honourable surname ''Doctor Universalis.''\n\nIn ''De Mineralibus'' Albert claims, \"The aim of natural philosophy (science) is not simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature.\" While Aristotelianism greatly influenced Albert's view on nature and philosophy, he investigated Aristotle's ideas critically, judged many of them to be in error, and emphasized that experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations.<ref name=Kennedy />\n\n==Alchemy==\n[[File:Liebig Company Trading Card Ad 01.12.003 front.tif|thumb|left|250px| Albertus Magnus, Chimistes Celebres, [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] Trading Card, 1929]]\n\nIn the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and magician. \"Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the ''Secreta Alberti'' or the ''Experimenta Alberti'', were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association.\"<ref>Katz, David A., \"An Illustrated History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry\", 1978</ref> On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, ''De mineralibus'', he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be.<ref>Georg Wieland, \"Albert der Grosse.  Der Entwurf einer eigenst\u00e4ndigen Philosophie,\" Philosophen des Mittelalters (Darmstadt: Primus, 2000) 124-39.</ref> A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include ''Metals and Materials''; the ''Secrets of Chemistry''; the ''Origin of Metals''; the ''Origins of Compounds'', and a ''Concordance ''which is a collection of ''Observations on the [[philosopher's stone]]''; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of ''Theatrum Chemicum''.<ref>Walsh, John, ''The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.'' 1907:46 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_rofAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA46&dq=albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#PRA2-PA46,M1 available online]).</ref> He is credited with the discovery of the element [[arsenic]]<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks451-3\">{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}</ref> and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [[silver nitrate]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Michael W. |author2=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at The Florida State University |title=Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics and You&nbsp;\u2014 Timeline&nbsp;\u2014 Albertus Magnus |publisher=The Florida State University |date=2003-08-01 |url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330045629/http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |archivedate=2010-03-30 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Szabadv\u00e1ry |first=Ferenc |title=History of analytical chemistry |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1992 |location= |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53APqy0KDaQC |isbn=2-88124-569-2}}</ref> He did believe that stones had occult properties, as he related in his work ''De mineralibus''. However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.\n\nAccording to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation.\"<ref>Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. {{ISBN|1-84327-087-0}}.</ref> Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.\n\n==Astrology==\n\nAlbert was deeply interested in [[astrology]], as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli<ref>Paola Zambelli, \"The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma\" Dordrecht.</ref> and Scott Hendrix.<ref name=\":1\" /> Throughout the Middle Ages&nbsp;\u2013and well into the early modern period\u2013 astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm (the latter being the cosmos itself). It was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth. With this worldview, it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albert argued that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts.<ref name=\":1\">Scott E. Hendrix, How Albert the Great's Speculum Astronomiae Was Interpreted and Used by Four Centuries of Readers (Lewiston: 2010), 44-46.</ref> The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''. However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early ''De natura boni'' to his last work, the ''Summa theologiae''.<ref>Hendrix, 195.</ref>\n\n==Matter and form==\nAlbert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form, he referred to it as ''quod est'' and ''quo est''. Albert also believed that God alone is the absolute ruling entity. Albert's version of [[hylomorphism]] is very similar to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine.\n\n==Music==\nAlbert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He rejected the idea of \"[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]\" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.\n\n==Metaphysics of morals==\nBoth of his early treatises, ''De natura boni'' and ''De bono'', start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as ''bonum naturae''. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p. 93</ref> Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.\n\n==Natural law==\nAlbert devoted the last tractatus of ''De Bono'' to a theory of justice and [[natural law]]. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. God legislates and divine authority is supreme. Up until his time, it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.207</ref>\n\n==Friendship==\n\nAlbert mentions friendship in his work, ''De bono'', as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of ''Tractatus II''. Later in his life he published ''Super Ethica''.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.242</ref> With his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from [[Cicero]], who writes, \"friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love\". Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement.<ref>Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.243</ref> Albert calls this harmony, ''consensio'', itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (''utile''), the pleasurable (''delectabile'') and the authentic or unqualified good (''honestum''). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels, namely friendship based on usefulness (''amicitia utilis''), friendship based on pleasure (''amicitia delectabilis''), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (''amicitia honesti''; ''amicitia quae fundatur super honestum'').<ref>Cunningham, Stanley.

During his reign the Lombards ended their [[migration period|migrations]] by settling in Italy, the northern part of which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting effect on Italy and the [[Pannonian Basin]]; in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the [[Gepids]] and his departure from [[Pannonia]] ended the dominance there of the [[Germanic peoples]].\n\nThe period of Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia following the death of his father, [[Audoin]], was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping to take advantage of the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]].\n\nAfter gathering a large coalition of peoples, Alboin crossed the [[Julian Alps]] in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly took control of most of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and [[Liguria]]. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, [[Milan]]. [[Pavia]] offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to [[Tuscany]], but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.\n\nAlboin was assassinated on June 28, 572, in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother, [[Helmichis]], with the support of Alboin's wife, [[Rosamund (Gepid)|Rosamund]], daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected [[Cleph]] as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to [[Ravenna]] under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the [[Elbe]] to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.\n\n== Father's rule ==\nThe Lombards under King [[Wacho]] had migrated towards the east into Pannonia, taking advantage of the difficulties facing the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy following the death of its founder, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] in 526. Wacho's death in about 540 brought his son [[Walthari]] to the throne, but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by Alboin's father, Audoin, of the [[Gausian dynasty|Gausian]] clan. Seven years later Walthari died, giving Audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning [[Lethings]].<ref>Jarnut 1995, pp. 16\u201318</ref>\n\nAlboin was probably born in the 530s in Pannonia,<ref name=\"PLRE3\">Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Alboin'', pp. 38\u201340</ref> the son of Audoin and his wife, [[Rodelinda (6th century)|Rodelinda]]. She may have been the niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]].<ref>Rovagnati 2003, pp. 28\u201329</ref><ref>Amory 2003, p. 462</ref> Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian.<ref>Wickham 1989, pp. 29\u201330</ref> Alboin took as his first wife the Christian [[Chlothsind]], daughter of the [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Chlothar I|Chlothar]]. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler [[Theudebald]] in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option.<ref>Jarnut 1995, p. 21</ref><ref name=\"DBI\">Bertolini 1960, pp. 34\u201338.</ref> However, the ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/>\n\nAlboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the [[Battle of Asfeld]] (552), he killed [[Turismod]], son of the Gepid king [[Thurisind]], in a victory that resulted in the Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers.<ref>Rovagnati 2003, p. 28</ref> After the battle, according to a tradition reported by [[Paul the Deacon]], to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref>Ausenda 1999, p. 433</ref> [[Walter Goffart]] believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of an [[epic poetry|epic poem]].<ref>Goffart 1988, p. 387</ref>\n\n== Reign in Pannonia ==\n\nAlboin came to the throne after the death of his father, sometime between 560 and 565.<ref name=\"DBI\"/> As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan.<ref>Jarnut 1995, p. 25</ref><ref>Wolfram 1997, p. 284</ref> Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by [[Cunimund]], Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian [[Menander Protector]] places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian [[Walter Pohl]].<ref name=\"Pohl96\">Pohl 1997, p. 96</ref>\n\nAn account of the war by the Byzantine [[Theophylact Simocatta]] sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, claiming it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter [[Rosamund (Gepid)|Rosamund]], that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', where she was captured only after the death of her father.<ref name=\"WG392\"/><ref>Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Cunimundus'', p. 364</ref> The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of [[Sirmium]], the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor [[Justin II]] sent his son-in-law [[Baduarius]] as ''[[magister militum]]'' (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"Pohl96\"/><ref>Rovagnati 2003, p. 30</ref><ref name=\"JJ22\">Jarnut 1995, p. 22</ref><ref>Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Baduarius (2)'', pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\nFaced with the possibility of annihilation, Alboin made an alliance in 566 with the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] under [[Bayan I]], at the expense of some tough conditions: the Avars demanded a tenth of the Lombards' cattle, half of the war booty, and on the war's conclusion all of the lands held by the Gepids. The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref>Pohl 1997, pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 567 the allies made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the northwest while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the [[Timi\u015f River|Tibiscus]] and [[Danube River|Danube]] rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the ''Origo''. The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"JJ22\"/><ref>Rovagnati 2003, pp. 30\u201331</ref> Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids.<ref name=\"SG20\">Gasparri 1990, p. 20</ref> The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.<ref>Curta 2001, p. 204</ref>\n\n== Preparations and departure from Pannonia ==\n\nDespite his success against the Gepids, Alboin had failed to greatly increase his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars.<ref name=\"JJ29\">Jarnut 1995, p. 29</ref> Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, even though there are indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"JM152\">Moorhead 2005, p. 152</ref> Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the [[Three-Chapter Controversy]] sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, [[Narses]], was recalled.<ref>Christie 1998, p. 60</ref> Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty,<ref name=\"JJ29\"/><ref name=\"SG25\">Gasparri 1990, p. 25</ref> assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including [[Heruli]], [[Suebi]], [[Gepids]], [[Thuringii]], [[Bulgars]], [[Sarmatians]], the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the [[Saxons]], of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King [[Sigebert I|Sigebert]], and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"HS82\">Schutz 2002, p. 82</ref>\n\nThe precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. [[Neil Christie]] considers 150,000\u2013500,000 to be a realistic size, a number which would make the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of Italy. J\u00f6rg Jarnut proposes 100,000\u2013150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in ''Die Langobarden'' estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.<ref name=\"SG25\"/><ref name=\"HS82\"/><ref name=\"NC634\">Christie 1998, pp. 63\u201364</ref><ref name=\"JJ30\">Jarnut 1995, p. 30</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Christie|first1=Neil|title=The Lombards: the Ancient Longobards|date=1995|publisher=Blackwell|pages=38\u201341}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vipava valley from Nanos.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photo showing a valley and a mountain|The Vipava Valley in Slovenia, through which Alboin led the Lombards into Italy]]As a precautionary move Alboin strengthened his alliance with the Avars, signing what Paul calls a ''foedus perpetuum'' (\"perpetual treaty\") and what is referred to in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani]]'' as a ''pactum et foedus amicitiae'' (\"pact and treaty of friendship\"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200&nbsp;years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.<ref>Pohl 1997, p. 98</ref><ref name=\"HW286\">Wolfram 1997, p. 286</ref><ref>Jarnut 1995, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nA further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition,<ref name=\"JJ30\"/><ref>Whitby 2001, p. 91</ref> it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as ''[[foederati]]'', to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.<ref name=\"JM152\"/><ref>Christie 1998, pp. 60\u201363</ref><ref>Pohl 1997, pp. 98\u201399</ref><ref name=\"RC186\">Collins 1991, p. 186</ref>\n\n=== March to Italy ===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"This Albuin led into Italy the Langobards who were invited by Narses (chief) of the secretaries. And Albuin, king of the Langobards, moved out of Pannonia in the month of April after Easter in the first indiction.

The decision to combine the departure with a Christian celebration can be understood in the context of Alboin's recent conversion to [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]], as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court.<ref name=\"JM152\"/><ref name=\"SP43\">Palmieri 1996, pp. 43\u201344</ref> The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as ''foederati''.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref>Gasparri 1990, pp. 24\u201325</ref> It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.<ref name=\"JM152\"/>\n\nThe season chosen for leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.<ref name=\"HW286\"/><ref name=\"RC186\"/>\n\nThe road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the [[Ptuj|Poetovio]] \u2013 [[Celje|Celeia]] \u2013 [[Emona]] \u2013 [[Cividale del Friuli|Forum Iulii]] route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], but it was probably only in 569 that the [[Julian Alps]] were crossed at the [[Vipava Valley]]; the eyewitness [[Secundus of Non]] gives the date as May 20 or 21.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"SG25\"/><ref name=\"NC634\"/> The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and J\u00f6rg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.<ref name=\"JJ30\"/><ref name=\"SP43\"/>\n\n== Invasion of Italy ==\n\n=== Foundation of the Duchy of Friuli ===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When Alboin without any hindrance had thence entered the territories of Venetia [...] \u2013 that is, the limits of the city or rather of the fortress of Forum Julii (Cividale) \u2013 he began to consider to whom he should especially commit the first of the provinces that he had taken.

The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty, and the border forts may well have been left unmanned. What seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated. This agrees with Paul the Deacon's narrative, who speaks of a Lombard takeover in [[Friuli]] \"without any hindrance\".<ref>Christie 1998, pp. 73, 76</ref>\n\nThe first town to fall into the Lombards' hands was [[Cividale del Friuli|Forum Iulii]] (Cividale del Friuli), the seat of the local ''magister militum''.<ref name=\"DBI\"/> Alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the [[Duchy of Friuli]] and made his nephew and [[shield bearer]], [[Gisulf I of Friuli|Gisulf]], [[Duke (Lombard)|duke]] of the region, with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those ''[[Fara (Lombard)|farae]]'', or clans, that he preferred.<ref name=\"JJ30\"/><ref>Christie 1998, pp. 93\u201394</ref><ref name=\"HW2878\">Wolfram 1997, pp. 287\u2013288</ref>\n\nAlboin's decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the ''[[comes]] [[civitas|civitatis]]'' (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (''comes'') to duke (''dux'') and from county (''comitatus'') to duchy (''ducatus'') also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy.<ref name=\"HW2878\"/> The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.<ref>Christie 1998, p. 77</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Milan ===\nFrom Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached [[Aquileia]], the most important road junction in the northeast,<ref name=\"HW288\">Wolfram 1997, p. 288</ref> and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the [[List of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]] [[Paulinus I of Aquileia|Paulinus]] fled with his clergy and flock to the island of [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] in Byzantine-controlled territory.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref>Madden 2004, p. 44</ref>\n\nFrom Aquileia, Alboin took the [[Via Postumia]] and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid succession [[Treviso|Tarvisium]] (Treviso), [[Vicenza|Vicentia]] (Vicenza), [[Verona]], [[Brescia|Brixia]] ([[Brescia]]) and [[Bergamo|Bergomum]] (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking [[Oderzo|Opitergium]] (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the [[Via Annia]], such as [[Altinum]], [[Padua|Patavium]] (Padova), [[Monselice|Mons Silicis]] (Monselice), [[Mantua]] and [[Cremona]].<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"HW288\"/> The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as [[Torcello]] and [[Eraclea|Heraclia]].<ref>Lane 1991, p. 7</ref><ref name=\"CAH19\">Humphries 2001, pp. 535\u2013536</ref><ref>Richards 1979, p. 34</ref>\n\nAlboin moved west in his march, invading the region of [[Liguria]] (north-west Italy) and reaching its capital [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the ''[[vicarius]] Italiae'' (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with the administration of the [[diocese of Annonarian Italy]]. Archbishop [[Honoratus of Mediolanum|Honoratus]], his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the ''vicarius Italiae'' to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of [[Genoa|Genua]] (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of ''dominus Italiae'' (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences in the northern part of the [[Po plain]], and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref>Christie 1998, p. 78</ref><ref name=\"SG256\">Gasparri 1990, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nSeveral explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It has been suggested that the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a vital part of the empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] in the [[Balkans]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's policies eastward.<ref name=\"SG256\"/><ref name=\"JJ31\"/><ref>Ostrogorsky 1993, p. 68</ref>\n\n=== Impact of the migration on Annonarian Italy ===\nThe impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive, especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562, when the last Gothic stronghold, Verona, was taken.<ref name=\"RC187\">Collins 1991, p. 187</ref> Many men of means (Paul's ''possessores'') either lost their lives or their goods, but the exact extent of the despoliation of the Roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate.<ref name=\"JJ31\">Jarnut 1995, p. 31</ref><ref>Wickham 2005, pp. 203, 210</ref><ref>Moorhead 2005, pp. 156\u2013157</ref> The clergy was also greatly affected. The Lombards were mostly pagans, and displayed little respect for the clergy and Church property. Many churchmen left their [[Episcopal see|sees]] to escape from the Lombards, like the two most senior bishops in the north, Honoratus and Paulinus. However, most of the [[suffragan bishop]]s in the north sought an accommodation with the Lombards, as did in 569 the bishop of Tarvisium [[Felix of Tarvisium|Felix]] when he journeyed to the [[Piave (river)|Piave river]] to parley with Alboin, obtaining respect for the Church and its goods in return for this act of homage. It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years. The transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern Italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the \"[[Schism of the Three Chapters|Three-Chapter Controversy]]\". In Lombard territory, churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution.<ref name=\"JJ31\"/><ref>Wolfram 1997, pp. 288\u2013289</ref><ref>Richards 1979, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nIn the view of Pierre Rich\u00e9, the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church.<ref name=\"HS84\">Schutz 2001, p. 84</ref> Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.<ref>Pohl 1997, pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\n=== Siege of Ticinum ===\n{{main|Siege of Pavia (569\u2013572)}}\n[[File:Alboin's entrance into Pavia.jpg|thumb|alt=A book illustration with an armed man on a horse in a town, and below the writing \"Alboin in Pavia\"|A modern rendering of Alboin's entrance into Ticinum]]\n\nThe first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of [[Ticinum]] ([[Pavia]]), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance, sitting at the confluence of the rivers [[Po (river)|Po]] and [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and connected by waterways to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]]. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the [[Alpes Maritimae]] and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]].<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"JJ30\"/><ref>Christie 1998, p. 79</ref><ref name=\"SG26\">Gasparri 1990, p. 26</ref><ref name=\"HW290\">Wolfram 1997, p. 290</ref>\n\nCareful to maintain the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as [[Aosta|Augusta Praetoria]] (Aosta), [[Susa (Italy)|Segusio]] (Susa), and the island of [[Comacina|Amacina]] in the [[Lake Como|Larius Lucus]] (Lake Como).<ref>Rovagnati 2003, p. 36</ref> During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] and plundered [[Tuscia]], but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], it was probably only in 578\u2013579 that [[Tuscany]] was conquered, but J\u00f6rg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, although it was not completed by the time of his death.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref name=\"HS82\"/><ref name=\"JJ30\"/><ref name=\"CAH19\"/><ref name=\"HW290\"/>\n\nAlboin's problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or ''duces'', who led each band (''fara'') of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as ''foederati'' but as enemies of the Empire.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"CAH19\"/><ref>Azzara 2009, pp. 95\u201396</ref><ref name=\"WP99\">Pohl 1997, p. 99</ref>\n\nThe king's disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of Frankish [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following [[Mummolus]]' victory at [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by [[Guntram]] in about 571.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"HW290\"/><ref name=\"WP99\"/><ref>Jarnut 1995, p. 35</ref> Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of [[Austrasia]], [[Sigebert I]]. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as [[Christopher Wickham|Chris Wickham]].<ref>Wickham 1989, pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nThe weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as very little is known of [[Faroald I of Spoleto|Faroald]] and [[Zotto]]'s respective rise to power in [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoletium]] ([[Spoleto]]) and [[Duchy of Benevento|Beneventum]] ([[Benevento]]).<ref name=\"WP99\"/><ref>Palmieri 1996, pp. 52\u201353</ref><ref>Moorhead 2005, p. 153</ref><ref>Christie 1998, pp. 80\u201382</ref>\n\n== Assassination ==\n\n=== Earliest narratives ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When his wife Chlotsinda died, Albin married another wife whose father he had killed a short time before. For this reason the woman always hated her husband and awaited an opportunity to avenge the wrong done her father, and so it happened that she fell in love with one of the household slaves and poisoned her husband. When he died she went off with the slave but they were overtaken and put to death together.\"<ref>Gregory 1916, p. 95</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''''Gregory of Tours'''''<br> Historia Francorum, Book II, Ch. 41\n|}\n\nTicinum eventually fell to the Lombards in either May or June 572. Alboin had in the meantime chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric. This choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the Gothic king.<ref name=\"DBI\"/>\n\nIt was in this palace that Alboin was killed on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most detailed narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by [[Marius Aventicensis|Marius of Aventicum]] in his ''Chronica'', written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him, called [[Helmichis|Hilmegis]] (Paul's Helmechis),<ref>Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Hilmegis'', p. 599</ref> with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. [[Roger Collins]] describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref>Collins 1991, pp. 187\u2013188</ref><ref>Jarnut 1995, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nAlso contemporary is [[Gregory of Tours]]' account presented in the ''Historia Francorum'', and echoed by the later [[Chronicle of Fredegar|Fredegar]]. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the ''Historia'' and calls its account of Alboin's demise \"a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity\".<ref name=\"WG392\">Goffart 1988, p. 392</ref>\n\n=== Skull cup ===\nElements present in Marius' account are echoed in Paul's ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', which also contains distinctive features. One of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the [[skull cup]]. In Paul, the events that led to Alboin's downfall unfold in Verona. During a great feast, Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund to drink from his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin \"invited her to drink merrily with her father\". This reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.<ref name=\"HS84\"/><ref name=\"SG1921\">Gasparri 1990, pp. 19\u201321</ref><ref name=\"HW291\">Wolfram 1997, p. 291</ref><ref name=\"WG391392\">Goffart 1988, pp. 391\u2013392</ref>\n[[File:School of Rubens - Alboin and Rosamunde.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a banquet with many participants in which a bearded man points to a woman with a cup while a seated woman looks the scene|The fatal banquet as painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in 1615]]\n\nThe tale has been often dismissed as a fable and Paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king [[Ratchis]]. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed to be part of a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.<ref name=\"HS84\"/><ref name=\"SG1921\"/><ref name=\"WG391392\"/>\n\nThe episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites [[original sin]] and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.<ref name=\"HS84\"/><ref name=\"WG391392\"/>\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Assassination of Alboin.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting with two men and a woman, in which one man pointing a spear against the other one who is holding a stooge, with the women is holding a sword|Alboin is killed by Peredeo while Rosamund steals his sword, in a 19th-century painting by [[Charles Landseer]]]]\n\nIn her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and ''[[spatharios|spatharius]]'' (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then recruited the king's ''[[cubicularius]]'' (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on [[June 28]], care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him.<ref name=\"PLRE3\"/><ref name=\"HW291\"/><ref name=\"JJ32\">Jarnut 1995, p. 32</ref> Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.<ref name=\"WG392\"/>\n\nPeredeo's figure and role is mostly introduced by Paul; the ''Origo'' had for the first time mentioned his name as \"Peritheus\", but there his role had been different, as he was not the assassin, but the instigator of the assassination. In the vein of his reading of the skull cup, Goffart sees Peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character: he notes a similarity between Peredeo's name and the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''peritus'', meaning \"lost\", a representation of those Lombards who entered into the service of the Empire.<ref name=\"WG393\">Goffart 1988, p. 393</ref>\n\nAlboin's death had a lasting impact, as it deprived the Lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and [[History of Bavaria|Bavarian]]s celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"SG20\"/><ref>Wolfram 1997, p. 285</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Helmegis then, upon the death of his king, attempted to usurp his kingdom, but he could not at all do this, because the Langobards, grieving greatly for the king's death, strove to make way with him.

Longinus, delighted by such a message, speedily sent a ship in which Helmegis with Rosemund his wife embarked, fleeing at night.\"<ref>Paul 1907, p. 84</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''''Paul the Deacon'''''<br> Historia Langobardorum, Book II, Ch. 29\n|}\n\nTo complete the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and legitimize his claim to the throne, Helmichis married the queen, whose high standing arose not only from being the king's widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining Gepid nation, and as such her support was a guarantee of the Gepids' loyalty to Helmichis. The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona, where many may have opposed Alboin's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire. The Byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot. It was in their interest to stem the Lombard tide by bringing a pro-Byzantine regime into power in Verona, and possibly in the long run break the unity of the Lombards' kingdom, winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments.<ref name=\"DBI\"/><ref name=\"SG26\"/><ref name=\"JJ32\"/><ref name=\"NC82\">Christie 1998, p. 82</ref><ref name=\"HW292\">Wolfram 1997, p. 292</ref><ref>Azzara 2009, p. 96</ref>\n\nThe coup ultimately failed, as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke [[Cleph]] the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter [[Albsuinda]]. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"NC82\"/><ref name=\"HW292\"/>\n\n[[File:Kingdom of the Lombards 572.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A map of Italy divided in orange and green colors, with a green blot for \"Longobard\" an orange one for \"Byzantine\"|Lombard and Byzantine territories at Alboin's death (572)]]\n\nCleph kept the throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slave]]. Possibly he too was killed at the instigation of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a [[Rule of the Dukes|decade of interregnum]], thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of [[Authari]], son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an [[exarchate of Ravenna|exarch]] in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.<ref>Schutz 2001, p. 85</ref><ref>Gasparri 1990, pp. 26\u201328</ref><ref>Wickham 1989, pp. 31\u201332</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky 1993, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe consolidation of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had long-lasting consequences for Italy, as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until [[Italian unification]] in 1861.<ref>Wickham 2005, p. 35</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\n:''See also [[Rosamund_(wife_of_Alboin)#Rosamund_in_later_culture|Rosamund (wife of Alboin) \u00a7 in later culture]]\nAlboin, together with other tribal leaders in mentioned in the 10th century [[Old English]] poem called ''[[Widsith]]'' (lines 70-75) :\n{{Verse translation |lang=ang |italicsoff=y |\nSwylce ic w\u00e6s on Eatule \n     mid \u00e6lfwine,\nse h\u00e6fde moncynnes,\n     mine gefr\u00e6ge,\nleohteste hond\n     lofes to wyrcenne,\nheortan unhneaweste     \n     hringa gedales,\nbeorhtra beaga,\n     bearn Eadwines.\n|\nI was in Italy \n     with Alboin too:\nof all men he had, \n     as I have heard,\nthe readiest hand \n     to do brave deeds,\nthe most generous heart \n     in giving out rings\nand shining torcs, \n     Audoin's son. \n}}\n\nThe historical period also formed the basis of the 1961 italian  adventure film ''[[Sword of the Conqueror]]'' (Italian: ''Rosmunda e Alboino'', German title ''Alboin, K\u00f6nig der Langobarden''), with [[Jack Palance]] as Alboin.\n\nThere have been several artistic depictions of events from Alboin's life including [[Peter Paul Reubens]]' ''Alboin and Rosamunde'' (1615); [[Charles Landseer]]'s ''Assassination of Alboin, King of the Lombards'' (1856); and [[Fortunino Matania]]'s illustration ''Rosamund captive before King Alboin of the Lombards'' (1942).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of kings of the Lombards]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|17em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].

Afonso began building the [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of Victory]] (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception),<ref>{{cite book|first=Laraine Newhouse|last=Carter|title=Persian Gulf States: Chapter 1B.

With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.\n\n====Arrest at Cannanore, 1509====\nAfonso arrived at [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he opened before the viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida, the sealed letter which he had received from the King, and which named as governor to succeed Almeida.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/><ref>Afonso, like many others since then, took office as governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the King promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented.</ref><ref>In the first months of 1508, the son of D. Francisco de Almeida, [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], died in dramatic circumstances at the [[Battle of Chaul]] and there are reports that the viceroy, an enlightened and incorruptible ruler, turned vindictive and cruel.</ref>\nThe viceroy, supported by the officers who had abandoned Afonso at Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but declined to yield, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] fleet of [[Mirocem]], refusing Afonso's offer to fight him himself. Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of the Viceroy, who encouraged him to seize power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda|title=Historia do Descobrimento e Conquista da India pelos Portugueses|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1833|publisher=Typographia Rollandiana}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and the [[Mahmud Begada|Sultan of Gujarat]], regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Kannur|Cannanore]].<ref>{{harv|Henry Morse Stephens|1897|pp=61\u201362}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=R.

He was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos, but left for Cochin and then for Portugal, leaving his fleet to Afonso.\n\n===Conquest of Goa, 1510===\n{{Main|Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)}}\n[[File:\"Plan de Goa\", in Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages,1750.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicts the aftermath of the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]], from the forces of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]].]]\nIn January 1510, obeying the orders from the King and aware of the absence of [[Zamorin]], Afonso advanced on Calicut. The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat, barely escaping with his life. Coutinho was killed during the escape. <ref name=\"Foundations\"/>\n\nSoon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\">Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, \"Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498\u20131763\" pp. 34\u201336</ref> and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal \"guest\" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.\n\nA first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.\n\nThree months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape.<ref>Kerr, Robert (1824)</ref> Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief \"[[Aguazil]]\" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs.<ref name=\"Bhagamandala\"/> He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.\n[[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]]\nIn Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history|year=1990|isbn=978-81-7022-226-2|pages=220\u2013221}}</ref> The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or \"esfera\"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

So it was to do Our Lord\u2019s service that we were brought here; by taking Malacca, we would close the Straits so that never again would the Moslems be able to bring their spices by this route.... I am very sure that, if this Malacca trade is taken out of their hands, Cairo and Mecca will be completely lost.''\" (The Commentaries of the Great Afonso de Albuquerque)\n[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]]]]\nIn February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Ara\u00fajo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\">{{cite book|last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300 (2nd Ed.)|year=1991|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-57689-6|page=23}}</ref> He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.\n\nAfter a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.\n\nAfonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled.<ref name=\"Foundations\"/> Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.<ref name=\"Bosworth2007\">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|title=Historic cities of the Islamic world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA317|accessdate=23 August 2011|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=317}}</ref>\nAfonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack,<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp23\"/> building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as \"[[A Famosa]]\" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for \"The stone the builders rejected\", from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front.<ref>{{cite book|author=Afonso de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] and [[Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tom\u00e9 was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal).<ref>Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett.

During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.\n\nWhile at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, \"all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught\".<ref>Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.\n\n===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513===\nIn December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought \"[[Prester John]]\" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Millet Rogers|title=The Quest for Eastern Christians|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lBh--X3QjnsC&pg=PA1|year=1962|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-0275-9|page=1}}</ref> The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.\n\nIn February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris.

In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], he wrote to King Manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile]] river to render the whole country barren.

As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque. Thus, peace talks could commence. the Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the customs of Calicut as yearly tribute.<ref>Elaine Sanceau (1936).

At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or \"married men\") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except \"[[Sati (practice)|sati]]\", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).\n\nIn March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.\n\nIn early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[Indian rhinoceros]].<ref>Bedini, p. 112</ref> Afonso sent the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel.<ref name=\"lambe\">[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html Hist\u00f3ria do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht D\u00fcrer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155010/http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html |date=18 February 2009 }}, Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{pt icon}}.</ref> In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous [[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros]] to Pope Leo X.

The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.\n\nAt the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus \"freeing\" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622.<ref name=\"intlhistory.blogspot.com.au\">\" target=\"_blank\"http://intlhistory.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/alfonso-de-albuquerque-history-figure.html</ref> At Ormuz, Afonso met with Miguel Ferreira, returning with rich presents and an ambassador, carrying a letter from the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Holland Rose |author2=Ernest Alfred Benians |author3=Arthur Percival Newton |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1928|publisher=CUP Archive|page=12}}</ref> There he remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts, receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress, while becoming increasingly ill.

At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\">Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s de (1774).

Hearing rumours that the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultan of Egypt]] was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.<ref name=\"Albuquerque\"/><ref name=\"Early\"/>\n\nAfter 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a church in Lisbon,<ref>''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, p. 23</ref> which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Great Lisbon earthquake]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|right|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902)]]\nKing Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, [[Br\u00e1s de Albuquerque]] (1500\u20131580),<ref>Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Universalgeschichte'' \"W.

In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''<ref>Forbes, Jack D.

There Afonso was described as \"a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune.\"<ref>Albuquerque, Br\u00e1s, ''Commentaries'', vol VI, p. 198</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Afonso's feats were described in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es|Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es]] (Canto X, strophes 40\u201349). The poet praises his achievements, but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Cam\u00f5es was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.\n\nA [[Alphonso (mango)|variety of mango]] that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alphonso mangoes|work=Savani Farms|url=http://www.savanifarms.com/|accessdate=14 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nNumerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] monument; there is a [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square|square carrying his name]] in the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]], which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop [[Afonso de Albuquerque (1884)|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'' (1884)]] and the warship [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque|NRP ''Afonso de Albuquerque'']], the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.\n\n===Global legacy===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue)]]\nThe fabled [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times. In the 2nd century AD, the [[Malay Peninsula]] was known by the Greek philosopher [[Ptolemy]], who labeled it 'Aurea Chersonesus\"; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance.

The city had long been ruled by kings born to the Penthilid clan but, during the poet's life, the Penthilids were a spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power. Alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success. Their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession:\n* Melanchrus \u2013 he was overthrown sometime between 612&nbsp;BC and 609&nbsp;BC by a faction that, in addition to the brothers of Alcaeus, included [[Pittacus]] (later renowned as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]); Alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved;\n* Myrsilus \u2013 it is not known when he came to power but some verses by Alcaeus (frag. 129) indicate that the poet, his brothers and Pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that Pittacus subsequently betrayed them; Alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote a drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrant's death (frag. 332);\n* Pittacus \u2013 the dominant political figure of his time, he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of Mytilene and appears to have governed well (590-580&nbsp;BC), even allowing Alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace.\n\nSometime before 600&nbsp;BC, Mytilene fought Athens for control of [[Sigeion]] and Alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting. According to the historian [[Herodotus]],<ref>''Histories'' 5.95</ref> the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious Athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend, Melanippus. It is thought that Alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile, including at least one visit to Egypt. His older brother, Antimenidas, appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and probably took part in the conquest of Askelon. Alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of Antimenides' return, including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent (frag. 350), and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home (frag. 357).\n{{Quotation|\"Alcaeus was in some respects not unlike a [[Royalist]] soldier of the age of the [[Stuarts]]. He had the high spirit and reckless gaiety, the love of country bound up with belief in a caste, the licence tempered by generosity and sometimes by tenderness, of a cavalier who has seen good and evil days.\" \u2014 [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DbLHNxS6heMC&pg=PA3 R.

[[The Walters Art Museum]].]]\nAlcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of [[Sappho]] and, since both poets composed for the entertainment of Mytilenean friends, they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis, such as at the ''Kallisteia'', an annual festival celebrating the island's federation under Mytilene, held at the 'Messon' (referred to as ''temenos'' in frs. 129 and 130), where Sappho performed publicly with female choirs. Alcaeus' reference to Sappho in terms more typical of a divinity, as ''holy/pure, honey-smiling Sappho'' (fr. 384), may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival.<ref name=\"university19\"/> The Lesbian or Aeolic school of poetry \"reached in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after-wards approached\"<ref>James S. Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'', W. H. Lowdermilk and Co., Washington, 1901</ref> and it was assumed by later Greek critics and during the early centuries of the Christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers, a theme which became a favourite subject in art (as in the urn pictured above).\n\n==Poetry==\nThe poetic works of Alcaeus were collected into ten books, with elaborate commentaries, by the Alexandrian scholars [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] sometime in the 3rd century BC, and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form, varying in size from mere phrases, such as ''wine, window into a man'' (fr. 333) to entire groups of verses and stanzas, such as those quoted below (fr. 346). Alexandrian scholars numbered him in their [[Nine lyric poets|canonic nine]] (one lyric poet per Muse). Among these, [[Pindar]] was held by many ancient critics to be pre-eminent,<ref>[[Quintilian]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]; cf. [[Longinus (literature)|Pseudo-Longinus]] [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/longinus/desub011.htm#xxxiii 33.5].</ref> but some gave precedence to Alcaeus instead.<ref name=\"digitized1\">James Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'' p.31</ref> The canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups, with Alcaeus, Sappho and [[Anacreon]], being 'monodists' or 'solo-singers', with the following characteristics:<ref>Andrew M.Miller (trans.), ''Greek Lyric: An Anthology in Translation'', Hackett Publishing Co. (1996), Intro. xiii</ref>\n* They composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them;\n* They wrote in their native dialects (Alcaeus and Sappho in Aeolic dialect, Anacreon in Ionic);\n* They preferred quite short, metrically simple stanzas or 'strophes' which they re-used in many poems \u2014 hence the 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them.\nThe other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions, performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses. However, this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited, or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance. Even the private reflections of Alcaeus, ostensibly sung at dinner parties, still retain a public function.<ref name=\"university19\">{{cite book|first=Gregory |last=Nagy|title=Lyric and Greek Myth (The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology)|publisher= ed.

Alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own 'down-to-earth' style and Sappho's more 'celestial' qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess (as cited above), and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane, each emphasising different elements in that balance.<ref name=\"university19\"/>\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] exhorts us to \"Observe in Alcaeus the sublimity, brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power, his splendid figures, and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect; and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs,\"<ref>''Imit. 422'', quoted from Easby-Smith in ''Songs of Alcaeus''</ref> while [[Quintilian]], after commending Alcaeus for his excellence \"in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals; in his language he is concise, exalted, careful and often like an orator;\" goes on to add: \"but he descended into wantonness and amours, though better fitted for higher things.\"<ref>Quintillian 10.1.63, quoted by D.Campbell in ''G.L.P'', p. 288</ref>\n\n===Poetic genres===\nThe works of Alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres.\n* '''Political songs''': Alcaeus often composed on a political theme, covering the power struggles on Lesbos with the passion and vigour of a partisan, cursing his opponents,<ref>fr. 129</ref> rejoicing in their deaths,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">fr. 332</ref> delivering blood-curdling homilies on the consequences of political inaction<ref>fr. S262</ref> and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance, as in one of his 'ship of state' allegories.<ref>fr. 6</ref> Commenting on Alcaeus as a political poet, the scholar [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] once observed that \"...if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoric.\"<ref>''Imit. 422'', quoted by Campbell in ''G.L.P.'', p. 286</ref>\n* '''Drinking songs''': According to the grammarian [[Athenaeus]], Alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of it.<ref>Athenaeus 10.430c</ref> Alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of a tyrant's death,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">fr. 332</ref> to drink away their sorrows,<ref>Frs. 335, 346</ref> to drink because life is short<ref>fr. 38A</ref> and along the lines ''in vino veritas'',<ref>fr. 333</ref> to drink through winter storms<ref>fr. 338</ref> and to drink through the heat of summer.<ref>fr. 347</ref> The latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from [[Hesiod]],<ref>Hesiod ''Op.'' 582\u20138</ref> re-casting them in Asclepiad meter and Aeolian dialect.\n* '''Hymns''': Alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the [[Homeric hymns]], to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his 'secular' lyrics.<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), p. 286</ref> There are for example fragments in 'Sapphic' meter praising the [[Dioscuri]],<ref>fr. 34a</ref> [[Hermes]]<ref>fr. 308b</ref> and the river [[Maritsa|Hebrus]]<ref>fr. 45</ref> (a river significant in Lesbian mythology since it was down its waters that the head of [[Orpheus]] was believed to have floated singing, eventually crossing the sea to Lesbos and ending up in a temple of Apollo, as a symbol of Lesbian supremacy in song).<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), pp. 292\u20133</ref> According to [[Porphyrion]], the hymn to Hermes was imitated by Horace in one of his own 'sapphic' odes (C.1.10: ''Mercuri, facunde nepos Atlantis'').<ref>David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 213</ref>\n* '''Love songs''': Almost all Alcaeus' amorous verses, mentioned with disapproval by Quintilian above, have vanished without trace. There is a brief reference to his love poetry in a passage by [[Cicero]].<ref>Cicero, ''Tusc. Disp.'' 4.71</ref> [[Horace]], who often wrote in imitation of Alcaeus, sketches in verse one of the Lesbian poet's favourite subjects \u2014 Lycus of the black hair and eyes (C.1.32.11-12: ''nigris oculis nigroque/crine decorum''). It is possible that Alcaeus wrote amorously about Sappho, as indicated in an earlier quote.<ref>fr. 384</ref>\n* '''Miscellaneous''': Alcaeus wrote on such a wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge. The grammarian Athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike Alcaeus could be<ref>fr. 362, Athenaeus 15.687d</ref> and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his house<ref>fr. 357</ref> as proof that he could be unusually warlike for a lyric poet.<ref>Athenaeus 14.627a</ref> Other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brother's heroic exploits as a Babylonian mercenary<ref>fr. 350</ref> and  lyrics sung in a rare meter (Sapphic Ionic in minore) in the voice of a distressed girl,<ref>fr. 10B</ref> \"Wretched me, who share in all ills!\" \u2014 possibly imitated by Horace in an ode in the same meter (C.3.12: ''Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci'').<ref name=\"literature214\">David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and E.

(1996), p. 48</ref>}}\n\nThe Greek meter here is relatively simple, comprising the Greater [[Asclepiad (poetry)|Asclepiad]], adroitly used to convey, for example, the rhythm of jostling cups  ({{lang|grc|\u1f00 \u03b4' \u1f00\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f00\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd}}). The language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences \u2014 the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning, comprising an exhortation (\"Let's drink!), a rhetorical question (\"Why are we waiting for the lamps?\") and a justifying statement (Only an inch of daylight left.)<ref>David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 212</ref> The meaning is clear and uncomplicated, the subject is drawn from personal experience, and there is an absence of poetic ornament, such as simile or metaphor. Like many of his poems (e.g., frs. 38, 326, 338, 347, 350), it begins with a verb (in this case \"Let's drink!\") and it includes a proverbial expression (\"Only an inch of daylight left\") though it is possible that he coined it himself.<ref name=\"David A 1982 page 287\"/>\n\n===A hymn (fr. 34)===\nAlcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm-tossed ship of state. The following fragment of a hymn to Castor and Polydeuces (the [[Dioscuri]]) is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyage.<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), pp. 286, 289</ref>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nHither now to me from your isle of Pelops,\nYou powerful children of Zeus and Leda,\nShowing youselves kindly by nature, Castor\nAnd Polydeuces!\n\nTravelling abroad on swift-footed horses,\nOver the wide earth, over all the ocean,\nHow easily you bring deliverance from\nDeath's gelid rigor,\n\nLanding on tall ships with a sudden, great bound,\nA far-away light up the forestays running,\nBringing radiance to a ship in trouble,\nSailed in the darkness!\n</poem>\n\nThe poem was written in [[Sapphic stanza]]s, a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot, Sappho, but in which he too excelled, here paraphrased in English to suggest the same rhythms. There were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remain.<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric'' Vol. I, Loeb Classical Library (1990), p. 247</ref> The 'far-away light' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9}}) is a reference to [[St Elmo's Fire]], an electrical discharge supposed by ancient Greek mariners to be an epiphany of the Dioscuri, but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar\u2014such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry (see [[Alcaeus of Mytilene#Scholars, fragments and sources|Scholars, fragments and sources]] below). This poem doesn't begin with a verb but with an adverb (\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad) but still communicates a sense of action. He probably performed his verses at [[Symposium|drinking parties]] for friends and political allies\u2014men for whom loyalty was essential, particularly in such troubled times.<ref name=\"literature214\"/>\n\n==Tributes from other poets==\n\n===Horace===\nThe Roman poet [[Horace]] modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of Alcaeus, rendering the Lesbian poet's verse-forms, including 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, into concise Latin \u2014 an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes.<ref>Horace ''Od.'' 3.30</ref> In his second book, in an ode composed in Alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm, he imagines meeting Alcaeus and Sappho in [[Hades]]:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|la|quam paene furvae regna [[Proserpina]]e\net iudicantem vidimus [[Aeacus|Aeacum]]\n:sedesque descriptas piorum et\n::Aeoliis fidibus querentem\n\nSappho puellis de popularibus\net te sonantem plenius aureo,\n:Alcaee, plectro dura navis,\n::dura fugae mala, dura belli!}} <ref>Horace ''Od.'' 2.13.21\u20138</ref>\n|\nHow close the realm of dusky Proserpine\nYawned at that instant!

A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classic Press, 1982, pp. 285\u2013305</ref> His verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition \u2014 generations of scribes copying an author's collected works, such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of [[Pindar]]'s odes \u2014 but haphazardly, in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive, and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and other locations in Egypt: sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively, adding little by little to the world's store of poetic fragments.\n\nAncient scholars quoted Alcaeus in support of various arguments. Thus for example Heraclitus 'The Allegorist'<ref>Donald. A. Russell and David Konstan (ed.s and tran.s.), ''Heraclitus:Homeric Problems'', Society of Biblical Literature (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pLf2PNEy53AC&pg=PP14 Introduction]</ref> quoted fr. 326 and part of fr. 6, about ships in a storm, in his study on Homer's use of allegory.<ref>Heraclitus ''All''.5</ref> The hymn to Hermes, fr308(b), was quoted by [[Hephaestion (grammarian)]]<ref>Hephaestion ''Ench.'' xiv.1</ref> and both he and [[Libanius]], the rhetorician, quoted the first two lines of fr. 350,<ref>Hephaestion ''Ench.'' x 3; Libanus ''Or.'' 13.5</ref> celebrating the return from Babylon of Alcaeus' brother. The rest of fr. 350 was paraphrased in prose by the historian/geographer [[Strabo]].<ref>Strabo 13.617</ref> Many fragments were supplied in quotes by [[Athenaeus]], principally on the subject of wine-drinking, but fr. 333, \"wine, window into a man\", was quoted much later by the Byzantine grammarian, [[John Tzetzes]].<ref>Tzetzes ''Alex.'' 212</ref>\n\nThe first 'modern' publication of Alcaeus' verses appeared in a Greek and Latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by Michael Neander, published at Basle in 1556. This was followed by another edition of the nine poets, collected by [[Henricus Stephanus]] and published in Paris in 1560. Fulvius Ursinus compiled a fuller collection of Alcaic fragments, including a commentary, which was published at Antwerp in 1568. The first separate edition of Alcaeus was by Christian David Jani and it was published at Halle in 1780. The next separate edition was by August Matthiae, Leipzig 1827.\n\nSome of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century. Thus for example two separate quotes by Athenaeus<ref>Athenaeus 15.674cd, 15.687d</ref> were united by [[Theodor Bergk]] to form fr. 362. Three separate sources were combined to form fr. 350, as mentioned above, including a prose paraphrase from Strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter, a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of Otto Hoffmann, [[Karl Otfried Muller]]<ref>M\u00fcller, Karl Otfried, \"Ein Bruder des Dichters Alk\u00e4os ficht unter Nebukadnezar,\" ''Rheinisches Museum'' 1 (1827):287.</ref> and [[Franz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens]]. The discovery of the Oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research. In fact, eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri \u2014 frs. 9, 38A, 42, 45, 34, 129, 130 and most recently S262. These fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with 'educated guesses', including for example a \"brilliant supplement\" by [[Maurice Bowra]] in fr. 34, a hymn to the Dioscuri that includes a description of [[St Elmo's fire]] in the ship's rigging.<ref>David.

[[Hera]], after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos]] and made the wife of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfilment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.<ref name=\"Hom. Il. 19.95\">[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+19.95 19.95ff.]</ref>\n\n====Ovid====\nAccording to [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', while in labour, Alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After seven days and nights of agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|goddess of childbirth]] (the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of [[Eileithyia]]). While Lucina did go to Alcmene, she had been previously instructed by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Hera) to prevent the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene writhed in pain, cursed the heavens, and came close to death. [[Galanthis]], a maid of Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's behaviour and quickly deduced that it was Juno's doing. To put an end to her mistress's suffering, she announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, which surprised Lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell, and gave birth to Heracles.

Protection outside the Republic was more problematic, however. The firm maintained an agency in Paris, but its commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions, produced in Lyons and elsewhere.<ref name=\"A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice\" />\n\n==Beginnings==\n[[File:Title page of Herodotus' history of the Greek and Persian Wars 1502.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italian language|Italian]] translation of [[Herodotus' Histories]] by Count [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], published in [[Venice]], Aldine Press in 1502 (1533?).]]\n[[Aldus Manutius]], the founder of the Aldine Press, was originally a humanist scholar and teacher. Manutius met Andrea Torresani, who had acquired publishing equipment from [[Nicolas Jenson|Nicholas Jensen]]'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, [[Agostino Barbarigo]], and the other half by Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing, leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani. In 1496, Aldus established his own location in a building called the ''Thermae'' in the [[San Polo|Sestiere di San Polo]]. The building was later demolished in 1873. Manutius lived and worked in the ''Thermae'' to produce published books from the Aldine Press. This was also the location of the \"New Academy\", where a group of Manutius' friends, associates, and editors came together to translate Greek and Latin texts.<ref name=\"New Aldine Studies\">{{cite book|last1=Fletcher III|first1=Harry George|title=New Aldine Studies|date=1988|publisher=Bernard M. Rosenthal, Inc.|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-9600094-1-8}}</ref>{{rp|1-5}}\n\n==Accomplishments of the Aldine Press==\nThe press was started by Manutius based on his love of classics and the need of preservation of Hellenic studies. At first the press printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. Manutius  also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books, used by scholars wanting to learn Greek to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly.<ref name=\"The Printing Press as an Agent of Change\">{{cite book|last1=Eisenstein|first1=Elizabeth L.|title=The Printing Press as an Agent of Change|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}</ref> Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek with whom the Aldine Press partnered in order to provide accurately translated text.<ref name=\"The Printing Press as an Agent of Change\" />{{rp|221}} The Aldine Press also expanded into current languages, mainly Italian and French.<ref name=\"New Aldine Studies\" />[[File:Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012]]\n===Humanist typefaces===\nAldus Manutius hired [[Francesco Griffo]] to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the humanists. This resulted in the first roman face adapted and known today as [[italic type]]. It was first used to print [[Pietro Bembo|Cardinal Pietro Bembo's]] ''De Aetna'' in 1495. Before this time print publishing used block letters, the look of handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and, try as he might to prevent it, Manutius' typeface was illegally copied, spreading through Europe.<ref name=\"The Evolution of Type\" />\n\n===Aldus Manutius the Elder's portable books===\nIn 1505 Manutius produced plain texts in useful form, using the term ''[[enchiridion]]'', meaning a manual or small, hand-held weapon.<ref name=\"New Aldine Studies\" /> The [[octavo]] was the first appearance of the editio minor, a straightforward text, established as well as the editor can manage. Although these new, portable books were not cheap, the books of the Aldine Press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and commentary demanded during this era. The editio minor, instead, brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics. An individual didn't have to go to the book, rather now the book came along with them.<ref name=\"New Aldine Studies\" />{{rp|1-7}}\n\n===Imprint and motto===\nIn 1501, Aldus used as his publisher's device the image of a [[dolphin]] wrapped around an [[anchor]].<ref>H. George Fletcher, ''In praise of Aldus Manutius'' (New York: Morgan Library, 1995), pp. 26\u201327.</ref> \"The dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most immediately to Pietro Bembo.

After his death the firm was run by Andrea Torresani and his daughter, Maria, the widow of Aldus Manutius. The Aldine Press was named in 1508 as \"In the House of Aldus and Andrea Torresano\" which kept this name until 1529. In 1533, [[Paulus Manutius]] managed the firm, starting it up again and changing its name to \"Heirs of Aldus and Andrea Torresano\". In 1539 the imprint changed to \"Sons of Aldo Manuzio\".

He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at [[Winchester]], he was appointed [[Abbot]] of [[Tavistock Abbey]] in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served [[Edward the Confessor]], the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, [[Edward the Exile]], back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.\n\nIn 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so.<ref name=Edward208>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 208\u2013209</ref> As administrator of the [[Diocese of Hereford]], he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], a Welsh ruler.\n\nIn 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]] as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood.\n\nSome sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned [[Harold Godwinson]] as King of England.<ref name=Hindley335>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 335</ref> Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Ealdred backed [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] and then endorsed King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], the [[Duke of Normandy]] and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.\n\n==Early life==\nEaldred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to [[Lyfing of Winchester|Lyfing]], his predecessor as bishop of Worcester.<ref name=DNB>Lawson \"Ealdred\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do.<ref name=King124>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 124</ref> Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became [[Abbot of Gloucester]].<ref name=DNB/> Ealdred was a monk in the [[cathedral chapter]] at [[Winchester Cathedral]] before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043.<ref name=Knowles72>Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 72</ref> Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death.<ref name=King124/> No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.<ref name=King125>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 125</ref>\n\nEaldred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in 1062.<ref name=Handbook224>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 224</ref> He may have acted as [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]], or subordinate bishop, to his predecessor Lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric,<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Edward86>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 86</ref> as from about 1043 Ealdred witnessed as an ''episcopus'', or bishop, and a charter from 1045 or early 1046 names Sihtric as abbot of Tavistock.<ref name=King125/> Lyfing died on 26 March 1046, and Ealdred became bishop of Worcester shortly after. However, Ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that Lyfing had held, [[Bishop of Crediton|Crediton]] and [[Bishop of Cornwall|Cornwall]]; King Edward the Confessor (reigned 1043\u20131066) granted these to [[Leofric (bishop)|Leofric]], who combined the two sees at Crediton in 1050.<ref name=King125/>\n\n==Bishop and royal advisor==\n[[Image:Harold2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Harold Godwinson, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], whom Ealdred failed to catch in 1051|alt=Tapestry image of a man on horseback holding a falcon]]\n\nEaldred was an advisor to King Edward the Confessor, and was often involved in the royal government.<ref name=Huscroft49/> He was also a military leader, and in 1046 he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh.<ref name=Huscroft49>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 49</ref> This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers [[Gruffydd ap Rhydderch]], [[Rhys ap Rhydderch]], and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh soldiers who were serving with the English, and Ealdred was defeated.<ref name=Maund89>Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 89\u201390</ref>\n\nIn 1050, Ealdred went to Rome \"on the king's errand\",<ref name=Huscroft50>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 50</ref> apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat, or centre, of the bishopric of Crediton to Exeter. It may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage, if sources from after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] are to be believed.<ref name=DNB/> While in Rome, he attended a papal council, along with his fellow English bishop [[Herman (bishop)|Herman]].<ref name=Smith574>Smith, et al. \"Court and Piety\" ''Catholic Historical Review'' p. 574</ref> That same year, as Ealdred was returning to England he met [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]], a son of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], and probably absolved Sweyn for having abducted the abbess of [[Leominster Abbey]] in 1046.<ref name=Godwins55>Barlow ''Godwins'' p. 55</ref> Through Ealdred's intercession, Sweyn was restored to his earldom, which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin [[Beorn Estrithson]].<ref name=Rex37>Rex ''Harold II'' p. 37</ref><ref name=Edward103>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 103</ref> Ealdred helped Sweyn not only because Ealdred was a supporter of Earl Godwin's family but because Sweyn's earldom was close to his bishopric. As recently as 1049 Irish raiders had allied with Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] in raiding along the [[River Usk]]. Ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders, but was again routed by the Welsh. This failure underscored Ealdred's need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids.<ref name=Mason57>Mason ''House of Godwine'' pp. 57\u201358</ref> Normally, the [[bishop of Hereford]] would have led the defence in the absence of an Earl of Hereford, but in 1049 the incumbent, [[\u00c6thelstan (Bishop of Hereford)|\u00c6thelstan]], was blind, so Ealdred took on the role of defender.<ref name=King126>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 126\u2013127</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic travels==\nEarl Godwin's rebellion against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was a supporter of the earl and his family. Ealdred was present at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family.<ref name=King127>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 127</ref> Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept Harold Godwinson and his brothers as they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred \"could not, or would not\" capture the brothers.<ref name=Harold132>Walker ''Harold'' pp. 132\u2013133</ref><ref name=Edward114>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 114</ref> The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of [[\u00c6lfric Puttoc]], the Archbishop of York. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held in [[Benefice|plurality]], or at the same time. Ealdred probably wanted to become Archbishop of York after \u00c6lfric's death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing [[Cynesige]], a royal chaplain, instead.<ref name=King127/> In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power.<ref name=Huscroft6>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 6\u20137</ref> By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour.<ref name=King127/> At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.<ref name=Fleming79>Fleming ''Kings & Lords in Conquest England'' pp. 79\u201380</ref>{{efn|If he did accompany Swein, the historian [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] argues that it was probably in 1058.<ref name=BarlowChurch88>Barlow ''English Church 1000\u20131066'' p. 88</ref>}}\n\nIn 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany to obtain Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]'s help in returning [[Edward the Exile]], son of [[Edmund Ironside]], to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], having left England as an infant after his father's death and the accession of [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] as King of England.<ref name=Huscroft8>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 8</ref> In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year<ref name=Walker76>Walker ''Harold'' p. 76</ref> with [[Herman II (Archbishop of Cologne)|Hermann II]], the [[Archbishop of Cologne]].<ref name=Edward215>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 215\u2013218</ref> He also was impressed with the buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions.<ref name=King128>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 128</ref> The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help Ealdred.<ref name=Mason88>Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 88</ref> Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court.<ref name=Rex126>Rex ''Harold II'' p. 126</ref>{{efn|Edward eventually returned to England in 1057, but died shortly thereafter.<ref name=Rex127>Rex ''Harold II'' p. 127</ref>}} Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.<ref name=King128/>\n\nEaldred had returned to England by 1055, and brought with him a copy of the ''[[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]]'', a [[Roman Pontifical|set of liturgies]], with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript [[Cotton library|Cotton Vitellus E xii]], has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred.<ref name=King128/> It appears likely that the ''[[Chrodegang of Metz|Rule of Chrodegang]]'', a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]], was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.<ref name=Rex77>Rex ''Harold II'' p. 77</ref>\n\nAfter Ealdred's return to England he took charge of the sees of Hereford<ref name=Mason94>Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 94</ref> and [[Bishop of Ramsbury (ancient)|Ramsbury]].<ref name=Harold132/> Ealdred also administered [[Winchcombe Abbey]] and [[Gloucester Abbey]].<ref name=Edward198>Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 197\u2013199</ref> The authors of the ''Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition'' say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060,<ref name=Handbook217>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 217</ref> but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant,<ref name=Huscroft45>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 45</ref> or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops''</ref>\n\nEaldred became involved with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop [[Herman (bishop)|Herman]] got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to [[Malmesbury Abbey]]. Herman wished to move the seat of his see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close associate of Herman's,<ref name=King128/> and the historian [[H. R. Loyn]] called Herman \"something of an alter ego\" to Ealdred.<ref name=Loyn61>Loyn ''English Church'' p. 61</ref> According to the medieval chronicler [[John of Worcester]], Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration of Ramsbury.<ref name=King128/>\n\n==Welsh affairs, Jerusalem, and Worcester==\nThe king again employed Ealdred as a diplomat in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric in negotiations with the Welsh.<ref name=King128a/> Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop [[Leofgar of Hereford]], who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace.<ref name=Maund94>Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 94\u201395</ref> Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward,<ref name=King128a/> but the oath may not have had any obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court.<ref name=Maund94/> Ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York.<ref name=King128a>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 128\u2013129</ref> The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights.<ref name=King128a/> Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.<ref name=Darlington399/>\n\nIn 1058 Ealdred made a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], the first English bishop to make the journey.<ref name=Edward208/> He travelled through Hungary, and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' stated that \"he went to Jerusalem in such state as no-one had done before him\".<ref name=QKing130>Quoted in King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130</ref> While in Jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the [[church of the Holy Sepulchre]].<ref name=BarlowChurch89>Barlow ''English Church 1000\u20131066'' p. 89</ref> It is possible that the reason Ealdred travelled through Hungary was to arrange the travel of Edward the Exile's family to England. Another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to King Edward in Hungary.<ref name=King130>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130</ref> It is not known exactly when Edward the Exile's family returned to England, whether they returned with Edward in 1057, or sometime later, so it is only a possibility that they returned with Ealdred in 1058.<ref name=Rex129>Rex ''Harold II'' p. 129</ref>\n\nVery little documentary evidence is available from Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in ''[[Hemming's Cartulary]]'' as copies only. How the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|diocese of Worcester]] was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the prior of the [[cathedral chapter]], performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|Evesham Chronicle]]'' states that [[\u00c6thelwig]], who became abbot of [[Evesham Abbey]] in 1058, administered Worcester before he became abbot.<ref name=King134>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 134\u2013137</ref>\n\n==Archbishop of York==\n[[File:Bayeux Edward Funeral.jpg|left|upright=2.4|thumb|The funeral cortege of Edward the Confessor, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]|alt=Tapestry image of a procession of men carrying a coffin heading towards a church building.]]\nCynesige, the archbishop of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected [[Archbishop of York]] on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, and it appears that Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done.<ref name=King130/> There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself.<ref name=Loyn158>Loyn ''Governance'' p. 158</ref>\n\nIn 1061 Ealdred travelled to Rome to receive the [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Journeying with him was [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]], another son of Earl Godwin, who was now earl of [[Northumbria]].<ref name=Hindley330>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 330</ref> William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred, by \"amusing the simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors, had acquired, more by bribery than by reason, the archbishopric of York while still holding his former see.\"<ref name=Powell13>Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords'' pp. 13\u201314</ref> On his arrival in Rome, however, charges of [[simony]], or the buying of ecclesiastical office, and lack of learning were brought against him, and his elevation to York was refused by [[Pope Nicholas II]], who also deposed him from Worcester.<ref name=Powell13/> The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the ''Vita Edwardi'', a life of Edward the Confessor, but the ''Vita Wulfstani'', an account of the life of Ealdred's successor at Worcester, [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred.<ref name=King131>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 131</ref> Yet another chronicler, John of Worcester, mentions nothing of any trouble in Rome, and when discussing the appointment of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people.<ref name=King131/> John of Worcester also claims that at Wulfstan's consecration, [[Stigand]], the archbishop of Canterbury extracted a promise from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the Canterbury\u2013York supremacy struggle, the story of Ealdred renouncing any claims to Worcester needs to be considered suspect.<ref name=King131a>King \"Ealdred\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 131\u2013132</ref>\n\nFor whatever reason, Ealdred gave up the see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates arrived in England to hold a council and make sure that Ealdred relinquished Worcester.<ref name=Harold50>Walker ''Harold'' p. 50</ref> This happened at Easter in 1062.<ref name=Darlington399>Darlington \"Ecclesiastical Reform\" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 399\u2013400</ref> Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and \u00c6thelwig.<ref name=Monastic76>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 76</ref> The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness.<ref name=BarlowChurch106>Barlow ''English Church 1000\u20131066'' pp. 106\u2013107</ref> Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province.<ref name=Brooks306>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 306</ref> Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester.

Alexander governed tyrannically and was constantly seeking to control [[Thessaly]] and the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. He also engaged in piratical raids on [[Attica]].  Alexander was murdered by the brothers of his wife, Thebe, as it was said that she lived in fear of her husband and hated Alexander's cruel and brutal character.\n\n==Reign==\nThe accounts of how Alexander came to power vary somewhat in minor points.  [[Diodorus Siculus]] tells us that upon the assassination of the tyrant [[Jason of Pherae]], in 370 BC, his brother Polydorus ruled for a year, but he was then poisoned by Alexander, another brother.<ref name=\"ds\">[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 60-61</ref>  However, according to [[Xenophon]], Polydorus was murdered by his brother Polyphron, who was, in turn,<ref name=\"xh\">[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 34</ref><ref>This date is at variance with [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (vi. 5)</ref><ref name=\"wess\">Wesseling, ''On [[Diodorus Siculus]]'' xv. 75</ref> murdered by his nephew Alexander \u2014son of Jason, in 369 BC.  [[Plutarch]] relates that Alexander worshipped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god.<ref name=\"wess\"/><ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Pelop.'' p. 293, &c.</ref>  Alexander governed tyrannically, and according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],<ref name=\"ds\"/> differently from the former rulers, but Polyphron, at least, seems to have set him the example.<ref name=\"xh\"/>  The states of [[Thessaly]], which had previously acknowledged the authority of [[Jason of Pherae]],<ref name=\"ds\"/> were not so willing to submit to Alexander the tyrant, (especially the old family of the [[Aleuadae]] of [[Larissa]], who had most reason to fear him).  Therefore, they applied for help from [[Alexander II of Macedon]].\n\nAlexander prepared to meet his enemy in [[Macedon]]ia, but the king anticipated him, and, reaching [[Larissa]], was admitted into the city.  Alexander withdrew to [[Pherae]] whilst the Macedonian King placed a garrison in Larissa, as well as in [[Crannon]], which had also come over to him.<ref name=\"ds\"/>  But once the bulk of the Macedonian army had retired, the states of Thessaly feared the return and vengeance of Alexander, and so sent for aid to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbour who might otherwise become too formidable.  Thebes accordingly dispatched [[Pelopidas]] to the aid of Thessaly.  On arrival of Pelopidas at Larissa, whence according to Diodorus, he dislodged the Macedonian garrison, Alexander presented himself and offered submission.  When Pelopidas expressed indignation at the tales of Alexander's profligacy and cruelty, Alexander took alarm and fled.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 67</ref><ref name=\"plut\">[[Plutarch]], ''Pelop.'' p. 291-297, d.</ref>\n\nThese events appear to refer to the early part of 368 BC.  In the summer of that year Pelopidas was again sent into [[Thessaly]], in consequence of fresh complaints against Alexander.  Accompanied by [[Ismenias]], he went merely as a negotiator, without any military force, and was seized by Alexander and thrown into prison.<ref name=\"plut\"/><ref name=\"ds2\">[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 71-75</ref><ref>[[Polybius]], viii. 1</ref>  The scholar [[William Mitford]] suggested that Pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle, but the language of [[Demosthenes]] hardly supports such an inference.<ref name=\"demo\">[[Demosthenes]], ''Against Aristocrates'' p. 660</ref><ref>[[William Mitford]], ''History of Greece'' ch. 27. sec. 5</ref>  The Thebans sent a large army into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas, but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of Alexander, who, aided by auxiliaries from [[Athens]], pursued them with great slaughter.  The destruction of the whole Theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of [[Epaminondas]], who was serving in the campaign, but not as general.\n\nIn 367 BC Alexander carried out a massacre of the citizens of [[Scotussa]].<ref name=\"plut\"/><ref name=\"ds2\"/><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' vi. 5</ref>  A fresh Theban expedition into [[Thessaly]], under [[Epaminondas]] resulted, according to [[Plutarch]], in a three-year truce and the release of prisoners, including Pelopidas.<ref name=\"plut\"/><ref name=\"ds2\"/>  During the next three years, Alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of Thessaly, especially [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] and [[Phthiotis]],<ref name=\"plut\"/> for upon the expiry of the truce, in 364 BC, they again applied to Thebes for protection from him.  The Theban army under Pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an [[eclipse]] (on 13 July 364 BC, see [[List of solar eclipses in the 4th century BC|4th century BC eclipses]]), and Pelopidas, leaving the bulk of his army behind, entered Thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries. At [[Battle of Cynoscephalae (364 BC)|Cynoscephalae]], the Thebans defeated Alexander, but Pelopidas was killed.<ref name=\"plut\"/><ref name=\"ds3\">[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 80</ref>  This was closely followed by another Theban victory under Malcites and Diogiton.  Alexander was then forced to restore the conquered towns to the Thessalians, confine himself to Pherae, join the [[Boeotian League]], and become a dependent ally of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].<ref name=\"xh\"/><ref name=\"plut\"/><ref name=\"ds3\"/>\n\nIf the death of [[Epaminondas]] in 362 freed Athens from fear of Thebes, it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from Alexander, who made a piratical raid on [[Tinos]] and other cities of the [[Cyclades]], plundering them, and making slaves of the inhabitants.  He also besieged [[Peparethus]], and \"even landed troops in Attica itself, and seized the port of Panormus, a little eastward of [[Sounion]].\"  The Athenian admiral [[Leosthenes]] defeated Alexander and managed to relieve Peparethus, but Alexander escaped from being blockaded in Panormus, took several Attic [[trireme]]s, and plundered the [[Piraeus]].<ref name=\"wess\"/><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 95</ref><ref>[[Polyaenus]], vi. 2</ref><ref>[[Demosthenes]], ''c. Polycl.'' pp. 1207-1208</ref><ref>[[Connop Thirlwall]], ''History of Greece'' vol. v. p. 209</ref>\n\n==Death==\nThe murder of Alexander is assigned by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] to 357/356.  [[Plutarch]] gives a detailed account of it, with a lively picture of the palace.  Guards watched throughout the night, except at Alexander's bedchamber, which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door.  Thebe, Alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister, as the daughter of [[Jason of Pherae]]),<ref name=\"plut\"/> concealed her three brothers in the house during the day, had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber.  Though she had taken away Alexander's sword, they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him.  Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander.  His body was cast into the streets, and exposed to every indignity.\n\nOf Thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given.  [[Plutarch]] states it to have been fear of her husband, together with hatred of Alexander's cruel and brutal character, and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of Pelopidas, when she visited him in his prison.  In [[Cicero]] the deed is ascribed to jealousy.  Other accounts have it that Alexander had taken Thebe's youngest brother as his [[eromenos]] and tied him up.  Exasperated by his wife's pleas to release the youth, he murdered the boy, which drove her to revenge.<ref name=\"plut\"/><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], xvi. 14</ref><ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 37</ref><ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'' 7</ref><ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Inventione]]'' ii. 49</ref><ref>Aristot. ''ap. [[Cicero]] [[De Divinatione|de Div.]] i. 25; the dream of Eudemus</ref>\n\n==Other==\nIt is written in [[Plutarch]]'s Second Oration On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great (see ''[[Moralia]]''), and in [[Claudius Aelianus]]' [[Claudius Aelianus#Varia Historia|''Varia Historia'']] that Alexander left a tragedy in a theatre because he did not wish to weep at fiction when unmoved by his own cruelty.<ref>Augustine, trans. Henry Chadwick. Confessions. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1991. Page 15. Print.</ref>  This suggests that while Alexander was a tyrant, perhaps his iron heart could be softened.  The actor was threatened with punishment because Alexander was so moved while watching.<ref>Aelianus Varia Historia xiv. 40.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Other sources===\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alexander (despot of Pherae)|display=Alexander|volume=1|page=552}}\n*{{SmithDGRBM|title=Alexander |page=124}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{SHORTDESC:4th-century BC Greek ruler of Thessaly}}\n\n[[Category:4th-century BC Greek people]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek rulers]]\n[[Category:Thessalian kings]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greeks who were murdered]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:350s BC deaths]]", "sha1": "oprnh5wjc75x14dkdpi7kc9k8btjja7"}}, {"title": "Alexander II of Epirus", "ns": "0", "id": "1588", "revision": {"id": "786254517", "parentid": "764802309", "timestamp": "2017-06-18T07:54:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "\u092a\u093e\u091f\u0932\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930", "id": "29495465"}, "comment": "/* Relations with India */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Coin of Alexander II of Epirus.png|right|thumb|250px|Illustration of silver coin of Alexander]]\n'''Alexander II''' was a king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], and the son of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].<ref name=\"DGRBM\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 116 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=131;page=root;view=image}}</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nHe succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of [[Macedon]].\nHe was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns.

He was elected Grand Duke of Lithuania on the death of his father (1492), and King of Poland on the death of his brother [[John I Albert]] (1501).\n\n==Biography==\n'''Alexander''' was born as son of the King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] of [[Poland]] and [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth Habsburg of Hungary]], daughter of the King [[Albert of Hungary]]. Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility ([[szlachta]]), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position. For want of funds, Alexander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Knights]] or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] from ravaging [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with the [[Tatars]]. The most the Grand Duke of Lithuania could do was to garrison [[Smolensk]] and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous [[Battle of Vedrosha]] (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state.\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Alexander Jagiellonczyk.svg|thumb|left|200px|Coat of Arms of Alexander I Jagiellon]]\n\nDuring his reign, Poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, [[Moldavia]]. Only the death of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the [[Danube River]]; while the liberality of [[Pope Julius II]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Alexander [[Peter's Pence]] and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.\n\nAlexander Jagellon never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow Lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate [[Michael Glinski]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at [[Kleck]] (5 August 1506), news of which was brought to Alexander on his deathbed in [[Vilnius]].\n\nIt is important to note that Alexander was the last known ruler of the [[Gediminids]] dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral [[Lithuanian language]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From his death, Polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully [[Polonisation|Polonising]] the [[Jagiello]] family.\n\nIn 1931, during the refurbishment of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], the forgotten sarcophagus of Alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Johann_Haller,_Commune_Incliti_Poloniae_regni_privilegium_constitutionum_et_indultuum_publicitus_decretorum_approbatorumque_(1506,_cropped).jpg|King Alexander in [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Polish Senate]], 1506.\nFile:Kanclerz.jpg|Alexander and his ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Jan \u0141aski]].\nFile:Vilnius.Sv.Onos baznycia.Saint Ann's church2.jpg|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Anne's Church, Vilnius|St. Anne's Church]] in [[Vilnius]] was constructed on his initiative in 1495\u20131500. \nFile:Krakow Wawel 20070804 0930.jpg|In 1504 he ordered to rebuild the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel]] in a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.<ref>[http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=4 Wawel Castle].

Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the [[ballet]], Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|pp=561-562}} More than six feet tall (about 1.9&nbsp;m), he was also noted for his immense physical strength. A [[sebaceous cyst]] on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.\n\nAn account from the memoirs of the artist [[Alexander Benois]] gives one impression of Alexander III:\n\n<blockquote>After a performance of the ballet ''[[Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule|Tsar Kandavl]]'' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]], I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the [[muzhik]] ''[Russian peasant]'' about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.</blockquote>\n\n===Education===\nThough he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Nicholas]], who seemed of robust constitution. Even when Nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], daughter of [[King Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]], and whose siblings included [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]], [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[King George I of Greece]]. Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as [[tsesarevich]], whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with [[French language|French]], English and [[German language|German]], and [[military drill]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n===As Tsesarevich===\n[[File:Alexander III and Maria Fedorovna's coronation by G.Becker (1888, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grand painting by artist Georges Becker of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]], which took place on {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1883|15 May}} at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Uspensky Sobor]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. On the left of the [[dais]] can be seen his young son and heir, [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsesarevich Nicholas]], and behind Nicholas can be seen a young [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George]].]]\nAlexander became [[Tsesarevich]] upon Nicholas's sudden death in 1865; it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], then a professor of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at [[Moscow State University]] and later (from 1880) [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]] of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought was an essential factor of Russian [[patriotism]] to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was [[heir apparent]] from 1865 to 1881 Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\nOn his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fianc\u00e9e, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} This wish was swiftly realized when on {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1866|28 October}} in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Alexander wed Dagmar, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]]. The union proved a happy one to the end; unlike his father's, there was no adultery in his marriage. The couple spent their wedding night at the Tsesarevich's private dacha known as \"My Property\".\n\nLater on the Tsesarevich became estranged from his father; this was due to their vastly differing political views, as well was his resentment towards Alexander II's long-standing relationship with [[Catherine Dolgorukov]] (with whom he had several illegitimate children) while his mother, the [[Marie Alexandrovna, Tsarina of Russia|Empress]], was suffering from chronic ill-health.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003) p. 94</ref> To the scandal of many at court, including the Tsesarevich himself, Alexander II married Catherine a mere month after Marie Alexandrovna's death in 1880.\n\n==Reign==\nOn 1 March 1881 (O.S.) Alexander's father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was assassinated by members of the [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[The people\u2019s will]]. As a result, he ascended to the Russian imperial throne in [[Ninasi|Nennal]] on 13 March 1881. He and Maria Feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Moscow]] on 27 May 1883. Alexander's ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of [[Pogrom|anti-Jewish riots]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1132-alexander-iii-alexandrovich-emperor-of-russia|title=ALEXANDER III., ALEXANDROVICH, Emperor of Russia - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>[http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/annoshow?call=dib|18830607|1|100.0|0 \"Die Judenverfolgung in Ru\u00dfland in der Kr\u00f6nungswoche\"] (in German), ''Das Interessante Blatt'', 7 June 1883.</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/06/01/102825816.pdf \"Rioting and Politics in Russia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 June 1883.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Pogroms|title=YIVO - Pogroms|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic policies===\n[[File:Alexander-Maria.jpg|thumb|Alexander and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]] on holiday in [[Copenhagen]] in 1893]]\n\nOn the day of his assassination Alexander II had signed an [[ukaz]] setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch. On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took Pobedonostsev's advice and canceled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his [[autocracy]] would not be limited.\n\nAll of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation. Alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, as well as one form of administration. He attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the [[Russian language]] throughout the empire, including to his [[Germans in Russia|German]], [[Poles|Polish]], and other non-Russian subjects (with the exception of the [[Finns]]), by the patronization of [[Eastern Orthodox]]y,  by the destruction of the remnants of German, Polish, and [[Sweden|Swedish]] institutions in the respective provinces, and by the weakening of [[Judaism]] through persecution of the [[Jew]]s. The latter policy was implemented in the \"[[May Laws]]\" of 1882, which banned Jews from inhabiting rural areas and [[shtetl]]s (even within the [[Pale of Settlement]]) and restricted the occupations in which they could engage.<ref>{{cite web|title =This day, May 15, in Jewish history|url= http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/cjnconnect/blogs/article_057a78b4-3f44-5375-a20d-a850a62b2194.html|publisher= Cleveland Jewish News}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander III reception by Repin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Alexander receiving rural district elders in the yard of Petrovsky Palace in Moscow; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n\nAlexander weakened the power of the ''[[zemstvo]]'' (elective local administrative bodies resembling British [[Parish councils in England|parish council]]s) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These \"land captains\" (''zemskiye nachalniki'') were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control.\n\nIn such policies Alexander III had the encouragement of [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as \"Toporov\" in Tolstoy's novel ''Resurrection''.) Other conservative advisors included Count [[Dmitry Tolstoy|D. A. Tolstoy]] (minister of education, and later of internal affairs) and [[Ivan Durnovo|I. N. Durnovo]] (D. A. Tolstoy's successor in the latter post). [[Mikhail Katkov]] and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy.\n\nEncouraged by its successful assassination of Alexander II, the [[Narodnaya Volya]] movement began planning the murder of Alexander III. The [[Okhrana]] uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators, including [[Alexander Ulyanov]], the older brother of [[Vladimir Lenin]], were captured and hanged on {{OldStyleDate|20 May|1887|8 May}}. \n\nThe famine of 1891\u20131892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity, as the Russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief (among others, [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] helped organize soup-kitchens, and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] directed anti-cholera precautions in several villages).\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Borki cathedral.jpg|thumb|The Borki Cathedral was one of many churches built to commemorate the Tsar's \"miraculous\" survival in the train crash.]]\n{{Main|Foreign policy of the Russian Empire}}\nIn foreign affairs Alexander III was a man of peace, but not at any price, and held that the best means of averting war is to be well-prepared for it. Diplomat [[Nikolay Girs]], scion of a rich and powerful family of Scandinavian descent, served as his Foreign Minister, 1882-1895, and established the peaceful policies for which Alexander has been given credit. Girs was an architect of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1891, which was later expanded into the [[Triple Entente]] with the addition of Great Britain. That alliance brought France out of diplomatic isolation, and moved Russia from the German orbit to a coalition with France, that was strongly supported by French financial assistance to Russia's economic modernization. Girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements, treaties and conventions. These agreements defined Russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations. The most dramatic success came in 1885, settling long-standing tensions with Great Britain, which was fearful that Russian expansion to the South would be a threat to India. <ref>Raymond A. Mohl, \"Confrontation in Central Asia, 1885,\" ''History Today'' (1969) 119#3 pp 176-183. </ref>  Girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of Tsar Alexander convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars.  With a deep insight into the tsar's moods and views, Girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists, ministers, and even the czarina, as well as his own ambassadors.  His Russia fought no wars.<ref>Margaret Maxwell,  \"A Re-examination of the R\u00f4le of N.K. Giers as Russian Foreign Minister under Alexander III.\" ''European Studies Review'' 1.4 (1971): 351-376.</ref>\n\nThough Alexander was indignant at the conduct of German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with [[German Empire|Germany]]&mdash;even reviving the [[League of Three Emperors]] for a period of time{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}&mdash;and in 1887, signed the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with the Germans. However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing; 2003) p. 162</ref> In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an [[Franco-Russian Alliance|alliance]] with the French in 1892.\n\nDespite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]] and afterwards of [[Stefan Stambolov|Stambolov]] to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}\n\nIn [[Central Asia]]n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking conflict with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] (see [[Panjdeh Incident]]), and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand. His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]]; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}\n\nAlexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at [[Langinkoski]] manor near [[Kotka]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.\n\n[[File:5 Roubles \u00e0 l'effigie du Tsar d'Alexandre III, 1888.jpg|thumb|left|5-ruble coin of Alexander III, 1888]]\n\nAlexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the [[Slavophiles]] and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\nSome differences had first appeared during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when Alexander II supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] while the Tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the [[Eastern Question]] excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the [[German Empire]], {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of \"honest broker\" at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with [[Austria-Hungary]] for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in [[Eastern Europe]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\nThe Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}\n\n=== Family life ===\n[[File:Tzar Alexander III and members of the Royal family.jpg|thumb|Left to Right: Emperor Alexander III, Prince George (later [[George V|George V of the United Kingdom]]), [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]], [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Maria of Greece]], Tsesarevich Nicholas (Later Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]]). Probably taken on the imperial yacht near Denmark, {{Circa|c.}} 1893.]]\n\nFollowing his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the [[Gatchina Palace]], located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the [[Anichkov Palace]], as opposed to the Winter Palace.\n\nIn the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in early 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved \"Dusenka\". On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fianc\u00e9e of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and his desire to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary \"Farewell, dear Dusenka.\" Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris, [[Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince of San Donato|Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince di San Donato]], fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son [[Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato|Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince di San Donato]]. Alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.\n\nAlexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] (b. 1868), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (b. 1871), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (b. 1875), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (b. 1878) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (b. 1882). Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two.  In 1885 it was Alexander who commissioned [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]] to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled Easter eggs (now called \"[[Faberg\u00e9 egg]]s\") for her as an Easter gift, the [[First Hen egg]], which delighted her immensely and became an annual Easter tradition for Alexander and, upon his succession, for his son Nicholas as well.\n\n[[File:Marble Palace (oriental frontage).jpg|thumb|left|Equestrian statue of Alexander III, by Prince [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], shows the Emperor sitting heavily on the back of a ponderous horse]]\n\nEach summer his parents-in-law, [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]], held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]], bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark.<ref name=\":0\">Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003), p. 151</ref> His sister-in-law, the [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]], would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law, [[King George I of Greece]], his wife, [[Queen Olga of Greece|Queen Olga]], who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens.<ref name=\":0\" /> In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison.<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\">Van Der Kiste, p. 152</ref> In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden]].<ref name=\"Van Der Kiste, p. 152\"/>\n\nAs Tsesarevich&mdash;and then as Tsar&mdash;Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir]]. This tension was reflected in the rivalry between Maria Feodorovna and Vladimir's wife, [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna]].<ref>Van Der Kiste, p. 141</ref> Alexander had better relationships with his other brothers: [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexei]] (whom he made rear admiral and then a grand admiral of the Russian Navy), [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei]] (whom he made governor of Moscow) and [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Paul]].\n\nDespite the antipathy that Alexander had towards his stepmother, [[Catherine Dolgorukov|Princess Catherine Dolgorukov]], he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the Winter Palace for some time after his father's assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him.

Alexander was named after [[Pope Alexander II]].\n\nHe was the younger brother of King [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], who was unmarried, and his brother's [[heir presumptive]] by 1104 (and perhaps earlier). In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of [[Saint Cuthbert]] at [[Durham, England|Durham]] prior to their re-interment. He held lands in Scotland north of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and in [[Lothian]].<ref name = \"ystlxt\">Barrow, p. 154.</ref>\n\nOn the death of Edgar in 1107 he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, their brother [[David I of Scotland|David]] was granted an [[appanage]] in southern Scotland. Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] or Cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar, Alexander, David and their brother-in-law [[Henry I of England]]. In 1113, perhaps at Henry's instigation, and with the support of his [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] allies, David demanded, and received, additional lands in [[Lothian]] along the Upper [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and [[River Teviot|Teviot]]. David did not receive the title of king, but of \"prince of the Cumbrians\", and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.<ref>Oram, pp. 60\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe dispute over Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David, although it was unpopular in some quarters. A [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] poem laments:<blockquote>It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,<br>dividing us from Alexander;<br>he causes, like each king's son before,<br>the plunder of stable Alba.<ref>Oram, p. 66 citing [[Thomas Owen Clancy|Clancy]], ''The Triumph Tree''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England. In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].<ref>Oram, p. 65.</ref> Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter [[Sybilla of Normandy]] may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.<ref>Oram, p. 65; a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of David and [[Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon|Maud of Huntingdon]].</ref>\n\n[[William of Malmesbury]]'s account attacks Sybilla, but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety.<ref>Duncan, p. 65; Oram, p. 71.</ref> Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at ''Eilean nam Ban'' ([[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]] on [[Loch Tay]]) in July 1122 and was buried at [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Alexander did not remarry and [[Walter Bower]] wrote that he planned an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at the ''Eilean nam Ban'' dedicated to Sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her [[Veneration|venerated]].<ref>Oram, p. 71.</ref>\n[[File:Alexander I (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|250px|The reverse of the [[seal (device)|seal]] of Alexander I, enhanced as a 19th-century steel engraving.]]\nAlexander had at least one illegitimate child, [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], who was later to be involved in a revolt against [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in the 1130s. He was imprisoned at [[Roxburgh]] for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.<ref>Oram, p. 77. The identity of this person may be still in question, see [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]].</ref>\n\nAlexander was, like his brothers Edgar and David, a notably pious king. He was responsible for foundations at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] and [[Inchcolm]]. His mother's chaplain and [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Thurgot]] was named [[Bishop of Saint Andrews]] (or ''Cell R\u00edgmonaid'') in 1107, presumably by Alexander's order.<ref name = \"ystlxt\"/> The case of Thurgot's would-be successor [[Eadmer]] shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Ralph d'Escures]], rather than [[Thurstan]] of [[Archbishop of York|York]]. Alexander also patronised [[Saint Andrews]], granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.<ref>Barrow, p. 156.</ref>\n\nFor all his religiosity, Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. [[John of Fordun]] says of him:\n{{quote|Now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.<ref>Fordun, V, xxviii ([[William Forbes Skene|Skene's]] edition).</ref>}}\n\nHe manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the [[Mormaerdom of Moray]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' says that Alexander was holding court at [[Invergowrie]] when he was attacked by \"men of the Isles\".<ref>Wyntoun, cxxvii.</ref> Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns. Alexander pursued them north, to \"Stockford\" in [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] (near [[Beauly]]) where he defeated them. This, says Wyntoun, is why he was named the \"Fierce\". The dating of this is uncertain, as are his enemies' identity. However, in 1116 the [[Annals of Ulster]] report: \"Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray.\" The king referred to is Alexander's father, Malcolm III, and Domnall was Alexander's half brother. The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Bethad mac Findl\u00e1ich) and [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach mac Gille Coemg\u00e1in): not overmighty subjects, but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime. Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known; it may have been [[\u00d3engus of Moray]] or his father, whose name is not known. As for the Mearns, the only known [[Mormaer of Mearns]], [[M\u00e1el Petair of Mearns|M\u00e1el Petair]], had murdered Alexander's half-brother [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] (Donnchad mac Ma\u00edl Coluim) in 1094.<ref>MacDonald, pp. 23\u201324, deals with this affair.</ref>\n\nAlexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother David, probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla, succeeded him.<ref>Oram, pp.71\u201372.</ref>\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n\nAlexander I has been depicted in a fantasy novel.:<ref name=\"Saint Andrews\">Saint Andrews, Brodrick (2010), p. 99-104</ref>\n* ''Pater Nostras Canis Dirus: The Garrison Effect'' (2010). Alexander is depicted troubled by his lack of direct heirs, having no child with his wife [[Sybilla of Normandy]]. He points that his father-in-law [[Henry I of England]] is asking them for a grandson.<ref name=\"Saint Andrews\"/>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He spent time in England ([[John of England]] knighted him at [[Clerkenwell Priory]] in 1213) before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 6 December the same year.\n\n==King of Scots==\n\nIn 1215, the year after his accession, the clans [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]], inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against [[John of England]], and led an army into the [[Kingdom of England]] in support of their cause.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexander II. (king of Scotland)|display=Alexander II.|volume=1|page=563}}</ref> This action led to the sacking of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] as John's forces ravaged the north.\n\nThe Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of [[Dover]] where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]] for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But [[John of England|John]] having died, the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son, [[Henry III of England|Henry]], forcing the French and the Scots armies to return home.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_ii/ \"Alexander II, King of Scots 1214 \u2013 1249\", Scotland's History, BBC]</ref>\n\nPeace between Henry III, Louis of France, and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the treaty of Kingston. Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan of England]] on 18 June or 25 June 1221.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Alexander II (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|left|Alexander the warrior and knight: the reverse side of Alexander II's Great Seal, enhanced as a 19th-century steel engraving. Legend: {{lang|la|Alexander Deo rectore Rex Scottorum}} (Alexander, with God as his guide, king of the Scots)]]\n\nThe next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi-independent district of [[Argyll]] (much smaller than the modern area by that name, it only comprised [[Craignish]], [[Ardscotnish]], [[River Add|Glassary]], [[River Aray|Glenary]], and [[Cowal]]; [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorn]] was a separate province, while [[Kintyre]] and [[Knapdale]] were part of [[Scandinavian Scotland#|Su\u00f0reyar]]). Royal forces crushed a revolt in [[Galloway]] in 1235 without difficulty;<ref name=bbc/> nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success. Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This was the [[Treaty of York]] which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).\n\nJoan died in March 1238 in Essex.  Alexander married his second wife, [[Marie de Coucy]], the following year on 15 May 1239.

He belonged to the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.{{sfn|Kane|2014|p=12}}\n\nIn 1889, King Milan unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life, proclaiming Alexander king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age. His mother became his regent. His parents were second cousins. In 1893, King Alexander, aged sixteen, arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the [[regent]]s and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry. In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]] was one of strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}}\n\nIn 1894 the young King brought his father, Milan, back to Serbia and, in 1898, appointed him commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. During that time, Milan was regarded as the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}}\n\n==Marriage==\nIn the summer of 1900, King Alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed Madame [[Draga Ma\u0161in]], formerly a lady-in-waiting to his mother and 12 years his senior. The proposed union aroused great opposition: not only was Draga of unequal birth and from an obscure family, but at 36 years of age, the chances of her bearing an heir were slim. Alexander was an only child, and it was imperative to secure the succession.\n[[File:Aleksandar ob heinrich wassmuth 1894.jpg|thumb|King Alexander 1894.]]\nBefore making the announcement, Alexander did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in [[Karlovy Vary]] and making arrangements to secure the hand of [[Germany|German]] princess [[Prince William of Schaumburg-Lippe#Marriage|Alexandra zu Schaumburg-Lippe]] for his son, or his [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] Dr. Vladan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, who was visiting the [[Paris]] [[World Exhibition|Universal Exhibition]] at the time of the announcement. Both immediately resigned from their respective offices and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom. She was known to have been seen in the nearby countries, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.\n\nOpposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]'s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}}\n\n== Politics and the constitution ==\n[[File:King Alexander I Obrenovi\u0107 of Serbia and Queen Draga, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|King Alexander and Queen Draga]]\n[[File:Obrenoviceva vila u Smederevu.jpg|thumb|Summer residence of King Alexander in [[Smederevo]].]]\nKing Alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] of his own initiative, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers (''[[National Assembly of Serbia|skup\u0161tina]]'' and ''[[senate]]'').  This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of [[Draga Ma\u0161in|Queen Draga]], Lieutenant Nikodije, was to be proclaimed heir-presumptive to the throne.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}}\n\nMeanwhile, the independence of the [[senate]] and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Alexander. In March 1903 the King suspended the [[constitution]] for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state. This arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country.\n\n==Assassination==\n{{main|May Coup (Serbia)}}\nThe general impression was that, as much as the [[senate]] was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro]], who was married to [[Natalija Konstantinovic]], the granddaughter of [[Princess Anka Obrenovi\u0107]], an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir-presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.<ref name=\"njeg\">{{Cite web|last=Leroy |first=Pierre Olivier |url=http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php#footnotes |title=Biography of Prince Mihajlo Petrovic Njegos |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=The Njegoskij Fund Public Project |year=2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034426/http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nApparently to prevent Queen Draga's brother being named heir-presumptive, but in reality to replace Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 with [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] also known as \"Apis\", and Novak Perisic, a young Greek Orthodox militant who was in the pay of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]],<ref>C. L. Sulzberger, ''The Fall of Eagles'', p.202, Crown Publishers, New York, 1977</ref> as well as the leader of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] [[secret society]] which would assassinate [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914. Several politicians were also part of the conspiracy, and allegedly included former Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]].<ref name=\"Sulzberger, p.202\">Sulzberger, p.202</ref> The royal couple's [[The Old Palace|palace]] was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. (There is another possibility, used in a Serbian TV history series ''The End of the Obrenovi\u0107 Dynasty'' in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret [[panic room]] hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom. The room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace, but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen's wardrobe over it after the wedding.)\n\nThe conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of June 11, 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure.<ref name=\"Sulzberger, p.202\"/> The King was only 26 years old at the time of his death.

Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1249.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by [[Alan Durward]], [[Justiciar of Scotia]]. The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_iii/ \"Alexander III, King of Scots 1249 \u2013 1286\", Scotland's History, BBC]</ref>\n\nOn attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short.<ref name=bbc/> He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships. The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained only [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] in the area.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Death of astag by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|'Alexander III being Rescued from the Fury of a Stag by the Intrepidity of Colin Fitzgerald', by [[Benjamin West]].]]\n\n==Succession==\n\nAlexander had married [[Margaret of England|Margaret]] (his 4th cousin by [[Henry I of England]]), daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 25 December 1251.<ref name=\"MacArthur2017\">{{cite book|author=Margaret MacArthur|title=History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c8sDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Merkaba Press via PublishDrive|pages=25\u2013|id=PKEY:6610000020409}}</ref> She died in 1275, after they had had three children.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n:\n# [[Margaret of Scotland (Queen of Norway)|Margaret]] (28 February 1261 \u2013 9 April 1283), who married King [[Eric II of Norway]]<ref name=bbc/>\n# [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland]] (21 January 1264 [[Jedburgh]] \u2013 28 January 1284 [[Lindores Abbey]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]\n# David (20 March 1272 \u2013 June 1281 [[Stirling Castle]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]\n\nAccording to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: \"he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Herbert, ed.|title=Chronicle of Lanercost|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|date=1909|volume=6|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBNAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=he+used+never+to+forbear+on+account+of+season+nor+storm,+nor+for+perils+of+flood+or+rocky+cliffs,+but+would+visit+none+too+creditably+nuns+or+matrons,+virgins+or+widows+as+the+fancy+seized+him,+sometimes+in+disguise&source=bl&ots=yEItYRMs7g&sig=yz0Vs_BdYFi0hwh3YKOzFPyDQDM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9mPKzybLOAhWIRiYKHWgqAm4Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=he%20used%20never%20to%20forbear%20on%20account%20of%20season%20nor%20storm%2C%20nor%20for%20perils%20of%20flood%20or%20rocky%20cliffs%2C%20but%20would%20visit%20none%20too%20creditably%20nuns%20or%20matrons%2C%20virgins%20or%20widows%20as%20the%20fancy%20seized%20him%2C%20sometimes%20in%20disguise&f=false|accessdate=8 Aug 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander III monument, Kinghorn Fife.jpg|thumb|upright=0.88|left|Alexander III Monument at [[Kinghorn]]<ref name=nationalgalleries>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-13639-kinghorn-road-alexander-iii-monument-king \"Alexander III Monument, Kinghorn\", British Listed Buildings]</ref>]]Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance.

Alexander's dedication of ''On Fate'' to [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.  A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander.<ref name=\"Chaniotis\"/> His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], while proconsul of Asia.  The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher.  This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexander's corpus should be ascribed to his father.<ref>R.

Sharples, \"The Peripatetic school\", in David Furley (editor), (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine'', pages 159-160. Routledge</ref> In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that [[divine Providence]] extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.<ref name=\"sharples\"/> Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.<ref name=\"sharples\"/>\n\n==Influence==\nBy the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as \"the commentator\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u1f10\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}).<ref>Cf.

But see [[Jonathan Barnes]] et al., (1991), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle Prior Analytics 1.1-7'', page 4, who argue: \"In all these texts Alexander is indeed referred to by phrases such as 'the commentator' or 'Aristotle's commentator'; but these phrases are not honorific titles - they are ordinary referring expressions.

This alienated many in the [[Roman Army]] and led to a conspiracy to assassinate and replace him.\n\n==Early reign==\nBorn between 206-208,<ref>''Encyclopedia of Assassinations: More than 400 Infamous Attacks that Changed the Course of History'': \"Alexander Severus acceded to the throne of Rome in 222 while still in his 16th year\"</ref><ref>''The life of Severus Alexander'': \"The presumption therefore is that he was born in 207 or 208\"</ref> Severus Alexander became emperor when he was around 15 years old (though he could be 14 or 16), making him the youngest emperor in [[Roman Empire|Rome]]'s history, until the ascension of [[Gordian III]].

Maesa died in 223, leaving Mamaea as the sole influence upon Alexander's actions.{{cn|date=March 2018}} As a young, immature, and inexperienced adolescent, Alexander knew little about government, warcraft, or the role of ruling over an empire.

The northernmost army gained some success, fighting in mountainous territory favorable to the Roman infantry, but the southern army was surrounded and destroyed by Ardashir's skilful horse-archers, and Alexander himself retreated after an indecisive campaign, his army wracked by indiscipline and disease.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), chap.

Alexander's mother, Julia Mammaea, asked for Origen to tutor Alexander in [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nWhile Alexander was being educated in the Christian doctrines, the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. A new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after Alexander's success in the Persian war. In 234, the barbarians crossed the Rhine and Danube in hordes that even caused panic at the gates of Rome. The soldiers serving under Alexander, already demoralized after their costly war against the Persians, were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders.<ref>Campbell, 54</ref>\n\nAs word of the invasion spread, the Emperor took the front line and went to battle against the Germanic invaders. The Romans prepared heavily for the war, building a fleet to carry the entire army across. However, at this point in Alexander's career, he still knew little about being a general. Because of this, he hoped the mere threat of his armies would be sufficient to persuade the Germanics to surrender.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander Severus|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/alex-severus-index.html|publisher=Capitoline Museums}}</ref>  Severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among his legions.<ref name=\"Western Press Association\">{{cite book|title=Library of World History: Containing a Record of the Human Race from the Earliest Historical Period to the Present Time; Embracing a General Survey of the Progress of Mankind in National and Social Life, Civil Government, Religion, Literature, Science and Art, Volume 3|publisher=Western Press Association|location=New York Public Library|pages=1442}}</ref> Due to incurring heavy losses against the Persians, and on the advice of his mother, Alexander attempted to buy the Germanic tribes off, so as to gain time.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nIt was this decision that resulted in the [[Legionary|legionaries]] looking down upon Alexander. They considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be Emperor. Under these circumstances the army swiftly looked to replace Alexander.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Maximinus Thrax|Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus]] was the next best option.

By the time he and his mother arrived, the situation had settled, and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence, trying to bribe the German army to surrender was the more sensible course of action.{{cn|date=August 2018}} According to historians, it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity.

However, Lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory, that Alexander was murdered in Sicilia (located in Britain).{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThis theory has it that, in an open tent after his lunch, Alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops, who compared him to his cousin [[Elagabalus]], the divisive and unpopular Emperor whose own assassination paved the way for Alexander's reign. A German servant entered the tent and initiated the call for Alexander's assassination, at which point many of the troops joined in the attack. Alexander's attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the Emperor's assassination. Within minutes, Alexander was dead. His mother Julia Mamaea was in the same tent with Alexander and soon fell victim to the same group of assassins.<ref name=\"Valentine Nind Hopkins 240\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Medaglione con effigie di alessandro severo, 1490 ca.JPG|thumb|15th century depiction of Severus Alexander]]\nAlexander's death marked the end of the [[Severan dynasty]]. He was the last of the Syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale.<ref>Campbell, pg. 55</ref> After his death his economic policies were completely discarded, and the Roman currency was devalued; this signaled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], which brought the empire near to collapse.<ref name=\"The Saylor Foundation\"/>\n\nAlexander's death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for Roman emperors. Though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during Alexander's time, emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs.<ref name=\"Campbell, pg. 69\">Campbell, pg. 69</ref> Thus, Alexander's taking of his mother's advice to not get involved in battle, his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the Germanic threat, and the relative failure of his military campaign against the Persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers.<ref name=\"Campbell, pg. 69\">Campbell, pg. 69</ref> Indeed, Maximinus was able to overthrow Alexander by \"harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward\".<ref name=\"Campbell, pg. 69\">Campbell, pg. 69</ref> Yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor, the legions paved the way for a half-century of widespread chaos and instability.\n\nAlthough the Senate declared the emperor and his rule damned upon the report of his death and the ascension of a replacement emperor, Alexander was [[Apotheosis|deified]] after the death of Maximinus in 238.<ref>{{cite web|title=Severus Alexander|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Academic Edition.

a native of [[Pleuron, Aetolia|Pleuron]] in [[Aetolia]], although he spent the greater part of his life at [[Alexandria]], where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the

He had an office in the [[Library of Alexandria]], and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant. He spent some time, together with [[Antagoras]] and [[Aratus]], at the court of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]].<ref>[[Aratus]], ''Phaenomena et Diosem.'' ii. pp. 431, 443, &c. 446, ed.

A son of [[John Hyrcanus]], he inherited the throne from his brother [[Aristobulus I]], and married his brother's widow, Queen [[Salome Alexandra]]. From his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war, Alexander's reign has been generalized as cruel and oppressive with never ending conflict.{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=89}}\n\n== Family ==\nAlexander Jannaeus was the third son of John Hyrcanus, by his second wife. When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus' son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]] had Alexander and his brothers released from prison.\n\nAlexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne but also to Salome, [[Yibbum|the widow of his deceased brother, who had died childless]]; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her, he had two sons, the eldest, [[Hyrcanus II]] became high-priest in 62&nbsp;BC and [[Aristobulus II]] who was high-priest from 66 - 62&nbsp;BC and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]]. Like his brother he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the [[Sadducees]], his wife Salome on the other hand came from a [[pharisaic]] family (her brother was [[Simeon ben Shetach]] a famous pharisee leader), and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign. Like his father Alexander also served as the high priest. This raised the ire of the Rabbis who insisted that these two offices should not be combined. According to the Talmud, Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest (rumour had it that his mother was captured in Modiin and violated) and was not allowed to serve in the temple according to the rabbis, this infuriated the king and sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and persecute them until his death.\n\n== Conquests ==\n[[Image:Judea Alexander Janne\u00fcs.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under Alexander Jannaeus<br>{{legend|lime|situation in 103 BC}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]\n\n===War with Ptolemy Lathyrus===\nAlexander's first expedition was against the city of Ptolemais ([[Akko|Acre]]). While Alexander went forward to siege the city, Zoilus, ruler of the coastal city [[Dor, Israel|Dora]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Straton's Tower]] took the opportunity to see if he could perhaps save Ptolemais in hopes of gaining territory. Alexander's Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoilus's forces with little trouble. Ptolemais and Zoilus then requested aid from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], who had been cast out by his mother [[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]]. Ptolemy founded a kingdom in [[History of Cyprus|Cyprus]] after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=131}}\n\nPtolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town; but Alexander met him with treachery, arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him. When Alexander formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Ptolemy in good gesture, handed over Ptolemais, Zoilus, Dora, and Straton's Tower to Alexander.{{sfn|Sch\u00fcrer|Vermes|Millar|2014|p=116}} As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he invaded the [[Galilee|Galilee region]] capturing [[Shikhin|Asochis]].{{sfn|Davies|Finkelstein|1984|p=600}}{{sfn|Kasher|1998|p=80}} Ptolemy also initiated an attack upon [[Sepphoris]] but failed.{{sfn|Finegan|2015|p=223}}\n\nAlexander might easily have lost his crown and Judea its independence as the result of this battle, had it not been for the assistance extended by Egypt. Cleopatra's two Jewish generals, Helkias and Ananias, persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son Ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him. As a result, Ptolemy was forced to withdraw to Cyprus, and Alexander was saved. The Egyptians, as compensation for their aid, desired to annex Judea to their country, but considerations touching the resident Egyptian Jews, who were the main support of her throne, induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest. The Egyptian army withdrawn, Alexander found his hands free; and forthwith he planned new campaigns.{{sfn|Borgen|1998|p=84}}{{sfn|Bar-Kochva|2010|p=93}}\n\n=== Transjordan and coastal conquest ===\nAlexander captured [[Gadara]] and the strong fortress [[Amathus (Transjordan)|Amathus]] in the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] region; but, in an ambush set for him by Theodorus, ruler of Amathus, he lost the battle. Alexander was more successful in his expedition against the Hellenized coastal cities (what had once been [[Philistia]]), capturing [[Rafah|Raphia]] and [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]]. Finally, in 96 BC{{sfn|Negev|Gibson|2005}} Jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in a year-long siege, which he occupied through treachery, and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery. This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet of the [[Nabataean kingdom|Nabatean]] trade routes.{{sfn|Sch\u00e4fer|2003|pp=74 & 75}}\n\n== Judean Civil War ==\n=== War with Obodas I ===\n[[File:WillemSwiddeAlexanderJannaeus.jpg|thumb|Alexander Jannaeus feasting during the crucifixion of the Pharisees, engraving by [[Willem Swidde]], seventeenth century]]\nThe Judean Civil War initially began after the conquest of Gaza by Jannaeus around 96 BC. Due to Jannaeus's victory at Gaza, the Nabatean kingdom no longer had access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Alexander soon captured [[Gadara]], which caused the Nabateans to lose their main trade routes leading to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient City of Damascus|Damascus]].{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=117}} After losing Gadara, the Nabatean king [[Obodas I]] launched an attack against Alexander in a steep valley in Gadara where Alexander barely managed to escape. After Jannaeus was defeated in the [[Battle of Gadara]] against the Nabataeans, he returned to Jerusalem only to be met with fierce Jewish opposition.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=118}}\n\n=== Feast of Tabernacles ===\nDuring the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]], Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to perform the water [[libation]] ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet.{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}} The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting Alexander with the [[etrog]]im ([[citron]]s) that they were holding in their hands. Outraged, he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him, more than 6,000 people in the Temple courtyard were massacred. With further frustration, Alexander had wooden barriers built around the altars preventing people from sacrificing and denied daily offerings except for the priests. He also allied himself with foreign troops such as the [[Pisidia]]ns and the [[Cilicia]]ns who would later help his regime during the civil war.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=118}} This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opposition to Jannaeus.{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}}\n\n=== War with Demetrius III and the conclusion of the Judean Civil War ===\nAfter Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]] to fight against Jannaeus. Alexander had gathered 6,200 mercanaries and 20,000 Jews for battle as Demetrius had 40,000 soldiers and 3,000 horses. There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at [[Shechem]]. All of Alexander's mercenaries were killed in battle, and Alexander was forced to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, 6,000 Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. If fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returend to him continuned. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=118 & 119}}\n\nJannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had 800 Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexender later returned the land he had seized from the Nabateans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels, who numbered 8,000, fled by night in fear of Alexander. After, all rebel hostility ceased and Alexander's reign continued in peace.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|p=119}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Kenneth|title=Queen Salome: Jerusalem's Warrior Monarch of the First Century B.C.E|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786490738|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mFZsgugWF_UC&pg=PA130&dq=Alexander+Jannaeus+Ptolemais#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Jannaeus%20Ptolemais&f=false|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bar-Kochva|first1=Bezalel|title=The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520943636|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVbzRfhBwCEC&pg=PA93&dq=Alexander+Jannaeus+Ptolemy+IX+Lathyros#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Jannaeus%20Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros&f=false|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Borgen|first1=Peter|title=Early Christianity and Hellenistic Judaism|date=1998|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780567086266|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Nsx0qpB4_24C&pg=PA84&dq=Alexander+Jannaeus+Ptolemy+IX+Lathyros#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Jannaeus%20Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros&f=false|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=William David|last2=Finkelstein|first2=Louis|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: The early Roman period|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521243773|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW2BuWcalXIC&pg=PA600&dq=Alexander+Jannaeus+Asochis#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Jannaeus%20Asochis&f=false|ref=harv|year=1984}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Eshel|first1=Hanan|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmonean State|date=2008|publisher=Wm.

Against this, the Averroists, led by [[Agostino Nifo]], introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe Alexandrists, led by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied the Aristotle viewed the soul as immortal, because in their view, since they believed that Aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Attribution:'''\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Alexandrists|volume=1|page=576}}\n\n[[Category:Christian philosophers]]\n\n\n{{Christianity-stub}}", "sha1": "7oqig8sa0b8f3ayjrth5tk0yr1ihuz8"}}, {"title": "Alexios I Komnenos", "ns": "0", "id": "1613", "revision": {"id": "865352159", "parentid": "865310820", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T11:51:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cplakidas", "id": "613068"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Alexius I}}\n{{redirect|Alexios Komnenos}}\n{{Infobox Monarch\n|image          = Alexios I Komnenos.jpg\n|caption        =Portrait of Emperor Alexios&nbsp;I, from a Greek manuscript\n|succession     = [[List of Byzantine emperors|Emperor]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]]\n|reign          =1 April 1081<ref name=\"Alexiad, 2.10\">\"Alexiad\", 2.10</ref>{{snd}}15 August 1118\n|coronation     =5 April 1081<ref name=\"Alexiad, 3.2\">\"Alexiad\", 3.2</ref>\n|predecessor    =[[Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates]]\n|successor      =[[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]]\n|spouse         =[[Irene Doukaina]]\n|issue          ={{plainlist|\n*[[Anna Komnene]]\n*[[Maria Komnene (1085\u20131136)|Maria Komnene]]\n*[[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]]\n*[[Andronikos Komnenos (1091\u20131131)|Andronikos Komnenos]]\n*[[Eudokia Komnene (daughter of Alexios I)|Eudokia Komnene]]\n*[[Theodora Komnene (b. 1096)|Theodora Komnene]]\n*[[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Komnenos]]\n*[[Manuel Komnenos (b. 1097)|Manuel Komnenos]]\n*[[Zoe Komnene]]}}\n|full name      =\n|house          =[[Komnenos dynasty|Komnenoi]]\n|house-type=Dynasty\n|father         =[[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]]\n|mother         =[[Anna Dalassene]]\n|birth_date     =1048\n|birth_place    =\n|death_date     =15 August 1118 (age 70)\n|death_place    =\n|place of burial =\n||title=[[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans]]}}\n\n'''Alexios&nbsp;I Komnenos''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}, {{Circa|1048}} \u2013 15 August 1118), [[Latinization of names|Latinized]] '''Alexius I Comnenus''', was [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] from 1081 to 1118. Although he was not the founder of the [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]], it was during his reign that the Komnenos family came to full power. Inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the [[Seljuq Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in the western [[Balkans]], Alexios was able to curb the Byzantine decline and begin the military, financial, and territorial recovery known as the ''[[Komnenian restoration]]''. The basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by Alexios. His appeals to Western Europe for help against the Turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the [[Crusades]].\n\n== Life ==\nAlexios was the son of the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]] and [[Anna Dalassene]],<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 63\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 63</ref> and the nephew of [[Isaac&nbsp;I Komnenos]] (emperor 1057\u20131059). Alexios' father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081. Under one of these emperors, [[Romanos&nbsp;IV Diogenes]] (1067\u20131071), Alexios served with distinction against the [[Seljuq Turks]].<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 4\">Norwich 1995, p. 4</ref> Under [[Michael&nbsp;VII Doukas]] ''Parapinakes'' (1071\u20131078) and [[Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates]] (1078\u20131081), he was also employed, along with his elder brother [[Isaac Komnenos (brother of Alexios I)|Isaac]], against rebels in [[Asia Minor]], [[Thrace]], and in [[Epirus]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alexius I.|volume=1|page=577|first=John Bagnell|last=Bury|authorlink=J. B. Bury}}</ref>\n\nIn 1074, western mercenaries led by [[Roussel de Bailleul]] rebelled in Asia Minor,<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 2\">Norwich 1995, p. 2</ref> but Alexios successfully subdued them by 1076.<ref name=\"Alexiad, 1.1\">\"Alexiad\", 1.1</ref> In 1078, he was appointed commander of the field army in the West by Nikephoros&nbsp;III.<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 3\">Norwich 1995, p. 3</ref> In this capacity, Alexios defeated the rebellions of [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder]] (whose son or grandson later married Alexios' daughter Anna) and [[Nikephoros Basilakes]], the first at the [[Battle of Kalavrye]] and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Alexios was ordered to march against his brother-in-law [[Nikephoros Melissenos]] in Asia Minor but refused to fight his kinsman. This did not, however, lead to a demotion, as Alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of Southern Italy, led by [[Robert Guiscard]].\n\n===Conspiracy and revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates===\nWhile Byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition, the Doukas faction at court approached Alexios and convinced him to join a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against Nikephoros&nbsp;III. The mother of Alexios, Anna Dalassene, was to play a prominent role in this coup d'\u00e9tat of 1081, along with the current empress, [[Maria of Alania]].<ref name=\"Garland 2007\">Garland 2007</ref> First married to Michael&nbsp;VII Doukas and secondly to [[Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates]], she was preoccupied with the future of her son by Michael&nbsp;VII, [[Constantine Doukas (co-emperor)|Constantine Doukas]]. Nikephoros&nbsp;III intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives,<ref name=\"Finlay 1854, p. 59\">Finlay 1854, p. 59</ref> and this resulted in Maria's ambivalence and alliance with the Komnenoi, though the real driving force behind this political alliance was Anna Dalassene.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.2.1\u20132</ref>\n\nThe empress was already closely connected to the Komnenoi through Maria's cousin Irene's marriage to Isaac Komnenos,<ref name=\"Finlay 1854, p. 59\" /> so the Komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit. Furthermore, to aid the conspiracy Maria had adopted Alexios as her son, though she was only five years older than he.<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 5\">Norwich 1995, p. 5</ref> Maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own \"Alans\" and her eunuchs, who had been instigated by Isaac Komnenos. Given Anna's tight hold on her family, Alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> As a result, Alexios and Constantine, Maria's son, were now adoptive brothers, and both Isaac and Alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2,1,4\u20136, 2.3.2\u20133,2.3.4; cf. Bryennius 4.2, who dates the adoption to early in the reign of Botaneiates</ref> By secretly giving inside information to the Komnenoi, Maria was an invaluable ally.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.3.4,2.4.5</ref>\n\n[[File:Seal of Alexios Komnenos as Grand Domestic of the West.jpg|thumb|250px|Seal of Alexios as \"[[Domestic of the Schools|Grand Domestic of the West]]\"]]\n\nAs stated in the Alexiad, Isaac and Alexios left Constantinople in mid-February 1081 to raise an army against Botaneiates.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 6</ref> However, when the time came, Anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the [[Hagia Sophia]]. From there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital, while protesting her sons' innocence of hostile actions. Under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church, she deliberately excluded the grandson of Botaneiates and his loyal tutor, met with Alexios and Isaac, and fled for the forum of Constantine.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> The tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds, but Anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly. Then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church, the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from [[Cappadocia]] who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip. However, before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary, Straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives, her sons were loyal subjects (Alexios and Isaac were discovered absent without leave), and had learned of a plot by enemies of the Komnenoi to have them both blinded and had, therefore, fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.5</ref> She refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the [[Mother of God]] for protection. This request was granted and Anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities:\n\n{{quote|She was allowed to enter. As if she were weighed down with old age and worn out by grief, she walked slowly and when she approached the actual entrance to the sanctuary made two genuflections; on the third she sank to the floor and taking firm hold of the sacred doors, cried in a loud voice: \"Unless my hands are cut off, I will not leave this holy place except on one condition: that I receive the emperor's cross as guarantee of safety\".<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.6</ref>}}\n[[File:Alex1.png|thumb|right|200px|Alexios I. Manuscript illustration.]]\nNikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Straboromanos tried to give Anna his cross, but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath. She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith. He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross. At the emperor's further insistence, and for their own protection, they took refuge at the convent of Petrion, where they were eventually joined by [[Maria of Bulgaria]], mother of Irene Doukaina.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> Botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests. They were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news.<ref>\"Alexiad\", 2.5.7\u20139</ref> Anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt: she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city; she distracted the emperor, giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops; and she gave a false sense of security to Botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him.<ref name=\"Garland 2007\"/> After bribing the Western troops guarding the city, Isaac and Alexios Komnenos entered the capital victoriously on April 1, 1081.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 63</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Alexios was rumored to be the lover of Empress [[Maria Bagrationi|Maria of Alania]], the daughter of King [[Bagrat&nbsp;IV of Georgia]], who had been successively married to [[Michael&nbsp;VII]] Doukas and his successor Nikephoros&nbsp;III Botaneiates, and who was renowned for her beauty.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 10</ref> Alexios arranged for Maria to stay on the palace grounds, and it was thought that he was considering marrying her. However, his mother consolidated the Doukas family connection by arranging the Emperor's marriage to [[Irene Doukaina]], granddaughter of the [[John Doukas, Caesar|Caesar John Doukas]], the uncle of Michael&nbsp;VII, who would not have supported Alexios otherwise. As a measure intended to keep the support of the Doukai, Alexios restored [[Constantine Doukas (co-emperor)|Constantine Doukas]], the young son of Michael&nbsp;VII and Maria, as co-emperor<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 12</ref> and a little later betrothed him to his own first-born daughter [[Anna Komnene|Anna]], who moved into the Mangana Palace with her fianc\u00e9 and his mother.\n\nThis situation changed drastically, however, when Alexios' first son [[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]] was born in 1087:<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 658\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 658</ref> Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, and she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother. Alexios became estranged from Maria, who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery, and Constantine Doukas was deprived of his status as co-emperor.<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 658\" /> Nevertheless, he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards.\n\n===Wars against the Normans, Pechenegs, and Tzachas===\n{{Details|Byzantine-Norman Wars}}\n\nThe nearly thirty-seven year reign of Alexios was full of struggle. At the outset he faced the formidable attack of the Normans, led by [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemund]], who took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]] and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]]<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}} Alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success. He enhanced his resistance by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy,<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 21</ref> which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083\u201384. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. Henry's allegiance would be the last example of Byzantine political control on peninsular Italy. The Norman danger subsided with the death of Guiscard in 1085, and the Byzantines recovered most of their losses.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 25</ref>\n\nAlexios next had to deal with disturbances in [[Thrace]], where the heretical sects of the [[Bogomils]] and the [[Paulicians]] revolted and made common cause with the [[Pechenegs]] from beyond the [[Danube]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 101</ref> Paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during Alexios' battles with the Normans.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 78</ref> As soon as the Norman threat had passed, Alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters, confiscating their lands. This led to a further revolt near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and the commander of the field army in the west, Gregory Pakourianos, was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle. In 1087 the Pechenegs raided into Thrace, and Alexios crossed into [[Moesia]] to retaliate but failed to take Dorostolon ([[Silistra]]).<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 102</ref> During his retreat, the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the Pechenegs, who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money. In 1090 the Pechenegs invaded Thrace again,<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 104</ref> while [[Tzachas]], the brother-in-law of the Sultan of [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Rum]], launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of Constantinople with the Pechenegs.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 26</ref> Alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40,000 [[Cumans]], with whose help he crushed the Pechenegs at [[Battle of Levounion|Levounion]] in Thrace on 29 April 1091.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 27</ref>\n\nThis put an end to the Pecheneg threat, but in 1094 the Cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the Balkans. Led by a pretender claiming to be [[Constantine Diogenes (pretender)|Constantine Diogenes]], a long-dead son of the Emperor [[Romanos&nbsp;IV]],<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 86</ref> the Cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern Thrace until their leader was eliminated at [[Adrianople]]. With the Balkans more or less pacified, Alexios could now turn his attention to [[Asia Minor]], which had been almost completely overrun by the [[Seljuq Turks]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 108</ref>\n\n===Byzantine-Seljuq Wars and the First Crusade===\n{{further|Byzantine-Seljuq Wars|First Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|right|thumb|300px|{{center|Europe in 1097, during the [[First Crusade]]}}]]\n\nBy the time Alexios ascended the throne, the Seljuqs had taken most of Asia Minor. Alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the Seljuq camps, but these victories were unable to stop the Turks altogether.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 111</ref> As early as 1090, Alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the [[Papacy]],<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 30</ref> with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before [[Pope Urban&nbsp;II]] at the [[Council of Piacenza]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} The help he sought from the West was simply some [[mercenary]] forces, not the immense hosts that arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment, after the pope preached the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] later that same year.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 31</ref> Not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories, the emperor saw his Balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 33</ref> Alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of Crusaders, led by the preacher [[Peter the Hermit]], by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in 1096.<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479\">Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479</ref>\n\nThe second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to [[Constantinople]], led in sections by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], [[Raymond&nbsp;IV of Toulouse]], and other important members of the western nobility.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 36</ref> Alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived, extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 123</ref> Transferring each contingent into Asia, Alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage. The crusade was a notable success for Byzantium, as Alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands. The [[siege of Nicaea]] by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097, and the subsequent crusader victory at [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Dorylaion]] allowed the Byzantine forces to recover much of western Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 42\">Norwich 1995, p. 42</ref> [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]] re-established Byzantine rule in [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sardis]], and [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] in 1097\u20131099. This success is ascribed by Alexios' daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1099, a Byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing [[Laodicea in Syria|Laodicea]] and other coastal towns as far as [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the Byzantine contingent under [[Tatikios]] failed to help them during the [[siege of Antioch]];{{cn|date=August 2018}} Bohemund, who had set himself up as [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]],<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 42\" /> [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|briefly went to war]] with Alexios in the Balkans, but he was blockaded by the Byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of Alexios by the [[Treaty of Devol]] in 1108.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 48</ref>\n\nIn 1116, though already terminally ill, Alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in Bythinia and Mysia to defend his Anatolian territories against the inroads of [[Malik Shah (R\u00fbm)|Malik Shah]], the Seljuq Sultan of Iconium. In 1117 he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the Turkish-dominated Anatolian Plateau, where he defeated the Seljuq sultan at the [[Battle of Philomelion]].{{sfn|Sewter|1969|pp=481\u2013487}}\n\n===Personal life===\nDuring the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 54</ref> The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] and [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] heresies<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 81</ref>\u2014one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake [[Basil the Physician|Basil]], a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479\" /> In spite of the success of the First Crusade, Alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the Seljuqs in 1110\u20131117.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 58</ref>\n\nAlexios was for many years under the strong influence of an ''eminence grise'', his mother [[Anna Dalassene]], a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene Doukaina.<ref>Norwich 1995, p. 59</ref> Dalassene was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexios' long absences in military campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Komnene.\n\n===Succession===\nAlexios' last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession. Although he had crowned his son [[John&nbsp;II Komnenos]] co-emperor at the age of five in 1092, his wife, Irene Doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of their daughter Anna and Anna's husband, [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger]].<ref name=\"Norwich 1995, p. 61\">Norwich 1995, p. 61</ref> Bryennios had been made ''[[Caesar (title)|kaisar]]'' (Caesar) and received the newly created title of ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' (\"honoured above all\"), and remained loyal to both Alexios and John. Nevertheless, the intrigues of Irene and Anna disturbed even Alexios' dying hours.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Pretenders and rebels==\nApart from all of his external enemies, a host of rebels also sought to overthrow Alexios from the imperial throne, thereby posing another major threat to his reign.<ref name=\"Kazhdan 1991, p. 1479\" />  Due to the troubled times the empire was enduring, he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the Byzantine emperors.<ref name=\"Finlay 1854, p. 71\">Finlay 1854, p. 71</ref>  These included:\n\n===Pre First Crusade===\n* [[Raictor]], a Byzantine monk who claimed to be the emperor [[Michael&nbsp;VII]].

In an attempt to have her return to [[Constantinople]], the conspirators produced pamphlets that mocked and slandered the empress, and left them in her tent. A search for the author of the publications uncovered the whole plot, yet Aron was only banished due to his connection of the royal line of Bulgaria, whose blood also flowed in the veins of the empress Irene.<ref>Finlay 1854, p. 75</ref>\n\n==Reform of the monetary system==\n[[File:Hyperryron-Manuel I-sb1965.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scyphate]] (cup-shaped) ''hyperpyron'' minted under [[Manuel I Komnenos]]]]\nUnder Alexios the debased ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' (''[[tetarteron]]'' and ''[[histamenon]]'') was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness (generally .900\u2013.950) was established in 1092, commonly called the ''[[hyperpyron]]'' at 4.45 grs.

According to the ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century encyclopedia, Alexis was the paternal uncle of the dramatist [[Menander]] and wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments now survive, including some 130 preserved titles.\n\n==Life==\nIt was said he had a son, called Stephanus, who also wrote comedies.<ref>''Suda'' ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b7\u03c2}}</ref> He appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table, according to [[Athenaeus]].<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/><ref>Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'' viii. p. 344''</ref>\n\nHe won his first [[Lenaean]] victory in the 350s BC, most likely, where he was sixth after [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]], and fourth after [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]].  While being a Middle Comic poet, Alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of New Comedy, such as Philippides, [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]], [[Diphilus]], and even Menander. There is also some evidence that, during his old age, he wrote plays in the style of New Comedy.\n\n[[Plutarch]] says that he lived to the age of 106 and 5 months, and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Defect. Orac.'' p. 420 e</ref> He was certainly alive after 345 BC, for [[Aeschines]] mentions him as alive in that year. He was also living at least as late as 288 BC,<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/> from which his birth date is calculated. According to the ''[[Suda]]'' he wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments including some 130 titles survive. His plays include ''Meropis'', ''Ankylion'', ''Olympiodoros'', ''Parasitos'' (exhibited in 360 BC, in which he ridiculed [[Plato]]), ''Agonis'' (in which he ridiculed Misgolas), and the ''Adelphoi'' and the ''Stratiotes'', in which he satirized [[Demosthenes]], and acted shortly after 343 BC.\nAlso ''Hippeis'' (316 BC) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} (in which he referred to the decree of [[Sophocles]] against the philosophers), ''Pyraunos'' (312 BC), ''Pharmakopole'' (306 BC) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, ''Hypobolimaios'' (306 BC), and ''Ankylion''.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>\n\nBecause he wrote a lot of plays, the same passages often appear in more than 3 plays. It was said that he also borrowed from Eubulus and many other playwrights in some of his plays.<ref>Athenaeus, i. p.25, f.</ref> According to [[Carystius|Carytius of Pergamum]], Alexis was the first to use the part of the parasite.<ref>Athen. vi. p.235, f. This is incorrect, because [[Epicharmus of Kos|Epicharmus]] had already introduced it 250 years earlier. However, Alexis may have been the first to develop the part into its common form.</ref> Alexis was known in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times; [[Aulus Gellius]] noted that Alexis' poetry was used by Roman comedians, including [[Turpilius]] and possibly [[Plautus]].\n\n==Surviving titles and fragments==\nOnly fragments have survived from any of Alexis's plays \u2013 about 340 in all, totaling about 1,000 lines. They attest to the author's wit and refinement, which Athenaeus praises.<ref>Athenaeus. ii. p.59, f.</ref> The surviving fragments also show that Alexis invented a great many words, mostly compound words, that he used normal words in an unusual way, and made strange and unusual forms of common words. The main sources of the fragments of Alexis are [[Stobaeus]] and Athenaeus.\n\nThe following 139 titles of Alexis's plays have been preserved:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*''Achaiis'' (\"The

She excluded her young son from power, entrusting it instead to Alexios the ''[[protosebastos|pr\u014dtosebastos]]'' (a cousin of Alexios II), who was popularly believed to be her lover. Friends of the young Alexios II now tried to form a party against the empress mother and the ''pr\u014dtosebastos''; Alexios II's half-sister Maria, wife of Caesar John ([[Renier of Montferrat]]), stirred up riots in the streets of the capital.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexius II.|volume=1|page=577|first=John Bagnell|last=Bury|authorlink=J. B. Bury}}</ref>\n\nTheir party was defeated on 2 May 1182, but [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos Komnenos]], a first cousin of Emperor Manuel, took advantage of the disorder to aim at the crown. He entered Constantinople, received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the government. His arrival was celebrated by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of 80,000 Latins]] in Constantinople, especially the [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, which he made no attempt to stop. He allowed Alexios II to be crowned but was responsible for the death of most of the young emperor's actual or potential defenders, including his mother, his half-sister, and the Caesar, and he refused to allow him any voice in public affairs.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Image:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Empire in 1180, when Alexios II became Emperor.]]\n\nThe betrothal in 1180 of Alexios II to [[Agnes of France, Byzantine Empress|Agnes of France]], daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Ad\u00e8le of Champagne]] and at the time a child of nine, had not apparently been followed by their marriage. Andronikos was now formally proclaimed as co-emperor before the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalk\u00e8]], and not long afterwards, on the pretext that divided rule was injurious to the Empire, he caused Alexios II to be strangled with a bow-string in October 1183.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> During the reign of Alexius II, the Byzantine Empire was invaded by King [[B\u00e9la III]], losing [[Syrmia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1181; later even [[Dalmatia]] was lost to the Venetians. [[Kilij Arslan II]] invaded the empire in 1182, defeating the Byzantines at the [[Siege of Cotyaeum]], resulting in the Empire losing [[Cotyaeum]] and [[Sozopolis, Pisidia|Sozopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Portrayal in fiction==\nAlexios is a character in the historical novel ''Agnes of France'' (1980) by [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]].

The most significant event of his reign was the attack of the [[Fourth Crusade]] on [[Constantinople]] in 1203, on behalf of [[Alexios IV Angelos]].  Alexios III took over the defense of the city, which he mismanaged, then fled the city at night with one of his three daughters. From [[Adrianople]], and then [[Mosynopolis]], he unsuccessfully attempted to rally his supporters, only to end up a captive of Marquis [[Boniface of Montferrat]]. He was ransomed, sent to Asia Minor where he plotted against his son-in-law [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]], but was eventually arrested and spent his last days confined to the Monastery of Hyakinthos in [[Nicaea]], where he died.\n\n==Early life==\nAlexios III Angelos was the second son of [[Andronikos Doukas Angelos]] and [[Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa]]. Andronikos was himself a son of [[Theodora Komnene (daughter of Alexios I)|Theodora Komnene]], the youngest daughter of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and [[Irene Doukaina]]. Thus Alexios Angelos was a member of the extended imperial family. Together with his father and brothers, Alexios had conspired against Emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] ({{circa|lk=no|1183}}), and thus he spent several years in exile in Muslim courts, including that of [[Saladin]].\n\nHis younger brother [[Isaac II Angelos|Isaac]] was threatened with execution under orders of Andronikos I, their first-cousin once-removed, on September 11, 1185. Isaac made a desperate attack on the imperial agents and soon killed their leader [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]]. He then took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] and from there appealed to the populace. His actions provoked a riot, which resulted in the deposition of Andronikos I and the proclamation of Isaac as Emperor. Alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Alexios III -Angelos.jpg|thumb|Alexios III from ''Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum'']]\nBy 1190 Alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother, from whom he received the elevated title of ''[[sebastokrator|sebastokrat\u014dr]]''.  In March 1195 while Isaac II was away hunting in [[Thrace]], Alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of Alexios' wife [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. Alexios captured Isaac at [[Stagira]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|put out his eyes]], and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner, despite having previously been redeemed by Alexios from captivity at [[Antioch]] and showered with honours.{{sfn|Bury|1911}}\n\nTo compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor, Alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. These actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state. At Christmas 1196, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] attempted to force Alexios to pay him a tribute of 5,000 pounds (later negotiated down to 1,600 pounds) of gold or face invasion. Alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the Holy Apostles and [[Alamanikon|taxing the people heavily]], though Henry's death in September 1197 meant the gold was never dispatched. The able and forceful empress Euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument in her attempts at reform, was [[assassination|assassinated]] by the emperor's orders.{{sfn|Bury|1911}}\n\nIn the east the Empire was overrun by the [[Seljuk Turks]]; from the north, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the rebellious [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]] descended unchecked to ravage the Balkan provinces of the Empire, sometimes penetrating as far as Greece, while Alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means. The Emperor's attempts to bolster the empire's defences by special concessions to [[pronoia]]rs (notables) in the frontier zone backfired, as the latter increased their regional autonomy. Byzantine authority survived, but in a much weakened state.\n\n==Fourth Crusade==\nSoon Alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger. In 1202, soldiers assembled at [[Venice]] to launch the [[Fourth Crusade]]. [[Alexios IV Angelos]], the son of the deposed Isaac II, had recently escaped from [[Constantinople]] and now appealed for support to the crusaders, promising to end the [[East-West Schism|schism]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|East]] and [[Roman Catholicism|West]], to pay for their transport, and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his father's throne.{{sfn|Bury|1911}}\n\nThe crusaders, whose objective had been [[Egypt]], were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, arriving there in June 1203, proclaiming Alexios IV as Emperor, and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle. Alexios III took no effective measures to resist, and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed. His son-in-law, [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]], who was the only one to attempt anything significant, was defeated at [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]], and the siege of Constantinople began. Unfortunately for the city, misgovernment by Alexios III had left the Byzantine navy with only 20 worm-eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived.\n\nIn July, the crusaders, led by the aged [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city. In the ensuing fighting, the crusaders set the city on fire, ultimately leaving 20,000 people homeless.  On 17 July Alexios III finally took action and led 17 divisions from the [[Gate of St. Romanus|St. Romanus Gate]], vastly outnumbering the crusaders. His courage failed, however, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight. His courtiers demanded action, and Alexios III promised to fight. Instead, that night (July 17/18), Alexios III hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Eirene, and as much treasure (1,000 pounds of gold) as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to [[Debeltos]] in Thrace, leaving his wife and his other daughters behind. Isaac II, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son, Alexios IV, in state.\n\n==Life in exile==\nAlexios III attempted to organize resistance to the new regime from [[Adrianople]] and then [[Mosynopolis]], where he was joined by the later usurper [[Alexios V Doukas|Alexios V Doukas ''Mourtzouphlos'']] in April 1204, after the definitive fall of Constantinople to the crusaders and the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]]. At first Alexios III received Alexios V well, even allowing him to marry his daughter [[Eudokia Angelina]]. Later Alexios V was blinded and deserted by his father-in-law, who fled from the crusaders into [[Thessaly]]. Here Alexios III eventually surrendered, with Euphrosyne, to Marquis [[Boniface of Montferrat]], who was establishing himself as ruler of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]].\n\nAlexios III attempted to escape Boniface's \"protection\" in 1205, seeking shelter with [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Captured by Boniface, Alexios and his retinue were sent to [[Montferrat]] before being brought back to [[Thessalonica]] in {{circa|1209}}. At that point the deposed emperor was ransomed by Michael I, who sent him to [[Asia Minor]], where Alexios' son-in-law Theodore Laskaris - now [[Empire of Nicaea|emperor of Nicaea]] - was holding his own against the Latins. Here Alexios conspired against his son-in-law after the latter refused to recognize Alexios' authority, receiving the support of [[Kaykhusraw I]], the [[Sultanate of Rum|sultan of R\u00fbm]]. In the [[Battle of Antioch on the Meander]] in 1211, the sultan was defeated and killed, and Alexios was captured by Theodore Laskaris. Alexios was then confined to a [[monastery]] at [[\u0130znik|Nicaea]],{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=717}} where he died later in 1211.\n\n==Family==\nBy his marriage to [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]], Alexios had three daughters:\n* Eirene Angelina, who married (1) Andronikos Kontostephanos, and (2) [[Alexios Palaiologos (despot)|Alexios Palaiologos]], by whom she was the grandmother of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].\n* [[Anna Angelina]], who married (1) the ''sebastokrat\u014dr'' Isaac Komnenos, great-nephew of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and (2) [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]], emperor of Nicaea.\n* [[Eudokia Angelina]], who married (1) Serbian King [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107]], then (2) Emperor [[Alexios V Doukas]], and (3) [[Leo Sgouros]], ruler of [[Corinth]].{{sfn|Finley, Jr.|1932|p=484}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n*[[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Alexius III.|volume=1|pages=577-578|first=John Bagnell|last=Bury|authorlink=J.

His family name was [[Doukas]], but he was also known by the nickname '''Mourtzouphlos''' or '''Murtzuphlus''' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}), referring to either bushy, overhanging [[eyebrow]]s or a sullen, gloomy character.<ref>Choniates, p. 307, (see also: Head, p. 238) says that Alexios Doukas gained the name 'Mourtzouphlos' in his youth from his companions on account of his eyebrows meeting and overhanging his eyes.</ref> He achieved power through a [[palace coup]], killing his predecessors in the process. Though he made vigorous attempts to defend Constantinople from the crusader army, his military efforts proved ineffective. His actions won the support of the mass of the populace, but he alienated the elite of the city. Following the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|fall]], sack, and occupation of the city, Alexios V was [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] by another ex-emperor and later executed by the new [[Latin Empire|Latin regime]]. He was the last Byzantine emperor to rule in Constantinople until the Byzantine [[recapture of Constantinople]] in 1261.\n\n==Origins and character==\nThough possessing the name of a leading Byzantine aristocratic family, there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos. The noble [[Doukas (Byzantine family)|Doukas]] clan were not the only Doukai, as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins. It has been claimed that Alexios Doukas was a great-great-grandson of the emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}) in the female line ([[cognatic]] descent). This is not improbable, as all other Byzantine emperors, and the majority of attempted usurpers, of the period had a connection with the former imperial house of the [[Komnenoi]], either by descent or marriage. A more precise theory has been proposed, that he was the son of an Isaac Doukas, and was the second cousin of [[Alexios IV Angelos]] ({{reign|1203|1204}}).<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 111</ref> A letter sent to [[Pope Innocent III]], stated that Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos was 'a blood relation' of Alexios IV Angelos.<ref>Akropolites, p. 112</ref>\n\nThe contemporary historian [[Niketas Choniates]] was dismissed from office as [[Logothetes ton sekreton|logothete of the ''sekreta'']] by Mourtzouphlos. His assessment of the emperor's character might therefore be biased; however, Choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature, though arrogant in his manner and lecherous.<ref>Choniates, pp. 311, 314</ref>\n\n==Political intrigues and usurpation==\n[[File:PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG|300px|thumb|The siege of Constantinople in 1204, by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]\nThe  participation of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of [[Alexios III Angelos]] ({{reign|1195|1203}}) by [[John Komnenos the Fat]] in 1200 had led to his imprisonment. Mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from 1201 until the restoration to the throne of [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195|1203|1204}}), the brother and predecessor of Alexios III. Isaac II, along with his son Alexios IV Angelos, were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in July 1203. On release, Mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' (head of the imperial finances). He had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Alexios III.<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 112-113</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of [[Constantinople]] with their efforts to protect the city from the [[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]] crusaders and their [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] allies, and the citizens were becoming restless. The crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors; they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. The fires affected about a sixth of the area of Constantinople and may have made up to a third of the population homeless; the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders. Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement in the city. He won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the Latins at \"Trypetos Lithos\"; in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had a band of youthful archers from the city not defended him. Mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the Latins to serve his personal ambition.<ref>Choniates, pp. 303\u2013304, 307</ref><ref>Madden (1992)</ref><ref>Madden (1995) p. 742</ref>\n\nThe citizens of Constantinople rebelled in late January 1204, and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named [[Nicholas Kanabos]] was acclaimed emperor, though he was unwilling to accept the crown. The two co-emperors barricaded themselves in the [[Palace of Blachernae]] and entrusted Mourtzouphlos with a mission to seek help from the crusaders, or at least they informed him of their intentions. Instead of contacting the crusaders, Mourtzouphlos, on the night of 28\u201329 January 1204, used his access to the palace to bribe the \"ax-bearers\" (the [[Varangian Guard]]), and with their backing arrest the emperors. Choniates states that Mourtzouphlos, when bribing the guards, had the help of a eunuch with access to the imperial treasury. The support of the Varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup, though Mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates. The young Alexios IV was eventually strangled in prison; while his father Isaac, both enfeebled and blind, died at around the time of the coup, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or mistreatment. Kanabos, after refusing to take office under Alexios V, took sanctuary in the [[Hagia Sophia]], but was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral.<ref>Choniates, pp. 307\u2013309</ref><ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, p. 118-120</ref><ref>Runciman, pp. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n==Emperor==\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades mourzoufle parleying with dandolo.jpg|thumb|right|Alexios V negotiating with Doge Enrico Dandalo, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nThe timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of Kanabos, and their relation to the coronation of Alexios V are problematic. Alexios V appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the [[Angeloi]] co-emperors. Hendrickx and Matzukis suggest that Alexios V assumed the imperial insignia immediately, but was crowned later, possibly on 5 February. Finding the treasury empty, the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use. These actions endeared Alexios V to the citizens, but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters. Once in firm control, Alexios V closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the [[Walls of Constantinople|fortifications]]. Sword in hand, he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies. On 2 February, [[Henry of Flanders]] led a part of the crusader army to Filea (or Phileas), in order to obtain food supplies. As he returned towards Constantinople Alexios V attacked his rearguard. The Byzantines were defeated and the imperial standard and an important icon of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] (the ''[[Panagia]] Nikopoios'') were captured. The Byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash, and Alexios V was lucky to escape alive. At about this time Alexios V attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with [[fire-ships]], but to little effect.<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 120\u2013122</ref><ref>Choniates, pp.311\u2013312</ref> \n\nThe loss of the icon, traditionally seen as a physical embodiment of divine protection for the city, was a severe psychological blow. Its possession by the crusaders convinced many of the population of Constantinople that the victory of the Westerners was now divinely sanctioned, as a punishment for the sins of the Byzantines.<ref>Giarenis, p. 78</ref>\n\nOn 8 February Alexios V met the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Enrico Dandolo]] for peace talks. The conditions demanded by the Venetian Doge, however, were too harsh for the Byzantines to consider. Choniates states that the meeting was brought to a close by an sudden attack by crusader cavalry on Alexios V and his entourage, the emperor narrowly escaping capture. According to Choniates, Alexios IV was killed the same day; the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death.<ref>Choniates, p.312</ref><ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 123\u2013124</ref> When news of the death of Alexios IV reached the crusaders, relations between them and Alexios V deteriorated further. The forcible expulsion of all Latins resident in Constantinople in March seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves regarding the [[Partitio Romaniae|partition]] of the Byzantine Empire. They also began to prepare for their final assault on the city, which took place the following month.<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\n==The fall of Constantinople, flight and death==\n[[File:Alexius V Doukas.jpg|thumb|right|Alexios V Doukas, from a 15th-century Byzantine manuscript]]\nThe defenders of Constantinople held out against a crusader assault on 9 April. The crusaders' second attack three days later, however, proved too strong to repel. Breaking through the walls near the [[Petria Gate]], the crusaders entered the city and looted the Blachernae Palace. Alexios V attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city, but with no success. Alexios V then boarded a fishing boat and fled the city towards [[Thrace]] on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. In the Hagia Sophia [[Constantine Laskaris]] was acclaimed as emperor, but being unable to persuade the Varangians to continue the fight, in the early hours of 13 April he also fled, leaving Constantinople under crusader control.<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 121\u2013127</ref><ref>Choniates, p.p. 313-314</ref>\n\nAlexios V and his companions eventually reached [[Mosynopolis]], which had been occupied by the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos and his followers. At first they were well received, with Alexios V marrying Eudokia Angelina. Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be made captive and [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]], thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne. Having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father-in-law, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis, or possibly in [[Anatolia]], by the advancing Latins under [[Thierry de Loos]] in November 1204.<ref>Falk, p. 163</ref><ref>Akropolites, p. 117</ref> On his return to Constantinople as a prisoner, Alexios V was tried for treason against Alexios IV. In his trial the blind ex-emperor argued that it was Alexios IV who had committed treason to his country, through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter Constantinople in force. On being condemned, he was executed by novel means: he was thrown to his death from the top of the [[Column of Theodosius]].<ref>Choniates, p. 334</ref> The new, alien, Latin regime of conquerors in Constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last \"legitimate emperor\" as a way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves. Alexios V was the last Byzantine Emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean Emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261.<ref>Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 127\u2013131</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n*[[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n*[[Sack of Constantinople (1204)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Akropolites, G.

He was born in [[Moscow]], the son of Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] and his first wife, [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]]. Alexei despised his father and repeatedly thwarted Peter's plans to raise him as successor to the throne. His brief defection to Austria scandalized the Russian government, leading to harsh repressions against Alexei and his associates. Alexei died after interrogation under torture, and his son [[Peter II of Russia|Peter Alexeyevich]] became the new heir apparent.\n\n==Childhood==\nThe young Alexei was brought up by his mother, who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards his father, the Tsar. Alexei's relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother, as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother's worst persecutor. From the ages of 6 to 9, Alexei was educated by his tutor Vyazemsky, but after the removal of his mother by Peter the Great to the [[Suzdal Kremlin#History|Suzdal Intercession Convent]], Alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners, who taught him history, geography, mathematics and French.\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1703, Alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a [[artillery|bombardier]] regiment. In 1704, he was present at the capture of [[Narva]]. At this period, the preceptors of the Tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability. Alexei had strong leanings towards [[archaeology]] and [[ecclesiology]]. However, Peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new [[Russia]], and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain Russia's new wealth and power. Painful relations between father and son, quite apart from the prior personal antipathies, were therefore inevitable. It was an additional misfortune for Alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood. He was left in the hands of [[reactionary]] [[boyars]] and priests, who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the Tsar.\n\n[[File:\u0428\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0442-\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0431\u044e\u0433\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Russia]]\nIn 1708 Peter sent Alexei to [[Smolensk]] to collect [[food|provender]] and recruits, and after that to [[Moscow]] to fortify it against [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. At the end of 1709, Alexei went to [[Dresden]] for one year. There, he finished lessons in French, German, mathematics and fortification. After his education, Alexei married [[Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Princess Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of Europe (i.e., Charlotte's sister [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Elizabeth]] was married to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]], ruler of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]). He met with Princess Charlotte, both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward. In theory, Alexei could have refused the marriage, and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended. \"Why haven't you written to tell me what you thought about her?\"  wrote Peter (in a tone that can only be guessed) in a letter dated  13 August 1710.\n\nThe marriage contract was signed in September. The wedding was celebrated at [[Torgau]], Germany, on  14 October 1711. One of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by Alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the Orthodox faith, Charlotte herself was allowed to retain her Protestant faith, an agreement opposed by Alexei's followers.\n\nAs for the marriage itself, the first 6 months went well but quickly became a failure within 6 months. Alexis was drunk constantly and Alexei pronounced his bride \"pock-marked\" and \"too thin\". He insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public.\n\nThree weeks later, the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to [[Toru\u0144]] to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland. For the next twelve months Alexei was kept constantly on the move. His wife joined him at Toru\u0144 in December, but in April 1712 a peremptory [[ukase]] ordered him off to the army in [[Pomerania]], and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through [[Finland]]. [[File:Alexei Petrovich in youth (Guen, 1703).jpg|thumb|Alexis in 1703]]\n\nHe had two children with Charlotte:\n*[[Grand Duchess Natalya Alexeyevna of Russia (1714\u20131728)|Natalia Alexeievna Romanova]] (3 March 1714 \u2013 3 November 1728)\n*[[Peter II of Russia|Peter Alexeyevich Romanov]] (23 October 1715 \u2013 30 January 1730)\n\nPeter Alexeyevich would succeed as the [[Emperor]] [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] in 1727. With his death in 1730, the direct male-line of the House of Romanov became extinct.\n\nAfter the birth of Natalia in 1714, Alexei brought his long-time Finnish serf [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Yefrosinya Fedorov|Afrosinia]]<ref>Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.115. Penguin Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.</ref> to live in the palace. Some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbase's disapproval of his foreign, non-Orthodox bride, more so than her appearance, that caused Alexei to spurn Charlotte. Another influence was [[Alexander Kikin]], a high-placed official who had fallen out with the Tsar and had been deprived of his estates.\n\n==Flight==\nImmediately on his return from Finland, Alexei was dispatched by his father to [[Staraya Russa]] and [[Lake Ladoga]] to see to the building of new ships. This was the last commission entrusted to him, since Peter had not been satisfied with his son's performance and his lack of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, Peter made one last effort to \"reclaim\" his son. On  11 October 1715, Charlotte died, after giving birth to a son, the grand-duke Peter, the future Emperor [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. On the day of the funeral, Peter sent Alexei a stern letter, urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state. Peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father's plans. Alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father, offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son Peter. Peter would agree but on the condition that Alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk.\n\nWhile Alexei was pondering his options, on 26 August 1716 Peter wrote to Alexei from abroad, urging him, if he desired to remain [[tsarevich]], to join him and the army without delay. Rather than face this ordeal, Alexei fled to [[Vienna]] and placed himself under the protection of his brother-in-law, the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], who sent him for safety first to the [[Tirol Castle|Tirol]]ean fortress of Ehrenberg (near [[Reutte]]), and finally to the castle of [[Sant'Elmo]] at [[Naples]]. He was accompanied throughout his journey by Afrosinia. That the emperor sincerely sympathized with Alexei, and suspected Peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son, is plain from his confidential letter to [[George I of Great Britain]], whom he consulted on this delicate affair. Peter felt insulted: the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal, and he had to be recovered and brought back to Russia at all costs. This difficult task was accomplished by Count [[Peter Tolstoi]], the most subtle and unscrupulous of Peter's servants.\n\n[[File:Peter the Great Interrogating the Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich.jpg|thumb|350px|''Peter I interrogates Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich at Peterhof'', history painting by [[Nikolai Ge]], 1871, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow]]\n\n==Return==\nAlexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing, that if he came back he should not be punished in the least, but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry Afrosinia.\n\nOn 31 January 1718, the tsarevich reached Moscow. Peter had already determined to institute a searching inquisition in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight. On 18 February a \"confession\" was extorted from Alexei which implicated most of his friends, and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand-duke Peter Petrovich. A brutal reign of terror ensued, in the course of which the ex-tsaritsa Eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged [[adultery]], while all who had in any way befriended Alexei were [[impalement|impaled]] or [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] while having their flesh torn with red-hot pincers or their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals, and were otherwise lingeringly done to death. Alexei's servants were beheaded or had their tongues cut out.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sebag Montefiore |first=Simon |date=2016 |title=The Romanovs |url= |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |page=123 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> All this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich.\n\nIn April 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from, and in regard to, Alexei. This included the words of Afrosinia, who had turned state's evidence. \"I shall bring back the old people...\" Alexei is reported to have told her,\n<blockquote>\"...and choose myself new ones according to my will;\nwhen I become sovereign I shall live in Moscow and leave Saint Petersburg simply as any other town; I won't launch any ships; I shall maintain troops only for defense, and won't make war on anyone; I shall be content with the old domains. In winter I shall live in Moscow, and in summer in [[Yaroslavl|Iaroslavl]].\"</blockquote>\n\nDespite this and other hearsay evidence, there were no facts to go upon. The worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father's death. In the eyes of Peter, his son was now a self-convicted and most dangerous traitor, whose life was forfeit. But there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to Russia. The whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of [[prelate]]s, [[Governing Senate|senator]]s, [[Minister (government)|ministers]] and other [[Dignitary|dignitaries]] on 13 June 1718. The [[clergy]], for their part, declared the Tsarevich Alexei,\n\n<blockquote>\"...had placed his Confidence in those who loved the ancient Customs, and that he had become acquainted with them by the Discourses they held, wherein they had constantly praised the ancient Manners, and spoke with Distaste of the Novelties his Father had introduced.\"</blockquote>\n\nDeclaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter, the clergy left the matter to the tsar's own decision.\n\nAt noon on 24 June, the temporal dignitaries\u2014the 126 members of both the Senate and magistrates that comprised the court\u2014declared Alexei guilty and sentenced him to death. But the examination by torture continued, so desperate was Peter to uncover any possible collusion.\n\nOn 19 June, the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty-five strokes with the [[knout]], and then, on the 24th, he was subject to fifteen more. On 26 June, Alexei died in the [[Peter and Paul fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father, and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother-in-law, the emperor.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Alexius Petrovich}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Matthew S.

Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the [[United States Army]] and served in both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \"common man\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=473}} against a \"corrupt aristocracy\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=219}} and to preserve the Union.\n\nBorn in the colonial [[Waxhaws|Carolinas]] to a [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] family in the decade before the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson became a [[American frontier|frontier]] lawyer and married [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson Robards]]. He served briefly in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] representing [[Tennessee]]. After resigning, he served as a [[List of Justices of the Tennessee Supreme Court|justice]] on the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the [[Creek War]] of 1813\u20131814, winning the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. The subsequent [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] required the [[Muscogee|Creek]] surrender of vast lands in present-day [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In the concurrent [[War of 1812|war against the British]], Jackson's victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] made him a national hero. Jackson then led U.S. forces in the [[First Seminole War]], which led to the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|annexation]] of [[Florida]] from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected [[John Quincy Adams]] in a [[contingent election]]. In reaction to the alleged \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" between Adams and [[Henry Clay]] and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].\n\nJackson ran again in [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]], defeating Adams in a landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by [[South Carolina]] over what opponents called the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]].\" The [[Nullification Crisis|crisis]] was defused when the tariff was [[Tariff of 1833|amended]], and Jackson [[Force Bill|threatened]] the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy [[Bank War|struggle]], Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party \"[[spoils system]]\" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which forcibly [[Trail of Tears|relocated]] most members of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the South to [[Indian Territory]]. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a \"most favored nation\" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and recognized the [[Republic of Texas]]. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president.\n\nIn his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]]. Though fearful of its effects on the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate, Jackson advocated the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]], which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson has been widely revered in the United States as an advocate for democracy and the common man. Many of his actions, such as those during the Bank War, proved divisive, garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country. His reputation has suffered since the 1970s, largely due to his role in Indian removal. Surveys of historians and scholars have [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] Jackson favorably among United States presidents.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the [[Waxhaws]] region of the Carolinas.

She then began to walk both boys back to their home in the Waxhaws, a distance of some 40 miles (64&nbsp;km). Both were in very poor health. Robert, who was far worse, rode on the only horse that they had, while Andrew walked behind them. In the final two hours of the journey, a torrential downpour began which worsened the effects of the smallpox.

The size and quality of the Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food, Jackson supplied them with guns, knives, and fishing equipment.

Jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough.<ref name=Hermitage_Slavery_2011/> At various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation.

Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=139\u2013143}}\n\nAfter the Sevier affair and the duel, Jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation.

He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of Brigadier General [[James Wilkinson]], whom he deeply disliked, in the plan.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=150\u2013151}} Jackson acted cautiously at first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President [[Thomas Jefferson]], vaguely warning them about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were sent home.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=151\u2013158}} Jackson traveled to [[Richmond, Virginia]], to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand, fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed [[James Monroe]] for president in [[United States presidential election, 1808|1808]] against [[James Madison]]. The latter was part of the Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=158}} Jackson lived relatively quietly at the Hermitage in the years after the Burr trial, eventually accumulating 640 acres of land.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=165}}\n\n==Military career==\n===War of 1812===\n\n====Creek campaign and treaty====\n{{Main|Creek War}}\n[[File:Andrew Jackson by Ralph E.

During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs [[William Weatherford|Red Eagle]] and [[Peter McQueen]], had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with [[Tecumseh]], a [[Shawnee]] chief who had launched [[Tecumseh's War]] against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British.

He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22\u201324, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the [[Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek]].

An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort.

The Spanish surrendered and the British fled. Weeks later, he learned that the British were planning an attack on [[New Orleans]], which sat on the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and held immense strategic and commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish, placed a force in [[Mobile, Alabama]] to guard against a possible invasion there, and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=241\u2013245}}\n\nThe Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, ''Jacksa Chula Harjo'' or \"Jackson, old and fierce.\"{{sfn|Jahoda|1975|p=6}}\n\n====Battle of New Orleans====\n{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|The ''Battle of New Orleans''.

That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=73\u201376}} On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster.{{sfn|Snelling|1831|pp=81\u201385}} For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured.{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=285}} After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \"Second American Revolution\" against the British.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=29\u201333}} By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the [[Thanks of Congress]] and awarded a [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref name=\"US Congress Bio\"/>\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (\"underwhelmed\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' that Jackson \"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\"{{sfn|Leeden|2001|pp=32\u201333}} Some have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure. However, the Spanish, who had sold the Louisiana Territory to France, disputed France's right to sell it to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. If the British defeated Jackson at New Orleans, they might have held on to the territory or returned it to Spain. Furthermore, Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent stipulated that the United States must return land taken from the Creeks to their original owners, essentially undoing the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Thanks to Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the American government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that Jackson had acquired.{{sfn|Baptist|2014|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n====Enforced martial law in New Orleans====\nJackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused to lift martial law in the city. In March 1815, after U.S. District Court Judge [[Dominic Augustin Hall|Dominic A.

The Seminole, in alliance with escaped slaves, frequently raided Georgia settlements before retreating back into Florida. These skirmishes continually escalated, and the conflict is now known as the [[First Seminole War]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=36\u201337}} In 1816, Jackson led a detachment into Florida which [[Battle of Negro Fort|destroyed]] the [[Fort Gadsden|Negro Fort]], a community of escaped slaves and their descendants.{{sfn|Brands|2005|pp=325\u2013327}} Jackson was ordered by President Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the Seminole and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves, after Spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to \"terminate the conflict.\"{{sfn|Remini|1977|p=118}} Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, \"Let it be signified to me through any channel&nbsp;... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ogg|1919|p=66}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson bust.jpg|thumb|Teracotta bust of General Jackson by [[William Rush]], 1819 |alt=Bust of Jackson in military uniform.

He crushed Seminole and Spanish resistance in the region and captured two British agents, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been working with the Seminole. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of the men, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had not [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] upon Spain. He was defended by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]]. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House [[Henry Clay]]. After the ratification of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1821, Jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial [[Governor of Florida]] before returning to Tennessee.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=37\u201340}}\n\n==Presidential aspirations==\n===Election of 1824===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1824}}\n\nIn the spring of 1822, Jackson suffered a physical breakdown. His body had two bullets lodged in it, and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning. He regularly coughed up blood, and his entire body shook. Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death. After several months of rest, he recovered.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=1\u20133}} During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs. He obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the [[Second Bank of the United States]], blaming it for causing the [[Panic of 1819]] by contracting credit.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=12\u201315}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson in 1824, painted by [[Thomas Sully]]|alt=A man with wavy gray hair in white shirt, black bowtie, and black coat.

Crawford]], who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford. Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. The Panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular. With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]]. During the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major issues of the day, most prominently the [[Tariff of 1824|tariff]], Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption. Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=41\u201345}}\n\nIn 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats.

In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for president and [[Albert Gallatin]] for vice president. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the \"voice of the people\" in the \"vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate.\"{{sfn|Rutland|1995|pp=48\u201349}} Gallatin criticized Jackson as \"an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office.\"{{sfn|Adams|1879|p=599}} After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" />\n\nIn the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]] under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election, saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded [[internal improvement]]s such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot. Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=45\u201348}} \"So you see,\" Jackson growled, \"the Judas of the West has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver.

It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator [[Martin Van Buren]], who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Adams's followers became known as the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=49\u201354}} In the large Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a favorite.{{sfn|Byrne|Coleman|King|2008|p=837}}\n\nThe campaign was heavily personal. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press. Jackson was labelled a [[slave trader]] who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Cheathem |title=Frontiersman or Southern Gentleman?

Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=104}} He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]].

Therefore, Adams chose not to attend the inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1977|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nOn March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html|title=Inaugurals of Presidents of the United States: Some Precedents and Notable Events|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701120453/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pinotable.html|archivedate=July 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In his inaugural speech, Jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency. He also promised to pursue \"reform\" by removing power from \"unfaithful or incompetent hands.\" At the conclusion of the ceremony, Jackson invited the public to the [[White House]], where his supporters held a raucous party. Thousands of spectators overwhelmed the White House staff, and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings. Jackson's populism earned him the nickname \"King Mob.\"{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n===Petticoat affair===\n{{Main|Petticoat affair}}\nJackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the \"Petticoat affair\" or \"Eaton affair.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=107}} Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's cabinet members and their wives, including Calhoun's wife [[Floride Calhoun]], concerning Secretary of War Eaton and his wife [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton|Peggy Eaton]]. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=115}} Controversy also ensued because Peggy had married soon after her previous husband's death, and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living.{{sfn|Marszalek|2000|p=84}} Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. Allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkable\u2014but Jackson refused to believe the rumors, telling his Cabinet that \"She is as chaste as a virgin!\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=115}} Jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, who in essence questioned and dishonored Jackson himself by, in attempting to drive the Eatons out, daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet. Jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife. These memories increased his dedication to defending Peggy Eaton.{{sfn|Bates|2015|p=315}}\n\nMeanwhile, the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women was at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian [[Daniel Walker Howe]] notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\nIn the spring of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except Barry. Van Buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would \"...kill [Van Buren], sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Van Buren continued to serve as an important adviser to Jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the 1832 election, making him Jackson's heir-apparent.<ref name=\"John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President (1825\u20131832)\" /> The Petticoat affair led to the development of the [[Kitchen Cabinet]]. The Kitchen Cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|pp=171\u2013175}}\n\n===Indian removal policy===\n{{Further|Indian removal|Indian Removal Act|Trail of Tears}}\n[[File:Trails of Tears en.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Jackson's Indian Removal Act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] from their traditional territories, including the [[Trail of Tears]].|alt=Map of the southern United States showing in dark green areas ceded by Indians]]\n\nThroughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with Native American tribes both in the [[Old Southwest|South]] and the [[Old Northwest|Northwest]].{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=109}} Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-[[European American|Anglo]] American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included the [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Creek]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Seminole]] and the [[Cherokee]]. The northwest tribes include the [[Chippewa]], [[Odawa|Ottawa]], and the [[Potawatomi]].{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=110}}\n\nRelations between Indians and Americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}} Previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to \"civilize\" the Indians,{{sfn|Rutland|1995|pp=199\u2013200}} but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention. There had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue, and out of this policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=108}}\n\nIn his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the [[Mississippi River]] be set aside for Indian tribes. On May 26, 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which Jackson signed into law two days later. The Act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=109}} The act specifically pertained to the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] in the [[Southern United States|South]], the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law, effectively relinquishing their sovereignty.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=269}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Jackson, by Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, c. 1788 - 1838.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Jackson by [[Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl|Earl]], 1830 |alt=White-haired man stands outdoors beside a tree with cane.]]\nJackson, Eaton, and General Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=271}} Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw.

So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress.\"<ref name=\"3rd Message\"/>\n\nAlthough he was unable to implement these goals, Jackson's time in office did see a variety of other reforms. He supported an act in July 1836 that enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband's pensions.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=193\u2013194}} In 1836, Jackson established the ten-hour day in national shipyards.{{sfn|Nevins|Commanger|Morris|1992|p=168}}\n\nJackson enforced the [[Tenure of Office Act (1820)|Tenure of Office Act]], signed by President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a [[Term limits in the United States|rotation in office]] was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=61}} Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was \"a leading principle in the republican creed.\"<ref name=\"firstaddress\"/> Jackson noted, \"In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=418}} Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|pp=61\u201362}} Jackson, nonetheless, used his presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster, Jackson stated, \"[i]f he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me.\"{{sfn|Sabato|O'Connor|2002|p=293}}\n\nJackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the [[spoils system]].{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=61}} The political realities of Washington sometimes forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=328\u2013334}} Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades) proved to be difficult.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=65}} Remini claims that because \"friendship, politics, and geography constituted the President's total criteria for appointments, most of his appointments were predictably substandard.\"{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=268}}\n\n===Nullification crisis===\n{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}\n\nIn 1828, Congress had approved the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\", which set the tariff at an historically high rate. Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they saw as favoring northern interests. The South now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally; and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton. The issue came to a head during Jackson's presidency, resulting in the [[Nullification Crisis]], in which South Carolina threatened disunion.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nThe [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state had the right to \"nullify\"\u2014declare void\u2014the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident came at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added \"Our federal Union: It must be preserved!\"&nbsp;\u2013 a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding \"The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!\"{{sfn|Ogg|1919|p=164}}\n\nIn May 1830, Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure then-General Jackson for his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War. Calhoun's and Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the ''United States Telegraph''. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.<ref name=\"John C.

After it took the side of Calhoun, Jackson needed a new organ for the administration.

It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary [[Louis McLane]], the bill lowered duties from 45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the President on July 14. The bill ultimately failed to satisfy extremists on either side.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=358\u2013360}} On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ordnull.asp |title=South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification, November 24, 1832 |publisher=The Avalon Project |access-date=August 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819073235/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ordnull.asp |archivedate=August 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In response, Jackson sent [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=405\u2013406}} On December 28, 1832, Calhoun resigned as vice president to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.<ref name=\"John C.

Hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the Senate, especially against fierce criticism from Senator [[Daniel Webster]] of Massachusetts.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=192}}\n\nIn December 1832, Jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the \"nullifiers,\" stating that he considered \"the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\" South Carolina, the President declared, stood on \"the brink of insurrection and treason,\" and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: \"The Constitution&nbsp;... forms a government not a league&nbsp;... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not a nation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December 10, 1832 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm |access-date=August 10, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824095525/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm |archivedate=August 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref> Jackson tended to personalize the controversy, frequently characterizing nullification as a conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nJackson asked Congress to pass a \"[[Force Bill]]\" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff. It was introduced by Senator [[Felix Grundy]] of Tennessee, and was quickly attacked by Calhoun as \"military despotism.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|pp=239\u2013240}} At the same time, Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]]. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [[Gulian C. Verplanck]] of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=38}} The Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=247}} The Force Bill passed the same day. Calhoun, Clay, and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition, with the only dissenting vote coming from [[John Tyler]] of Virginia.{{sfn|Niven|1988|p=197}} The new tariff was opposed by Webster, who argued that it essentially surrendered to South Carolina's demands.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=40}} Jackson, despite his anger over the scrapping of the Verplanck bill and the new alliance between Clay and Calhoun, saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis. He signed both bills on March 2, starting with the Force Bill.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=42}} The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=247}} On May 1, Jackson wrote, \"the tariff was only the pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object.

The French king [[Louis Philippe I]] and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In [[:s:Andrew Jackson's Sixth State of the Union Address|his December 1834 State of the Union address]], Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was \"wholly disappointed\" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=119}} Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until Jackson had apologized for his remarks.{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=284}} In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, reparations were paid.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nIn addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Siam]]. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent [[Republic of Texas]]. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. Jackson was hesitant in recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected president. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating [[Alc\u00e9e Louis la Branche]] as charg\u00e9 d'affaires on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\nJackson failed in his efforts to open trade with China and Japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=120}}\n\n===Bank veto and election of 1832===\n{{Main|Bank War|Banking in the Jacksonian Era|United States presidential election, 1832}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1832.svg|thumb|1832 election results|alt=A map of the 1832 presidential election.

The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Henry Clay, now a senator from [[Kentucky]], and [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] of Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=218}} The [[Anti-Masonic Party]] emerged by capitalizing on opposition to [[Freemasonry]], which existed primarily in New England, after the disappearance and possible murder of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]].{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=420}} The party, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] of Maryland and [[Amos Ellmaker]] of Pennsylvania. Clay was, like Jackson, a Mason, and so some anti-Jacksonians who would have supported the National Republican Party supported Wirt instead.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nIn 1816, the [[Second Bank of the United States]] was chartered by President [[James Madison]] to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=111}} Monroe had appointed [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] as the Bank's executive.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson believed that the Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made \"the rich richer and the potent more powerful.\"{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=53}} In his address to Congress in 1830, Jackson called for a substitute for the Bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land. Its only power would be to issue bills of exchange.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=302}} The address touched off fiery debate in the Senate. Thomas Hart Benton, now a strong supporter of the President despite the brawl years earlier, gave a speech strongly denouncing the Bank and calling for open debate on its recharter. Webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution. Shortly afterward, the ''Globe'' announced that Jackson would stand for reelection.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=303\u2013304}}\n\nDespite his misgivings about the Bank, he supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary [[Louis McLane]], who was secretly working with Biddle, to recharter a reformed version of the Bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation's debt. This would be done, in part, through the sale of government stock in the Bank. Over the objections of [[Attorney General]] [[Roger B. Taney]], an irreconcilable opponent of the Bank, he allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the Bank.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=337\u2013340}}\n\nClay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill. He and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=201}} Biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. On January 6, 1832 Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter without any of the proposed reforms.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=343}} The submission came four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}} Jackson determined to veto it. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson declared, \"The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.\"{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=363\u2013366}} Jackson officially vetoed the bill on July 10. The veto message was crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew and advisor [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. It attacked the Bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy.{{sfn|Remini|1981|pp=366\u2013369}} The veto was considered \"one of the strongest and most controversial\" presidential statements{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=369}} and \"a brilliant political manifesto.\"{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=369\u2013370}} The [[National Republican Party]] immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue.{{sfn|Latner|2002|pp=112\u2013113}} Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as \"the very slang of the leveller and demagogue,\" claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=112}}\n\nAt Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=376}} On July 21, Clay said privately, \"The campaign is over, and I think we have won the victory.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=215}} Jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match to Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=113}} Jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. Jackson won the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party eventually declined.{{sfn|Meacham|2008|p=220}} Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.{{sfn|Ellis|1974|p=63}}\n\n===Removal of deposits and censure===\nIn 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.{{sfn|Bogart|1907|pp=219\u2013221}} Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. He removed McLane from the Treasury Department, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing [[Edward Livingston]]. He replaced McLane with [[William J. Duane]].{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=57\u201358; 171}} In September, he fired Duane for refusing to remove the deposits. Signalling his intent to continue battling the Bank, he replaced Duane with Taney.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|p=395}} Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed.{{sfn|Bogart|1907|pp=219\u2013221}} They were placed in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration's policies, known to critics as [[pet banks]].{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=500}} Biddle responded by stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic. The moves were intended to force Jackson into a compromise. \"Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress,\" he wrote. At first, Biddle's strategy was successful, putting enormous pressure on Jackson.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1953|p=103}} But Jackson handled the situation well. When people came to him complaining, he referred them to Biddle, saying that he was the man who had \"all the money.\"{{sfn|Parton|1860b|pp=549-550}} Jackson's approach worked.

When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adams' expedition plans. Eventually, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to Jefferson and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], Jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic [[United States Exploring Expedition]]. Jackson put Secretary of the Navy [[Mahlon Dickerson]] in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired.

Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.{{sfn|Olson|2002|p=190}} The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841, when the economy began to rebound.<ref name=\"npr\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm |title=Historical Debt Outstanding \u2013 Annual 1791\u20131849 |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |work=Public Debt Reports |publisher=Treasury Direct |archivedate=October 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030060937/https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm }}</ref>\n\n===Administration and cabinet===\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=left\n|Name=Jackson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.potus.com/ajackson.html |title=Andrew Jackson |last=Summers |first=Robert S. |website=POTUS: Presidents of the United States |access-date=May 31, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606030310/http://potus.com/ajackson.html |archivedate=June 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|President=Andrew Jackson\n|President start=1829\n|President end=1837\n|Vice President=[[John C.

He immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=121}} He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, \"I will die with the Union.\"{{sfn|Curtis|1976|p=145}} Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the \"perfidy and treachery\" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the Specie Circular as president.{{sfn|Latner|2002|p=121}}\n\nAs a solution to the panic, he supported an [[Independent Treasury]] system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of [[Hard money (policy)|gold or silver]] and would be restricted from printing [[Banknote|paper money]] so as to prevent further [[inflation]].{{sfn|Lansford|Woods|2008|p=1046}} A coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero [[William Henry Harrison]] and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]]. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats when Jackson ran. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=462\u2013470}} He favored the nomination of Polk for vice president at the [[1840 Democratic National Convention]] over controversial incumbent [[Richard Mentor Johnson]].

A treaty of annexation was signed by Tyler on April 12, 1844, and submitted to the Senate. When a letter from Secretary of State Calhoun to British Ambassador [[Richard Pakenham]] linking annexation to slavery was made public, anti-annexation sentiment exploded in the North and the bill failed to be ratified. Van Buren decided to write the \"Hamlet letter,\" opposing annexation. This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the South.{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=496\u2013500}} The Whig nominee, Henry Clay, also opposed annexation, and Jackson recognized the need for the Democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the South.

Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough.

Historian [[Charles Grier Sellers]] says, \"Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage.\" There has never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for \"his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers.\"{{sfn|Sellers|1958|p=615}} He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies. He has been lauded as the champion of the common man, while criticized for his treatment of Indians and for other matters.{{sfn|Sellers|1958|pp=615\u2013634}} [[James Parton]] was the first man after Jackson's death to write a full biography of him. Trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|Andrew Jackson, I am given to understand, was a patriot and a traitor. He was one of the greatest generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. A brilliant writer, elegant, eloquent, without being able to compose a correct sentence or spell words of four syllables. The first of statesmen, he never devised, he never framed, a measure. He was the most candid of men, and was capable of the most profound dissimulation. A most law-defying law-obeying citizen. A stickler for discipline, he never hesitated to disobey his superior. A democratic autocrat. An urbane savage. An atrocious saint.{{sfn|Parton|1860a|p=vii}}}}\n\nJackson was criticized by his contemporary [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:\n\n{{quote|Far from wishing to extend the Federal power, the President belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the Union; far from standing forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of the state jealousies; and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government. It is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity. General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its propensities, and its demands\u2014say, rather, anticipates and forestalls them. ...\n\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority; but when he feels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy. Supported by a power that his predecessors never had, he tramples on his personal enemies, whenever they cross his path, with a facility without example; he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt. He even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult; he puts his veto on the laws of Congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly.|author=[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]|source=[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/1_ch18.htm Democracy in America, 1835, Volume I, Chapter XVIII]}}\n\nIn the 20th century, Jackson was written about by many admirers.

He also claims that the Indian controversy overshadowed Jackson's other achievements. Noting shifting attitudes on different national issues, Brands notes that he was often hailed during his lifetime as the \"second George Washington,\" because, while Washington had fought for independence, Jackson confirmed it at New Orleans and made the United States a great world power. Over time, while the Revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience, memory of the War of 1812, including the Battle of New Orleans, has sharply declined.

Johnson assumed the presidency as he was [[Vice President of the United States]] at the time of the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. A [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] who ran with Lincoln on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] ticket, Johnson came to office as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the [[Secession in the United States|seceded states]] to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the [[Freedmen#United States|former slaves]], and he came into conflict with the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]]-dominated Congress, culminating in [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|his impeachment]] by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.\n\nJohnson was born in poverty in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and never attended school. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several frontier towns before settling in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. He served as [[alderman]] and mayor there before being elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] in 1835. After brief service in the [[Tennessee Senate]], Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became [[Governor of Tennessee]] for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the [[Homestead Bill]], which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. As [[Southern United States|Southern]] slave states, including Tennessee, seceded to form the [[Confederate States of America]], Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a [[War Democrat]] and [[Southern Unionist]], was a logical choice as [[running mate]] for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, he gave a rambling speech, after which he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.\n\nJohnson implemented his own form of [[Presidential Reconstruction]]&nbsp;\u2013 a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency.<ref>Johnson saw 15 of his vetoes overridden by Congress, [[List of United States presidential vetoes|more than any other President, before or since]].</ref> Johnson opposed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=231}} As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.\n\nReturning to Tennessee after his presidency, Johnson sought political vindication, and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict [[constitutionalism]],{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=237}} his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for [[African Americans]] is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|one of the worst presidents in American history]].\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\n=== Childhood ===\n[[File:Andrew Johnsons First Home 2006.jpg|thumb|Johnson's childhood home, located at the [[Mordecai House|Mordecai Historic Park]] in Raleigh, North Carolina]]\n\nAndrew Johnson was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], on December 29, 1808, to [[Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)|Jacob Johnson]] (1778\u20131812) and Mary (\"Polly\") McDonough (1783\u20131856), a laundress.

Johnson's birth in a two-room shack was a political asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins.{{sfnm|Gordon-Reed|1pp=17\u201318|Castel|2002|2p=225}} Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. Both Jacob and Mary were illiterate, and had worked as tavern servants, while Johnson never attended school.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=225}} Johnson grew up in poverty.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=225}} Jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=20}} Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=18\u201322}}\n\nJohnson's mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew also became an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson lived with his mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=22\u201323}} His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, [[Annette Gordon-Reed]], suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=26}}\n\nJohnson was not happy at James Selby's, and after about five years, both he and his brother ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: \"Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two apprentice boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson&nbsp;... [payment] to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=27}} The brothers went to [[Carthage, North Carolina]], where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to [[Laurens, South Carolina]]. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal.  He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=23\u201326}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=27\u201329}}\n\n=== Move to Tennessee ===\nJohnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot. After a brief period in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], he moved to [[Mooresville, Alabama]].{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=23\u201326}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=29\u201330}} He then worked as a tailor in [[Columbia, Tennessee]], but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nIn Greeneville, Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home. In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old [[Eliza McCardle Johnson|Eliza McCardle]], the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of [[Thomas Lincoln]], whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: [[Martha Johnson Patterson|Martha]] (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from [[Tuberculosis]], Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=27\u201329}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=31\u201332}} Shy and retiring by nature, Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson's political rise. She was not often seen during her husband's presidency; their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=32}}\n\nJohnson's tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage, enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=32\u201333}} He later boasted of his talents as a tailor, \"my work never ripped or gave way.\"{{sfn|Castel|p=3}} He was a voracious reader. Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue, and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views. He also took part in debates at [[Greeneville College]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=31}}\n\n== Political rise ==\n\n=== Tennessee politician ===\nJohnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=35}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=33\u201336}} Following the 1831 [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner slave rebellion]], a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to [[disfranchisement|disenfranchise]] free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=33, 36}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n[[File:Mrs-E-Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eliza McCardle Johnson]]\nIn 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the \"floater\" seat which [[Greene County, Tennessee|Greene County]] shared with neighboring [[Washington County, Tennessee|Washington County]] in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]]. According to his biographer, [[Hans L. Trefousse]], Johnson \"demolished\" the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=36}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=37}} Soon after taking his seat, Johnson purchased his first slave, Dolly, aged 14. Dolly had three children over the years. Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly, and the fact that Dolly was dark-skinned, and her offspring much lighter, led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=38\u201339}} During his Greeneville days, Johnson joined the [[Tennessee Army National Guard|Tennessee Militia]] as a member of the 90th Regiment. He attained the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], though while an enrolled member, Johnson was fined for an unknown offense.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=14, 25}} Afterwards, he was often addressed or referred to by his rank.\n\nIn his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or the newly formed [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], though he revered President [[Andrew Jackson]], a Democrat and fellow Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After [[Brookins Campbell]] and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=38\u201342}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=39\u201340}} Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=42}}\n\nIn 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President [[Martin Van Buren]] was defeated by former Ohio senator [[William Henry Harrison]], Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=43}} He was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate]] in 1841, where he served a two-year term.<ref name=\"CongBio\">{{CongBio|J000116|inline=1}}</ref> He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics.

He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough]] lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892.{{sfn|Schroeder-Lein|Zuczuk|2001|p=55}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=51\u201353}} In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=53}} With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=56}} Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, [[James K. Polk]], [[United States presidential election, 1844|was elected president]] in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=44}}\n\nJohnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=43\u201344}} He won a second term in 1845 against [[William Gannaway Brownlow|Wiliam G. Brownlow]], presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]], seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant {{convert|160|acre}} to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=61\u201363}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=45\u201346}} This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=61\u201363}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=47\u201349}}\n\nIn the [[United States presidential election, 1848|presidential election of 1848]], the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the [[Free Soil Party]], with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]]. With the party split, Whig nominee General [[Zachary Taylor]] was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=69\u201371}} Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that\n\n{{quote|Among the visitors I observed in the crowd today was Hon.

He defeated his opponent, [[Nathaniel G. Taylor]], in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat [[Howell Cobb]] was elected.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=74\u201375}}\n\nOnce the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's [[Henry Clay]] introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the [[Compromise of 1850]], to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=75\u201376}} He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=78}}\n\nA group of Democrats nominated [[Landon Carter Haynes]] to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=78}} Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator [[Franklin Pierce]], Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=81}} In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=49}} The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of [[Gustavus Adolphus Henry, Sr.|Gustavus Henry]], redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party.

The Democratic convention unanimously named him, though some party members were not happy at his selection. The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections, and still controlled the legislature.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=84\u201385}} That party nominated Henry, making the \"Henry-mandering\" of the First District an immediate issue.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=84\u201385}} The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry's family.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=51}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=87\u201388}} Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig [[Nathaniel Green Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] for his old seat in Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=88}}{{sfn|Schroeder-Lein|Zuczuk|2001|p=119}}\n\nTennessee's governor had little power: Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, the office was a \"[[bully pulpit]]\" that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=52\u201353}} He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], a Whig, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolition of the Bank of Tennessee, and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county\u2014a mixture of the two was passed.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=92}} Reforms carried out during Johnson's time as governor included the foundation of the State's public library (making books available to all) and its first public school system, and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smalley |first=Ruth |date=2003 |title=An Interview with Andrew Johnson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&pg=PA35 |location=Johnson City, TN |publisher=Overmountain Press |page=35 |isbn=978-1-57072-257-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223114014/https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&pg=PA35 |archivedate=February 23, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally, it remained strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. [[Meredith P. Gentry]] received the Whig nomination. A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] positions of the [[Know Nothing Party]]. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=55\u201356}} Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=95\u201397}}\n\nWhen the presidential election of 1856 approached, Johnson hoped to be nominated; some Tennessee county conventions designated him a \"[[favorite son]]\". His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president. He was never a major contender; the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator [[James Buchanan]]. Though he was not impressed by either, Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate, [[John C. Breckinridge]], who were elected.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nJohnson decided not to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards election to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him in the years to come.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== United States Senator ===\n\n==== Homestead Bill advocate ====\n[[File:Andrew Johnson by Vannerson, 1859.jpg|thumb|Senator Johnson, 1859]]\n\nThe victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor [[William B. Campbell]] wrote to his uncle, \"The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans{{efn|The Know Nothings, who were then formally known as the American Party.}} and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=105\u2013106}} The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=106}} Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond ''Whig'' newspaper referring to him as \"the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nJohnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self-employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the \"plebeians\"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, \"Johnson was always the same to everyone&nbsp;... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen.\"{{sfn|Castel|p=4}} Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure,{{sfn|Trefousse|p=111}} and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts.{{sfn|Castel|p=5}} One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, \"you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could<!-- Capitalization as in original --> have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but ''the people would send you''.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nThe new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, [[James C. Jones]], had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the [[Homestead Bill]] in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30\u201322.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=110\u2013112}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=58\u201359}} In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=116, 121}} Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.\n\nHe argued against funding to build infrastructure in Washington, D.C., stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down [[Utah War|the revolt]] by the Mormons in [[Utah Territory]], arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=114}}\n\n==== Secession crisis ====\n[[File:AndrewJohnson1860.png|thumb|Johnson in 1860]]\n\nIn October 1859, abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and sympathizers [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raided the federal arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that \"all men are created equal\" from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] did not apply to African Americans, since the [[Constitution of Illinois]] contained that phrase\u2014and that document barred voting by African Americans.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=119}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=59}} Johnson, by this time, was a wealthy man who owned a few household slaves,{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=226}} 14 slaves, according to the 1860 Federal Census.<ref>1860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedule for Nashville's 7th ward, Davidson County, Tennessee</ref>\n\nJohnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative [[Abraham Lincoln]]. [[United States presidential election, 1860|The election of Lincoln]], known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=123\u2013127}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=60\u201363}}\n\nJohnson took to the Senate floor after the election, giving a speech well received in the North, \"I will not give up this government&nbsp;... No;<!-- punct as in original --> I intend to stand by it&nbsp;... and I invite every man who is a patriot to&nbsp;... rally around the altar of our common country&nbsp;... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|p=131}}{{sfn|Johnson|pp=172\u2013173}} As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator [[Jefferson Davis]] that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=134}} Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon be [[President of the Confederate States of America|the president]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=64}}\n\nJohnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession. His successor as governor, [[Isham G. Harris]], and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's [[East Tennessee|eastern region of Tennessee]] was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the [[Cumberland Gap]], where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.{{sfn|Castel|p=8}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=138\u2013143}}\n\nAs the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent [[Southern Unionist]], Johnson had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=143}} With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=140\u2013148}}\n\n=== Military Governor of Tennessee ===\n{{anchor|General}}<!-- This section is linked to from [[Abraham Lincoln]] -->\nJohnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=69\u201370}} The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=153}} In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=151}} Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators, the [[Homestead Bill]] was finally enacted. Along with legislation for [[land-grant college]]s and for the [[transcontinental railroad]], the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.{{sfn|Foner|pp=21, 661}}\n\nAs military governor, Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him.{{sfn|Castel|p=9}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=71\u201372}} Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as well as he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Relief from Union regulars did not come until [[William S. Rosecrans]] defeated the Confederates at [[Battle of Murfreesboro|Murfreesboro]] in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=162}}\n\nWhen Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January 1863, declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate-held areas, he exempted Tennessee at Johnson's request. The proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war, as not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end. He wrote, \"If the institution of slavery&nbsp;... seeks to overthrow it [the Government], then the Government has a clear right to destroy it.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=72}} He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army, feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=73}} Nevertheless, he succeeded in recruiting 20,000 black soldiers to serve the Union.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=168\u2013170}}\n\n== Vice President (1865) ==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1864}}\n[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|Poster for the Lincoln and Johnson ticket by [[Currier and Ives]]]]\n\nIn 1860, Lincoln's running mate had been Maine Senator [[Hannibal Hamlin]]. Vice President Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and was willing to run again. Nevertheless, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's re-election bid in 1864.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=177}}\n\nLincoln considered several [[War Democrat]]s for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the President dispatched General [[Daniel Sickles]] to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Although Sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor, Johnson biographer Hans L. Trefousse believes Sickles's trip was connected to Johnson's subsequent nomination for vice president.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=177}} According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee.{{sfn|Castel|p=9}} Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, \"having Johnson, the ''southern'' War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=76}} Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of his fellow New Yorker, former senator [[Daniel S. Dickinson]], a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=178}}\n\nTo sound a theme of unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]], rather than the Republicans.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=76}} At [[1864 National Union National Convention|the party's convention]] in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, \"Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=178\u2013180}} When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|left|1865 cartoon showing Lincoln and Johnson using their talents as rail-splitter and tailor to repair the Union]]\n\nAlthough it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, [[George McClellan]], hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=181\u2013185}}\n\nNow Vice President-elect, Johnson was anxious to complete the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=183\u2013187}}\n\nJohnson traveled to Washington to be sworn in, although according to Gordon-Reed, \"in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=82}} He may have been ill; Castel cited typhoid fever,{{sfn|Castel|p=9}} though Gordon-Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=82}} On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating \"I need all the strength for the occasion I can have.\" In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president.{{sfn|Castel|pp=9\u201310}} Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, then went to his own swearing-in outside the Capitol, and delivered his acclaimed [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|Second Inaugural Address]].{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=85}}\n\nIn the weeks after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend, [[Francis Preston Blair]]. When he did return to Washington, it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to re-establish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he remained after word came that General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] had captured the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], presaging the end of the war.{{sfn|Castel|p=10}} Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behavior, that \"I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but you need not be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|p=191}}\n\n== Presidency (1865\u20131869) ==\n{{Main|Presidency of Andrew Johnson}}\n\n=== Accession ===\n{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:Johnson inauguration.jpg|thumb|Contemporary woodcut of Johnson being sworn in by Chief Justice Chase as Cabinet members look on, April 15, 1865]]\n\nOn the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration. Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to \"induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors\"; Gordon-Reed agrees.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=87}}{{sfn|Trefousse|p=192}}\n\nThat night, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], got drunk instead of killing the vice president. [[Leonard J. Farwell]], a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at [[Ford's Theatre]]. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, \"They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=193\u2013194}} Lincoln died at 7:22&nbsp;am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11&nbsp;am with Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as \"solemn and dignified\".{{sfn|Trefousse|p=194}} Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=90}} At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nThe events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, \"Don't wish to disturb you.  Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=90\u201392}}\n\nJohnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to [[Springfield, Illinois]], for interment.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=93}} Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|100000|1865}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of [[Mary Surratt]] for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=93\u201395}}\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n{{Main|Reconstruction Era}}\n\n==== Background ====\nUpon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a [[ten percent plan]] that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill|its own plan]], requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln [[pocket veto]]ed it.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=26}}\n\nJohnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved \"plebeians\". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868,  a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti-Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.{{sfn|Castel|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nThe Republicans had formed a number of factions. The [[Radical Republican]]s sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.{{sfn|Castel|pp=18\u201321}}\n\n==== Presidential Reconstruction ====\nJohnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=28}} Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=215\u2013216, 234\u2013235}}\n\nJohnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor [[Francis Pierpont]]. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding [[black suffrage]] or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\nAs Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important\u2014after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president [[Alexander Stephens]]. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory [[State of the Union|annual message]] to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.{{sfn|Castel|pp=50\u201359}}\n\nNortherners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw. They saw the Black Codes placing African Americans in a position barely above slavery. Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=35}}{{sfn|Castel|pp=58\u201359}} In addition, according to [[David O. Stewart]] in his book on Johnson's impeachment, \"the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson\".{{sfn|Stewart|p=26}}\n\n==== Break with the Republicans: 1866 ====\nCongress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=36}} According to Trefousse, \"If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress\".{{sfn|Trefousse|p=240}} The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans \u2013 both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.{{sfn|Castel|pp=62\u201368}}\n\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]] cartoon of Johnson disposing of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] as African Americans go flying]]\n\nIllinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]], leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day.{{sfn|Castel|pp=62\u201368}} Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.{{sfn|Foner|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\nOn February 22, 1866, [[Washington's Birthday]], Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the [[White House]] and called for an address in honor of [[George Washington|the first president]]. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of \"men&nbsp;... still opposed to the Union\" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=51\u201352}}{{sfn|Foner|p=249}} When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], and abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]], and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nAlthough strongly urged by Moderates to sign the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Bill]], Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|pp=250\u2013251}}{{sfn|Castel|p=70}} Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history.{{sfn|Castel|p=71}} The veto of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian [[Eric Foner]] in his volume on Reconstruction views it as \"the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career\". According to Stewart, the veto was \"for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency\".{{sfn|Stewart|p=53}}\n\nCongress also proposed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed\u2014by Congress, not the president.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=252}} Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=253\u2013254}} When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.{{sfn|Castel|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nEfforts to compromise failed,{{sfn|Stewart|pp=57\u201358}} and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term, in 1868.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=60\u201362}} The battleground was the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|election of 1866]]; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the \"[[Swing Around the Circle]]\". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=271}} Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.{{sfn|Castel|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n==== Radical Reconstruction ====\nEven with the Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson considered himself in a strong position. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] had been ratified by none of the Southern or [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for [[Colorado Territory]] was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.{{sfn|Castel|pp=107\u2013109}}\n\nIn January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under [[martial law]]. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the [[Reconstruction Acts|First Reconstruction Act]] as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.{{sfn|Castel|pp=107\u2013109}}\n\n=== Impeachment ===\n{{Main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}\n[[File:The situation.jpg|thumb|\"The Situation\", a ''Harper's Weekly'' editorial cartoon, shows Secretary of War Stanton aiming a cannon labeled \"Congress\" to defeat Johnson. The rammer is \"Tenure of Office Bill\" and cannonballs on the floor are \"Justice\".]]\n\nSecretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=62\u201364}} Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=64\u201366}}\n\nThe new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.{{sfn|Castel|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nLater in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General [[Henry Stanbery]] issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General [[Philip Sheridan]], who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. Johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session.{{sfn|Castel|pp=128\u2013135}} Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.{{sfn|Castel|pp=135\u2013137}}\n\nGrant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, [[Daniel Sickles]], who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the [[Ohio General Assembly]], allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator [[Benjamin Wade]]. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=95\u201397}}\n\nThe adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections.{{sfn|Castel|p=146}} Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\nJohnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed [[Lorenzo Thomas]] to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=313\u2013316}}\n\n[[File:Andew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]], by [[Theodore R. Davis]], published in ''Harper's Weekly'']]\n\nOn March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen [[George S. Boutwell]], Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and [[William M. Evarts]], [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=316, 336}}\n\nThe defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=319}} Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.{{sfn|Castel|p=81}}\n\nJohnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator [[James W. Grimes]] that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected [[John Schofield]] as War Secretary. {{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=138\u2013139}} Kansas Senator [[Edmund G. Ross]] received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\nOne reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'']] of the Senate. Wade, a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=139}}{{sfn|Stewart|p=307}} Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=330}}\n\nWith the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted \"guilty\" and 19 \"not guilty\", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans\u2014Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, [[William Pitt Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[John B. Henderson]], and [[Peter G. Van Winkle]]\u2014voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the [[1868 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35\u201319 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=323\u2013328}}{{sfn|Stewart|pp=340\u2013341}} Stanton \"relinquished\" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield.{{sfn|Castel|p=195}} When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=336}}\n\nAllegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York\u2013based \"Astor House Group\", supposedly led by [[political boss]] and editor [[Thurlow Weed]]. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building <!-- a committee room and then an artist's studio --> when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=240\u2013247, 284\u2013292}}\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nSoon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, [[French intervention in Mexico|the French had intervened in Mexico]], sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.{{sfn|Castel|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nSeward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its [[Russian America|North American colony]] (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron [[Eduard de Stoeckl]], to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections.{{sfn|Castel|p=120}} This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|7200000|1867}}}} in present-day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37\u20132.{{sfn|Castel|pp=120\u2013122}} Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited [[Wake Island]] in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. [[William McKinley#Peace and territorial gain|in 1898]]. He came close with the [[Danish West Indies]] as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.<ref>{{cite book|author=David M.

Negotiated by the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|United States Minister to Britain]], former Maryland senator [[Reverdy Johnson]], in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term.

He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative [[George H. Pendleton]], who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor [[Horatio Seymour]] was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=337\u2013339}}\n\n[[File:Andrew Johnson, Farewell to all my greatness cph.3a03724.jpg|thumb|left|\"Farewell to all my greatness\": ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon mocking Johnson on leaving office]]\n\nThe conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=340\u2013343}}\n\nSeymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Grant, who did not allow his to go.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=345\u2013347}}\n\nOn Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]], controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned in [[Fort Jefferson, Florida#Active use: 1860s\u20131930s|Fort Jefferson]] on Florida's [[Dry Tortugas]].{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=345\u2013347}}\n\nOn March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.{{sfn|Castel|pp=211\u2013212}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=350\u2013351}}\n\n== Post-presidency and return to Senate ==\n[[File:Andrew Johnson, 1875.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Senator Andrew Johnson in 1875 (age 66)]]\n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=348, 353\u2013354}}\n\nSome expected Johnson to run for Governor of Tennessee or for the Senate again, while others that he would become a railroad executive.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=349}} Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=142}} Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] kept down the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected [[Henry Cooper (U.S. Senator)|Henry Cooper]] over Johnson, 54\u201351.{{sfn|Castel|pp=214\u2013215}} In 1872, there was a special election for an [[Tennessee's at-large congressional district#1873 \u2013 1875: One at-large seat, among nine other districts|at-large congressional seat for Tennessee]]; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general [[Benjamin F. Cheatham]], decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, [[Horace Maynard]].{{sfn|Castel|p=215}}\n\nIn 1873, Johnson contracted [[cholera]] during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=364\u2013366}} He began looking towards the next Senate election, to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers' [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange movement]]; with his [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian leanings]], he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing;{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=334, 370\u2013371}}{{sfn|Castel|p=216}} remarked Johnson, \"Thank God for the vindication.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=142}}\n\nJohnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the ''St. Louis Republican'' calling it, \"the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show\".{{sfn|Castel|p=216}} At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president, Hamlin, by that office's current incumbent, [[Henry Wilson]], who as senator had voted for his ousting. Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's [[John Sherman]] (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, \"How far off is military despotism?\" and concluded his speech, \"may God bless this people and God save the Constitution.\"{{sfn|Castel|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\n=== Death ===\n\nJohnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near [[Elizabethton, Tennessee|Elizabethton]], where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the \"painful duty\" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=375\u2013377}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=143}} He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the [[Andrew Johnson National Cemetery]] in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=377}}\n\n== Historical reputation and legacy ==\nAccording to Castel, \"historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]\".{{sfn|Castel|p=vii}} Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator [[James G. Blaine]], depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress.{{sfn|Castel|p=218}} According to historian [[Howard K. Beale]] in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, \"Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian] [[Hilary Herbert]] and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North.\"{{sfn|Beale|p=807}}\n\nThe turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian [[James Ford Rhodes]], who wrote of the former president:{{sfn|Castel|p=218}}\n\n{{quote|Johnson acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals&nbsp;... His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy&nbsp;... His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.{{sfn|Rhodes|p=589}}}}\n\nRhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South.{{sfn|Beale|p=807}} Other early 20th-century historians, such as [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John Burgess]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] (who later became president himself) and [[William Dunning]], all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith.{{sfn|Castel|pp=218\u2013219}} Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson \"depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain\".{{sfn|Tolson}}\n\n[[File:Andrew-johnson-grave-01.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of Andrew Johnson, Greeneville, Tennessee]]\nEven as Rhodes and his school wrote, [[Dunning School|another group of historians]] was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, [[Gideon Welles]], first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's ''The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson'' (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 ''History of the Reconstruction Period'', the author accused Rhodes of being \"quite unfair to Johnson\", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.{{sfn|Castel|p=220}}\n\nCastel writes:\n\n{{quote|at the end of the 1920s, an historiographical revolution took place. In the span of three years five widely read books appeared, all highly pro-Johnson....They differed in general approach and specific interpretations, but they all glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies. According to these writers, Johnson was a humane, enlightened, and liberal statesman who waged a courageous battle for the Constitution and democracy against scheming and unscrupulous Radicals, who were motivated by a vindictive hatred of the South, partisanship, and a desire to establish the supremacy of Northern \"big business.\" In short, rather than a boor, Johnson was a martyr; instead of a villain, a hero.{{sfn|Castel|pp=220\u201321}}}}\n\nBeale wondered in 1940, \"is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?\"{{sfn|Beale|p=808}} Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942, [[Van Heflin]] portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film ''[[Tennessee Johnson]]''. In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger]] deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives.{{sfn|Castel|p=221}} Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, \"the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote\".{{sfn|Foner column}}\n\nEarlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drove events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing [[civil rights movement]] as a second Reconstruction; [[Neoabolitionism|some writers stated]] they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as [[Fawn Brodie]], the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton.{{sfn|Castel|pp=223\u2013225}} Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.{{sfn|Tolson}}{{sfn|Foner column}}\n\nIn the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history.{{sfn|Tolson}} According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] the worst president, \"Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment&nbsp;... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy&nbsp;... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance.\"{{sfn|Lafantasie}} Tolson suggests that \"Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans\".{{sfn|Tolson}} Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, \"there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice.\"{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=56}}\n\nTrefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be \"the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come.\"{{sfn|Trefousse|p=352}} Gordon-Reed states of Johnson:\n\n{{quote|We know the results of Johnson's failures\u2014that his preternatural stubbornness, his mean and crude racism, his primitive and instrumental understanding of the Constitution stunted his capacity for enlightened and forward-thinking leadership when those qualities were so desperately needed. At the same time, Johnson's story has a miraculous quality to it: the poor boy who systematically rose to the heights, fell from grace, and then fought his way back to a position of honor in the country. For good or ill, 'only in America,' as they say, could Johnson's story unfold in the way that it did.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=144}}<!-- Note that the sentence does continue, it is clipped for effect -->}}\n\n== Notes ==\n'''Explanatory notes'''\n\n{{notes\n| notes =\n}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{for|further books and other material|Bibliography of Andrew Johnson}}\n* {{cite journal  | doi =   | last = Beale  | first = Howard K.  | authorlink = Howard K.

While there she met and married Isaakiy Semyonovich Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] of [[Cossacks|Cossack]] origin and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of ''August 1914'', and in the later ''[[The Red Wheel|Red Wheel]]'' novels.<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Taisiya became pregnant with Aleksandr.  On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident.  Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and his aunt in lowly circumstances.  His earliest years coincided with the [[Russian Civil War]]. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a [[kolkhoz|collective farm]]. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret.

During Khrushchev's tenure, ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' was studied in schools in the Soviet Union, as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his short story \"[[Matryona's Place|Matryona's Home]]\", published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.\n\n''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West.  It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West\u2014not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for \"libelous speech\" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Later years in the Soviet Union ===\n{{quote box | width = 22em | align = right\n| quote = Every time when we speak about Solzhenitsyn as the enemy of the Soviet regime, this just happens to coincide with some important [international] events and we postpone the decision.\n| source = [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]], a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] member.}}\nSolzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel ''Cancer Ward'' legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.<ref>{{Citation | title = [[The Oak and the Calf]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter Krushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well-known of all his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''.  The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an \"officially acclaimed\" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nAfter the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965\u201367, the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in [[Estonia]]. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] Prison cell.

In 1970, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow.  The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.\n\n''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed from 1958 to 1967.  It was a three-volume, seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system (Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at one time). The book was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 256<ref>{{Citation | title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Ekaterinburg: U-Faktoriia}}</ref> former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the Russian penal system.  It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Vladimir Lenin]] having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, [[Kengir uprising|prisoner uprisings and revolts]], and the practice of [[Exile|internal exile]]. ''The Gulag Archipelago'' has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages.\n\nAccording to fellow gulag historian [[Anne Applebaum]], ''The Gulag Archipelago'''s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made ''The Gulag Archipelago'' one of the most influential books of the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | first = Anne | last = Applebaum | year = 2007 | contribution = Foreword | publisher = Harper | series = Perennial Modern Classics | title = The Gulag Archipelago}}</ref>\n\nEven though ''The Gulag Archipelago'' was not published in the Soviet Union, it was extensively criticized by the Party-controlled Soviet press. An editorial in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting \"Hitlerites\" and making \"excuses for the crimes of the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia|Vlasovites]] and [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]] gangs.\" According to the editorial, Solzhenitsyn was \"choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up, for the socialist system, and for Soviet people.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Current Digest of the Soviet Press | volume = 26 | number = 2 | year = 1974 | page = 2}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, he was sheltered by the cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=S.|date=2010-02-01|title=Rostropovich's Recollections|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ml/gcp066|journal=Music and Letters|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=83\u201390|doi=10.1093/ml/gcp066|issn=0027-4224}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1971, the KGB allegedly made an attempt to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent (most likely [[ricin]]) with an experimental gel-based delivery method.

In a November 13, 1985, review of Solzhenitsyn's novel ''August 1914'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[American Jews|Jewish American]] historian [[Richard Pipes]] commented: \"Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism.

He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to [[Russian nationalism#Extremist nationalism|extreme nationalism]]), urged local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the \"[[near abroad]]\" of the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the \"conflation of 'Soviet' and 'Russian', against which I spoke so often in the 1970s, has not passed away in the West, in the ex-socialist countries, or in the former Soviet republics. The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target. They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist.

This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West.\nDelivering the commencement address at [[Harvard University]] in 1978, he called the United States spiritually weak and mired in vulgar [[materialism]]. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a \"decline in courage\" and a \"lack of manliness.\" Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its \"hasty\" capitulation in the [[Vietnam War]]. He criticized the country's music as intolerable and attacked its [[freedom of the press|unfettered press]], accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model.  While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: \"A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities.\" Solzhenitsyn also argued that the West erred in \"denying [Russian culture's] autonomous character and therefore never understood it\".<ref name=harvard />\n\nIn 2006, Solzhenitsyn accused [[NATO]] of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visual because of its \"ideological support for the '[[colour revolutions]]' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia\".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4953690.stm | title = Solzhenitsyn warns of Nato plot | newspaper = [[BBC News]] | date = 28 April 2006}}</ref> In a 2006 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' he stated \"This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border.

During his speech, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's [[Bolshevik]]s with the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin Party]] during the [[French Revolution]]. He also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism. However, he commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the [[Thermidorian reaction|toppling of the Jacobins]] and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] of the 1950s.<ref>''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings 1947\u20132005'', (2008), [[ISI Books]]. pp. 602\u201305.</ref>\n\nAccording to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist\u2013Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism |first= David G | last= Rowley | journal = Journal of Contemporary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=321\u201337 |jstor= 260964 | doi=10.1177/002200949703200303}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Rebuilding Russia,\" an essay first published in 1990 in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' Solzhenitsyn urged Russia to grant independence to all the non-Slav republics, which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] that he considered to be [[Russified]].<ref name= RFLSolUKma>{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Solzhenitsyn_Leaves_Troubled_Legacy_Across_Former_Soviet_Union/1188876.html | title = Solzhenitsyn Leaves Troubled Legacy Across Former Soviet Union | newspaper = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | date = 6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Daniel J.

The earliest [[charter]] was granted by [[William the Lion]] in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby [[Forest of Stocket]], whose income formed the basis for the city's [[Common Good Fund (Aberdeen)|Common Good Fund]] which still benefits Aberdonians.<ref name=\"keith\">{{Cite book|author=Keith, Alexander|year=1987|title=A Thousand Years of Aberdeen |publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"fraser\">{{Cite book|first=W.

The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.\n[[File:The Powis gate Old Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 421948.jpg|thumb|upright|The Powis gate Old Aberdeen]]\n\nDuring the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Battle of Aberdeen]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}}</ref> and two years later [[Battle of Aberdeen (1646)|it was stormed]] by a Royalist force under the command of the [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly]].<ref>{{Cite DNB|ref=harv|last=Henderson |first=Thomas Finlayson |wstitle=Gordon, George (d.1649)  |volume=22 |pages=190\u2013194}}</ref> In 1647 an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] killed a quarter of the population. In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary|Infirmary]] at [[Woolmanhill Hospital|Woolmanhill]] in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], [[King Street, Aberdeen|King Street]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] all completed at the beginning of the 19th century.\n[[File:Union Terrace Aberdeen Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Union Terrace, Aberdeen, circa 1900]]\n\nThe expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]], an economic downturn immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.<ref name=\"fraser\"/> The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter, it is no longer officially independent. It is an integral part of the city, as is Woodside and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of the River Dee.\n\n===Toponymy===\n{{Main article|Etymology of Aberdeen}}\nAberdeen was in [[Picts|Pictish]] territory and became Gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period. Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of ''Aberdon'', the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means \"the mouth of the Don\".

This motif dates from at least the time of [[Robert the Bruce]] and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval Aberdeen: Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|Castlegate]]); the city gate on Port Hill; and a church on St Catherine's Hill (now levelled).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html |title=Aberdeen City|accessdate=15 May 2007|author=Gazetter for Scotland}}</ref>\n\n''Bon Accord'' is the [[motto]] of the city and is French for \"Good Agreement\".

This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian \"Old Red\" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480\u2013600&nbsp;million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetter for Scotland|accessdate=10 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]] and the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]], which turns into high [[sand dunes]] north of the Don stretching as far as [[Fraserburgh]]; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.\n\nThe city extends to {{convert|{{Scottish council populations|ARE=S12000033}}|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"area source\">{{United Kingdom district population citation|area}}</ref> and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, [[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]] and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]].

These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.\nUntil the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when [[Richards of Aberdeen]] closed.\n\nGrey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at [[Rubislaw quarry]] for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19296757|title=Water pumping work starts at Rubislaw Quarry in Aberdeen|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century.

The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]]. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.\n[[File:Aberdeen Harbour from Air.jpg|thumb|left|Aberdeen Harbour from the Air]]\nGeologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen.\n\nBy late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.\n\nThe industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century.\n\nAs a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has a port chaplain in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them.\n\n===Business===\nIn 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|title=Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|title=Record rise in North Sea oil and gas investment expected|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 August 2013}}</ref> This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Construction gets underway for new GDF Suez E&P UK Aberdeen premises|website=|publisher=GDF Suez E&P|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830085637/http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang%3Den|archive-date=30 August 2017|dead-url=yes|accessdate=3 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over \u00a311.4 billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP.

The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their fa\u00e7ade being restored back to much how they looked originally.\n\nAmongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|the Music Hall]], the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen|Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades]] (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]].

Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became [[Robert Gordon University]]. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It was previously ''The Sunday Times'' Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: \"''With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year''\".<ref>The Sunday Times, 12 September 2010 (subscription only)</ref> \n\nRGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at [[Garthdee]] and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to Robert Gordon's College, and the building now functions as the school's Science and Technology Centre. The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the dubious distinction of having two universities but no student bar.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:RGU Riverside East building 1.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Gordon University \u2013 Sir Ian Wood building]]\n[[File:Aberdeen College - geograph.org.uk - 852689.jpg|thumb|right|North East Scotland College]]\nAberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: [[Gray's School of Art]], founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK.

The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants ([[anti-king]]s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.\n\nThe [[Western Schism]]\u2014which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of [[Pope Urban VI]] was invalid, elected antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as a rival to the Roman Pope\u2014led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes: the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon line]] (Clement VII took up residence in [[Avignon]], France), and the [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] line. The Pisan line, which began in 1409, was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected antipope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the [[Council of Constance]] deposed antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line. [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed antipope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment and fed into the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n== List of historical antipopes ==\n\nThe following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', with the addition of the names of Natalius (in spite of doubts about his historicity) and [[Antipope Clement VIII]] (whose following was insignificant).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm Michael Ott, \"Pope Martin V\" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1910)]</ref>\n \nAn asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. More commonly, the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers; for example, there was an [[Antipope John XXIII]], but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see [[Pope John (numbering)]].\n\nThe list of popes and antipopes in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' attaches the following note to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963\u2013965):\n<blockquote>\nAt this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across [[Papal conclave|elections]] in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.<ref>Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p.&nbsp;12*</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThus, because of the obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' lists [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester III]] as a pope, without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' places him in its ''List of Popes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: List of Popes|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> but with the annotation: \"Considered by some to be an antipope\".

It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, [[fish pond]]s, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[tilapia]], and [[catfish]].<ref name=\"faostat\" />\n\nIn the Mediterranean, young [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore.

Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]].\n\nA similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Farming the Sea|first=Frank|last=Asche|journal=Marine Resource Economics|volume=23|issue=4|year=2008|pages=527\u2013547 |jstor=42629678|doi=10.1086/mre.23.4.42629678}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Future Seascapes, Fishing, and Fish Farming|first=Rebecca |last=Goldburg |first2=Rosamond |last2=Naylor|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|date=February 2005|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.2307/3868441|jstor=3868441}}</ref> An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry.

Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium|access-date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232001/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|archive-date=2013-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[Freshwater prawn farm]]ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming.

This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems.\n\nThe extent of the effects of pollution from sea-cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located, which species are kept, how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed. Important species-specific variables include the species' food conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogen retention. Studies prior to 2001 determined that the amount of nitrogen introduced as feed which is lost to the water column and seafloor as waste varies from 52 to 95%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Genetic modification===\nA type of salmon called the AquAdvantage salmon has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] for faster growth, although it has not been approved for commercial use, due to controversy.<ref>\nMcleod C, J Grice, H Campbell and T Herleth (2006) [http://www.conversations.canterbury.ac.nz/documents/Salmon%20Report.pdf Super Salmon: The Industrialisation of Fish Farming and the Drive Towards GM Technologies in Salmon Production] CSaFe, Discussion paper 5, [[University of Otago]].</ref> The altered salmon incorporates a growth hormone from a [[Chinook salmon]] that allows it to reach full size in 16\u201328 months, instead of the normal 36 months for Atlantic salmon, and while consuming 25 percent less feed.<ref>Robynne Boyd, [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/would-you-eat-aquadvantage-salmon-if-approved/ Would you eat AquAdvantage salmon if approved?] ''Scientific American'' online, 26 April 2013.</ref> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewed the AquAdvantage salmon in a draft environmental assessment and determined that it \"would not have a significant impact (FONSI) on the U.S. environment.\"<ref>FDA: [http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/developmentapprovalprocess/geneticengineering/geneticallyengineeredanimals/ucm280853.htm AquAdvantage Salmon]</ref>\n\n==Ecological benefits==\nWhile some forms of aquaculture can be devastating to ecosystems, such as shrimp farming in mangroves, other forms can be very beneficial. Shellfish aquaculture adds substantial filter feeding capacity to an environment which can significantly improve water quality. A single oyster can filter 15 gallons of water a day, removing microscopic algal cells. By removing these cells, shellfish are removing nitrogen and other nutrients from the system and either retaining it or releasing it as waste which sinks to the bottom. By harvesting these shellfish the nitrogen they retained is completely removed from the system.<ref>Higgins, Colleen B., Kurt Stephenson, and Bonnie L. Brown. \"Nutrient bioassimilation capacity of aquacultured oysters: quantification of an ecosystem service.\" Journal of environmental quality 40.1 (2011): 271-277.</ref> Raising and harvesting kelp and other macroalgae directly remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Repackaging these nutrients can relieve eutrophic, or nutrient-rich, conditions known for their low dissolved oxygen which can decimate species diversity and abundance of marine life. Removing algal cells from the water also increase light penetration, allowing plants such as eelgrass to reestablish themselves and further increase oxygen levels.\n\nAquaculture in an area can provide for crucial ecological functions for the inhabitants. Shellfish beds or cages can provide habitat structure. This structure can be used as shelter by invertebrates, small fish or crustaceans to potentially increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity. Increased shelter raises stocks of prey fish and small crustaceans by increasing recruitment opportunities in turn providing more prey for higher trophic levels. One study estimated that 10 square meters of oyster reef could enhance an ecosystem's biomass by 2.57&nbsp;kg<ref>Peterson, Charles H., Jonathan H. Grabowski, and Sean P. Powers. \"Estimated enhancement of fish production resulting from restoring oyster reef habitat: quantitative valuation.\" Marine Ecology Progress Series 264 (2003): 249-264.</ref> The shellfish acting as herbivores will also be preyed on. This moves energy directly from primary producers to higher trophic levels potentially skipping out on multiple energetically-costly trophic jumps which would increase biomass in the ecosystem.\n\n==Animal welfare==\n{{see also|Pain in fish|Pain in invertebrates}}\nAs with the farming of terrestrial animals, social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals.  Under the guidelines advised by the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal's physical and mental state. This can be defined by the [[Five Freedoms]]:\n* Freedom from hunger & thirst\n* Freedom from discomfort\n* Freedom from pain, disease, or injury\n* Freedom to express normal behaviour\n* Freedom from fear and distress\n\nHowever, the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually [[sentient]], or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering.

Keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation.\n\nNot surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures. However, prevention methods, such as vaccination, can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection.<ref name=\"Ashley\" /> Other methods include adding antibiotics to feed, adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control, such as using [[cleaner fish|cleaner wrasse]] to remove lice from farmed salmon.<ref name=\"Ashley\" />\n\nMany steps are involved in transport, including capture, food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water, transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps, plus transport and transfer to the delivery location.

It is named after [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], who first published on the subject in 1963.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Andrey Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|last=Kolmogorov|year=1963|title=On Tables of Random Numbers| journal=Sankhy\u0101 Ser.

The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has '''32''' characters.\n\nMore formally, the [[complexity]] of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed [[Turing complete|universal]] description language (the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below). It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the ''abab'' example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex.\n\nThe Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings.  Such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[Java virtual machine]] bytecode.  If '''P''' is a program which outputs a string ''x'', then '''P''' is a description of ''x''. The length of the description is just the length of '''P''' as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character (e.g. 7 for [[ASCII]]).\n\nWe could, alternatively, choose an encoding for [[Turing machine]]s, where an ''encoding'' is a function which associates to each Turing Machine '''M''' a bitstring <'''M'''>. If '''M''' is a Turing Machine which, on input ''w'', outputs string ''x'', then the concatenated string <'''M'''> ''w'' is a description of ''x''. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.\n\nAny string ''s'' has at least one description. For example, the above string is output by the program:\n\n  '''function''' GenerateExample2String()\n     '''return''' \"4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7\"\n\nwhere the first string is output by the (much shorter) pseudo-code:\n\n  '''function''' GenerateExample1String()\n     '''return''' \"ab\" * 16\n\nIf a description ''d''(''s'') of a string ''s'' is of minimal length (i.e. it uses the fewest bits), it is called a '''minimal description''' of ''s''.  Thus, the length of ''d''(''s'') (i.e. the number of bits in the description) is the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of ''s'', written ''K''(''s''). Symbolically,\n\n:''K''(''s'') = |''d''(''s'')|.\n\nThe length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language; but the effect of changing languages is bounded (a result called the ''invariance theorem''). The standard textbook is authored by [[Ming Li]] and [[Paul Vitanyi]]  \nin the references.\n\n==Invariance theorem==\n\n===Informal treatment===\nThere are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described.\n\nHere is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts:\n\n* The first part describes another description language.\n* The second part is a description of the object in that language.\n\nIn more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.\n\n'''The invariance theorem follows:''' Given any description language ''L'', the optimal description language is at least as efficient as ''L'', with some constant overhead.\n\n'''Proof:''' Any description ''D'' in ''L'' can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing ''L'' as a computer program ''P'' (part 1), and then using the original description ''D'' as input to that program (part 2). The\ntotal length of this new description ''D&prime;'' is (approximately):\n\n:|''D&prime;''| = |''P''| + |''D''|\n\nThe length of ''P'' is a constant that doesn't depend on ''D''. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. Therefore, the optimal language is universal [[up to]] this additive constant.\n\n===A more formal treatment===\n'''Theorem''': If ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub> are the complexity functions relative to [[Turing complete]] description languages ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub>, then there is a constant ''c''&nbsp;\u2013 which depends only on the languages ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> chosen&nbsp;\u2013 such that\n\n:\u2200''s''.  \u2212''c'' \u2264 ''K''<sub>1</sub>(''s'') \u2212 ''K''<sub>2</sub>(''s'') \u2264 ''c''.\n\n'''Proof''': By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant ''c'' such that for all strings ''s''\n\n:''K''<sub>1</sub>(''s'') \u2264 ''K''<sub>2</sub>(''s'') + ''c''.\n\nNow, suppose there is a program in the language ''L''<sub>1</sub> which acts as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for ''L''<sub>2</sub>:\n\n   '''function''' InterpretLanguage('''string''' ''p'')\n\nwhere ''p'' is a program in ''L''<sub>2</sub>. The interpreter is characterized by the following property:\n\n: Running <code>InterpretLanguage</code> on input ''p'' returns the result of running ''p''.\n\nThus, if '''P''' is a program in ''L''<sub>2</sub> which is a minimal description of ''s'', then <code>InterpretLanguage</code>('''P''') returns the string ''s''.

This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a \"universal probability\" of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.\n\nWhen Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Kolmogorov | first1=A. | title=Logical basis for information theory and probability theory | journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=14|issue=5 | pages=662\u2013664 | year=1968 | doi =10.1109/TIT.1968.1054210 }}</ref> For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World.

The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity.

The most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s, and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).\n\nAn axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov (Burgin 1982).\n\n==Basic results==\nIn the following discussion, let ''K''(''s'') be the complexity of the string ''s''.\n\nIt is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself&nbsp;\u2014 the program <code>GenerateFixedString</code> above that outputs ''s'' is a fixed amount larger than ''s''.\n\n'''Theorem''': There is a constant ''c'' such that\n\n:\u2200''s''.

In other words, there is no program which takes a string ''s'' as input and produces the integer ''K''(''s'') as output.\n\nThe following [[indirect proof|indirect '''proof''']] uses a simple [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like language to denote programs; for sake of proof simplicity assume its description (i.e. an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]) to have a length of {{val|1400000}} bits.\nAssume for contradiction there is a program\n\n   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' s)\n\nwhich takes as input a string ''s'' and returns ''K''(''s''); for sake of proof simplicity, assume the program's length to be {{val|7000000000}} bits.\nNow, consider the following program of length {{val|1288}} bits:\n\n   '''function''' GenerateComplexString()\n      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:\n         '''for each''' string s '''of''' length exactly i\n            '''if''' KolmogorovComplexity(s) >= 8000000000\n               '''return''' s\n\nUsing <code>KolmogorovComplexity</code> as a subroutine, the program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it returns a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least {{val|8000000000}} bits,<ref group=\"note\">By the previous theorem, such a string exists, hence the <code>for</code> loop will eventually terminate.</ref> i.e. a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than {{val|8000000000}} bits. However, the overall length of the above program that produced ''s'' is only {{val|7001401288}} bits,<ref group=note>including the language interpreter and the subroutine code for <code>KolmogorovComplexity</code></ref> which is a contradiction. (If the code of <code>KolmogorovComplexity</code> is shorter, the contradiction remains. If it is longer, the constant used in <code>GenerateComplexString</code> can always be changed appropriately.)<ref group=note>If <code>KolmogorovComplexity</code> has length ''n'' bits, the constant ''m'' used in <code>GenerateComplexString</code> needs to be adapted to satisfy {{nobreak|''n'' + {{val|1400000}} + {{val|1218}} + 7\u00b7log<sub>10</sub>(''m'') < ''m''}}, which is always possible since ''m'' grows faster than log<sub>10</sub>(''m'').</ref>\n\nThe above proof uses a contradiction similar to that of the [[Berry paradox]]: \"<sub>{{color|#8080ff|1}}</sub>The <sub>{{color|#8080ff|2}}</sub>smallest <sub>{{color|#8080ff|3}}</sub>positive <sub>{{color|#8080ff|4}}</sub>integer <sub>{{color|#8080ff|5}}</sub>that <sub>{{color|#8080ff|6}}</sub>cannot <sub>{{color|#8080ff|7}}</sub>be <sub>{{color|#8080ff|8}}</sub>defined <sub>{{color|#8080ff|9}}</sub>in <sub>{{color|#8080ff|10}}</sub>fewer <sub>{{color|#8080ff|11}}</sub>than <sub>{{color|#8080ff|12}}</sub>twenty <sub>{{color|#8080ff|13}}</sub>English <sub>{{color|#8080ff|14}}</sub>words\". It is also possible to show the non-computability of ''K'' by reduction from the non-computability of the halting problem ''H'', since ''K'' and ''H'' are [[turing degree#Turing equivalence|Turing-equivalent]].<ref>Stated without proof in: [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~bromille/DC05/Kolmogorov.pdf \"Course notes for Data Compression - Kolmogorov complexity\"], 2005, P.

Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input ''s''. If the result matches the length of the program is returned.\n\nHowever this will not work because some of the programs ''p'' tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.\n\n===Chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity===\n{{Main| Chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity}}\nThe chain rule<ref>{{cite news\n  | first = A.\n  | last = Zvonkin\n  |author2=L.

Using this statement, one can define [[Mutual information#Absolute mutual information|an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity]].\n\n==Compression==\nIt is straightforward to compute upper bounds for ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2013 simply [[data compression|compress]] the string ''s'' with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the length of the resulting string&nbsp;\u2013 concretely, the size of a [[self-extracting archive]] in the given language.\n\nA string ''s'' is compressible by a number ''c'' if it has a description whose length does not exceed |''s''| \u2212 ''c'' bits. This is equivalent to saying that ''K''(''s'') \u2264 |''s''| \u2212 ''c''.  Otherwise, ''s'' is incompressible by ''c''. A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply ''incompressible''&nbsp;\u2013 by the [[pigeonhole principle]], which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string, [[incompressible string]]s must exist, since there are 2<sup>''n''</sup> bit strings of length ''n'', but only 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1 shorter strings, that is, strings of length less than ''n'', (i.e. with length 0, 1, \u2026, ''n&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1).<ref group=note>As there are {{nobr|1=''N''<sub>''L''</sub> = 2<sup>''L''</sup>}} strings of length ''L'', the number of strings of lengths {{nowrap|1=''L'' = 0, 1, \u2026, ''n'' \u2212 1}} is {{nobr|''N''<sub>0</sub> + ''N''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''N''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>}} = {{nobr|2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + \u2026 + 2<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}}, which is a finite [[geometric series]] with sum {{nobr|2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + \u2026 + 2<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}} = {{nobr|1 = 2<sup>0</sup> \u00d7 (1 \u2212 2<sup>''n''</sup>) / (1 \u2212 2) = 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}}</ref>\n\nFor the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed&nbsp;\u2013 their ''K''(''s'') is not much smaller than |''s''|, the length of ''s'' in bits. To make this precise, fix a value of ''n''. There are 2<sup>''n''</sup> bitstrings of length ''n''. The [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] [[probability]] distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> to each string of length ''n''.\n\n'''Theorem''': With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length ''n'', the probability that a string is incompressible by ''c'' is at least 1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''c''+1</sup> + 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nTo prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding ''n'' \u2212 ''c'' is given by the geometric series:\n\n: 1 + 2 + 2<sup>2</sup> + \u2026 + 2<sup>''n'' \u2212 ''c''</sup> = 2<sup>''n''\u2212''c''+1</sup> \u2212 1.\n\nThere remain at least\n\n: 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 2<sup>''n''\u2212''c''+1</sup> + 1\n\nbitstrings of length ''n'' that are incompressible by ''c''.  To determine the probability, divide by 2<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n==Chaitin's incompleteness theorem==\n[[File:Kolmogorov complexity and computable lower bounds.gif|thumb|right|500px|Kolmogorov complexity {{color|#800000|''K''(''s'')}}, and two computable lower bound functions <code>{{color|#808000|prog1(s)}}</code>, <code>{{color|#008000|prog2(s)}}</code>. The horizontal axis ([[logarithmic scale]]) enumerates all [[string (computer science)|strings]] ''s'', ordered by length; the vertical axis ([[linear scale]]) measures Kolmogorov complexity in [[bit]]s. Most strings are incompressible, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity exceeds their length by a constant amount. 17 compressible strings are shown in the picture, appearing as almost vertical slopes. Due to Chaitin's incompleteness theorem (1974), the output of any program computing a lower bound of the Kolmogorov complexity cannot exceed some fixed limit, which is independent of the input string ''s''.]]\nWe know that, in the set of all possible strings, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly \"compressed\" way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven, if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First, fix a particular [[axiomatic system]] '''S''' for the [[natural number]]s. The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that, to certain assertions  '''A''' about complexity of strings, one can associate a formula '''F'''<sub>'''A'''</sub> in '''S'''. This association must have the following property:\n\nIf '''F'''<sub>'''A'''</sub> is provable from the axioms of '''S''', then the corresponding assertion '''A''' must be true. This \"formalization\" can be achieved, either by an artificial encoding such as a [[G\u00f6del numbering]], or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of '''S'''.\n\n'''Theorem''': There exists a constant ''L'' (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string ''s'' for which the statement\n\n:''K''(''s'') \u2265  ''L'' (as formalized in '''S''')\n\ncan be proven within the axiomatic system '''S'''.\n\nNote that, by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true.\n\nThe proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in [[Berry's paradox]]. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then\n\n:'''Assumption (X)''': For any integer ''n'' there exists a string ''s'' for which there is a proof in '''S''' of the formula \"''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''n''\" (which we assume can be formalized in '''S''').\n\nWe can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in '''S''' by some procedure\n\n   '''function''' NthProof('''int''' ''n'')\nwhich takes as input ''n'' and outputs some proof. This function enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of '''S''' is produced for some ''n''. Some of these are complexity formulas of the form ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''n'' where ''s'' and ''n'' are constants in the language of '''S'''. There is a program\n\n   '''function''' NthProofProvesComplexityFormula('''int''' ''n'')\n\nwhich determines whether the ''n''th proof actually proves a complexity formula ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''L''. The strings ''s'', and the integer ''L'' in turn, are computable by programs:\n\n   '''function''' StringNthProof('''int''' ''n'')\n\n   '''function''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof('''int''' ''n'')\n\nConsider the following program\n\n   '''function''' GenerateProvablyComplexString('''int''' ''n'')\n      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:\n         '''if'''  NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) '''and''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) \u2265 ''n''\n            '''return''' StringNthProof(''i'')\n\nGiven an ''n'', this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the [[formal system]] '''S''' of the formula ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''L'' for some ''L''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''n''. The program terminates by our '''Assumption (X)'''. Now, this program has a length ''U''. There is an integer ''n''<sub>0</sub> such that ''U''&nbsp;+&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''n''<sub>0</sub>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;''C''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n''<sub>0</sub>, where ''C'' is the overhead cost of\n\n    '''function''' GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString()\n       '''return''' GenerateProvablyComplexString(''n''<sub>0</sub>)\n\n(note that ''n''<sub>0</sub> is hard-coded into the above function, and the summand log<sub>2</sub>(''n''<sub>0</sub>) already allows for its encoding). The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string ''s'' for which there exists an ''L'' such that ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''L'' can be formally proved in '''S''' with ''L''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''n''<sub>0</sub>. In particular, ''K''(''s'')&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''n''<sub>0</sub> is true. However, ''s'' is also described by a program of length ''U''&nbsp;+&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''n''<sub>0</sub>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;''C'', so its complexity is less than ''n''<sub>0</sub>.  This contradiction proves '''Assumption (X)''' cannot hold.\n\nSimilar ideas are used to prove the properties of [[Chaitin's constant]].\n\n==Minimum message length==\n{{Main|Minimum message length}}\nThe minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|C.S. Wallace]] and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).\n\n==Kolmogorov randomness==\n{{See also|Algorithmic randomness}}\n''Kolmogorov randomness'' defines a string (usually of [[bit]]s) as being [[randomness|random]] if and only if it is shorter than any [[computer program]] that can produce that string.  To make this precise, a [[Universal Turing machine|universal computer]] (or universal Turing machine) must be specified, so that \"program\" means a program for this universal machine. A random string in this sense is \"incompressible\" in that it is impossible to \"compress\" the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself.  A [[counting argument]] is used to show that, for any universal computer, there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length.  Whether any particular string is random, however, depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen.\n\nThis definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for ''infinite'' sequences from a finite alphabet. These [[algorithmically random sequence]]s can be defined in three equivalent ways. One way uses an effective analogue of [[measure theory]]; another uses effective [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]].  The third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough&nbsp;\u2014 there must be a constant ''c'' such that the complexity of an initial segment of length ''n'' is always at least ''n''\u2212''c''.  This definition, unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string, is not affected by which universal machine is used to define prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(66)80018-9 |title=The definition of random sequences |journal=Information and Control |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=602\u2013619 |year=1966 |last1=Martin-L\u00f6f |first1=Per }}</ref>\n\n==Relation to entropy==\nFor dynamical systems, entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of Brudno, that the equality K(x;T) =  h(T) holds for almost all x.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Stefano Galatolo, Mathieu Hoyrup, Crist\u00f3bal Rojas |title=Effective symbolic dynamics, random points, statistical behavior, complexity and entropy | journal=Information and Computation | volume=208 | pages=23\u201341 | year=2010| url=http://www.loria.fr/~hoyrup/random_ergodic.pdf | doi=10.1016/j.ic.2009.05.001}}</ref>\n\nIt can be shown<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=Alexei Kaltchenko |title=Algorithms for Estimating Information Distance with Application to Bioinformatics and Linguistics  |year=2004 |eprint=cs.CC/0404039}}</ref> that for the output of [[Markov information source]]s, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the information source.

His father died when he was young and three of Alfred's brothers reigned in turn. Taking the throne after the death of his brother [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], Alfred spent several years dealing with Viking invasions. After a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878 Alfred made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as [[Danelaw]] in the [[North of England]]. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of the Viking leader, [[Guthrum]].\n\nAlfred successfully defended his kingdom against the [[Viking]] attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in [[England]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328 }} He was also the first [[List of kings of Wessex|King of the West Saxons]] to style himself \"[[King of the Anglo-Saxons]]\". Details of Alfred's life are described in a work by the [[9th century in England|9th-century]] [[Welsh people|Welsh]] scholar and bishop [[Asser]].\n\nAlfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be conducted in [[Old English|English]] rather than Latin, and improved his kingdom's [[law|legal]] system, [[military]] structure, and his people's quality of life. He was given the [[epithet]] \"the Great\" during and after the [[Reformation]] in the sixteenth century. The only other king of England given this epithet is [[Cnut the Great]]. In 2002, Alfred was ranked number 14 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Further|House of Wessex family tree}}\n[[File:\u00c6thelwulf - MS Royal 14 B VI.jpg|thumb|Alfred's father \u00c6thelwulf in the early fourteenth-century ''Genealogical Roll of the Kings of England'']]\nAlfred was born in the village of Wanating, now [[Wantage]], historically in [[Berkshire]] but now in [[Oxfordshire]]. He was the youngest son of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] by his first wife, [[Osburh]].{{efn|Alfred was the youngest of either four (Weir, Alison, ''Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy'' (1989), p.5) or five brothers,{{sfn|Crown staff|2011}} the primary record conflicting regarding whether [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex]] was a brother or uncle.}}\n\nIn 853, at the age of four, Alfred is reported by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to have been sent to Rome where he was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by [[Pope Leo IV]], who \"anointed him as king\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 853}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"[[consul]]\"; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}} It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]], around 854\u2013855.\n\nOn their return from Rome in 856 \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son [[\u00c6thelbald of Wessex|\u00c6thelbald]]. With civil war looming the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. \u00c6thelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf would rule in the east. When King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, [[\u00c6thelberht of Wessex|\u00c6thelberht]] and [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].{{sfn|Crofton|2006|p=8}}\n\nBishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won as a prize a book of Saxon poems, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it.{{sfn|Asser|866|loc=paragraph 23}} Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]].{{sfn|Craig|1991|pp=303\u201305}} Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.{{sfn|Cornwell|2009|loc=\"Historical Note\" (p. 385 and following)}}\n\n==Reigns of Alfred's brothers==\n[[File:England Great Army map.svg|thumb|A map of the route taken by the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] which arrived in England from Denmark, Norway, and southern Sweden in 865.]]\n\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' describes the [[Great Heathen Army]], an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=16\u201317}} Alfred's public life began at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old King \u00c6thelred, in 865.\n\nDuring this period, Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of \"secundarius\", which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic \"[[Tanistry|tanist]]\", a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It is well known among other [[Germanic peoples]] to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander, such as among the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] and [[Franks]], to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.\n\n===Fighting the Viking invasion===\nIn 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside \u00c6thelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the [[Great Heathen Army]] led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 868}}  The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with varying outcomes, though the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.\n\nA successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|siege and Battle of Reading]] by Ivar's brother [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}\n\nThe Saxons were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]).{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} \u00c6thelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April.\n\n==King at war==\n\n===Early struggles, defeat and flight===\nIn April 871 King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though \u00c6thelred left two under-age sons, [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]]. This was in accordance with the agreement that \u00c6thelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at \"Swinbeorg\". The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King \u00c6thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them, and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.\n\nWhile he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\nIndeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser, or by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140\u201341}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and [[Waterloo Bridge]]. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.{{sfn|Brooks|Graham-Campbell|1986|pp=91\u2013110}}\n\nIn 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a \"holy ring\"{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 876}} associated with the worship of [[Thor]].{{sfn|Arnold|2011|p=37}} The Danes broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]].{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 877}}\n\nAlfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and, with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, \"and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe.\"{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}\n\nA legend, originating from 12th century chronicles,{{sfn|Crown staff|2011}} tells how when he first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.\n\n878 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=101}}\n\n===Counter-attack and victory===\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on the supposed site of \"Egbert's Stone\", the mustering place before the [[Battle of Edington]].{{efn|The inscription reads \"ALFRED THE GREAT AD 879 on this Summit Erected his Standard Against Danish Invaders To him We owe The Origin of Juries The Establishment of a Militia The Creation of a Naval Force ALFRED The Light of a Benighted Age Was a Philosopher and a Christian The Father of his People The Founder of the English MONARCHY and LIBERTY\" {{harv|Horspool|2006|pages=73}} }}]]\n\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4\u201310 May 878), around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to [[Egbert's Stone]] east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]] where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of [[Wiltshire]] and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of [[Southampton Water]]), and they rejoiced to see him\".{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 878}} Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeves]] and king's [[thegn]]s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pages=187\u201391}}\n\nAlfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Edington]] which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}} He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at [[Chippenham]] and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to [[Christianity]]. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=582}}\n\nAccording to Asser:\n\n<blockquote>The unbinding of the [[chrisom]] {{efn| A \"chrisom\" was the face-cloth or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he or she was [[baptism|baptised]] or christened. Originally the purpose of the chrisom-cloth was to keep the \"chrism\", a consecrated oil, from accidentally rubbing off.{{sfn|Nares|1859|p=160}}}} on the eighth day took place at a royal estate called [[Wedmore]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 56}}</blockquote>\n\nWhile at Wedmore Alfred and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], but it was to be some years after the cessation of hostilities that a formal treaty was signed.{{sfn|Horspool|2006|pages=123\u201324}} Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. {{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=Ch. 60}} The formal [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in [[Old English]] in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a [[Latin]] compilation known as \"[[Quadripartitus]]\", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}\n\nThat treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]] to the [[River Lea]], follow the Lea to its source (near [[Luton]]), from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]], and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=98\u2013101, [https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/98/mode/2up Treaty of Alfred and Gunthrum]}}\n\nIn other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged [[kingdom of East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints\u2014at least for the time being.{{sfn|Blackburn|1998|pp=105\u201324}} The disposition of [[Essex]], held by West Saxon kings since the days of [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], is unclear from the treaty though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.\n\n===Quiet years, restoration of London (880s)===\n{{further|Londinium|Anglo-Saxon London}}\n[[File:Alfred king of Wessex London 880.jpg|thumb|A coin of Alfred, king of Wessex, London, 880 (based upon a Roman model).<br />'''''Obv''''': King with royal band in profile, with legend: \u00c6LFRED REX \"King \u00c6lfred\"]]\n\nWith the signing of the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling [[East Anglia]], Guthrum was neutralised as a threat.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=94}} The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878\u2013879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879\u2013892.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=250\u201351}}\n\nAlfred was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships \"on the high seas\",{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces.{{sfn|Alfred|1969|p=76}} Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.\n\nIn 883\u2014though there is some debate over the year\u2014King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=78}} Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus' friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=88}}\n\nAfter the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in [[Kent]], an allied kingdom in [[South East England]], during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=86}} where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}}\n\nNot long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=87}} The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\".{{sfn|Huntingdon|1969|p=81}} The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=86}}\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|A plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred.]]\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again.{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=24}} Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Keynes|1998|p=23}}\n\nThis is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=106}} This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact, he would never adopt the title for himself.\n\nBetween the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, [[\u00c6thelswith]], en route to Rome in 888.{{sfn|Asser|1969|p=114}} In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], \u00c6thelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].{{sfn|Woodruff|1993|p=89}}\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\n\nGuthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power-hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of King Alfred The Great and the Danes|url=http://www.localhistories.org/alfred.html|publisher=Local Histories|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Further Viking attacks repelled (890s)===\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at [[Appledore, Kent]], and the lesser under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}}\n\nWhile he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]], on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] between [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Middlesex]], where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}{{sfn|Merkle|2009|p=220}} They then went to Essex and, after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], joined with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=115\u201316, 286}}\n\nAlfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and East Anglian Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege]] of [[Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nMeanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]] and, forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Battle of Buttington|Buttington]]. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with [[Buttington]] near [[Welshpool]].) An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]] but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\nEarly in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Military reorganisation==\n[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871\u2013899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM \"\u00c6lfred King of the Saxons\".]]\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their [[Conscription|tribal levy]], or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended.{{sfn|Preston|Wise|Werner|1956|p=70}} The fyrd was a local [[militia]] in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.{{sfn|Hollister|1962|pp=59\u201360}}\nAccording to the [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694:\n{{quote|If a nobleman who holds land neglects military service, he shall pay 120 shillings and forfeit his land; a nobleman who holds no land shall pay 60 shillings; a commoner shall pay a fine of 30 shillings for neglecting military service.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}} }}\n\nWessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a [[shield wall]], advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nIn contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThese bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, [[defensive wall|ramparts]] and [[palisade]]s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=194\u201395}}\n\nThe means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=139, 152}}{{sfn|Cannon|1997|p=398}}\n\nWith these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with [[Charles the Bald]] and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=194}}{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}<ref>{{harvnb|Lavelle|2010|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Administration and taxation===\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ''trinoda necessitas'' or ''trimoda necessitas''.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}} The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was {{lang|ang|fierdwite}}.{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nTo maintain the [[burh]]s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The \"hide\" was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A \"hide\" is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The \"hide\" would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many \"hides\" he owned.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=70\u201373}}{{sfn|Lapidge|2001}}\n\n===Burghal system===\n{{See also|Burghal Hidage}}\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon burhs.svg|thumb|A map of [[burh]]s named in the [[Burghal Hidage]].]]\n\nAt the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of [[burh]]s, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=95}} There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off}} apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.{{sfn|Hull|2006|p=xx}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=203}}\n\nAlfred's burhs (later termed [[boroughs]]) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden [[revetment]]s and palisades, such as at Burpham, Sussex.{{sfn|Welch|1992|p=127}}{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=304}} The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at [[Winchester]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bradshaw|1999}}, which is referenced in {{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=xx}}</ref>\n\nA contemporary document now known as the [[Burghal Hidage]] provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the \"hidage\" for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a \"hidage\" of 2400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining {{convert|9900|ft|km|abbr=off}} of wall.{{sfn|Hill|Rumble|1996|p=5}} A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system-wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=204\u201307}}\n\nMany of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by [[Charles the Bald]] a generation before.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=198\u2013202}}\nThe burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as \"[[herepath]]s\"). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader.{{sfn|Lavelle|2003|p=26}} This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. The Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well-maintained army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=204, 304}} Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892, and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in [[Kent]], the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=287, 304}}\n\nAlfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".<ref>Asser, translated by {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}}</ref>{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=206}}\n\n===English navy===\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]]. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. [[\u00c6thelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships,{{sfn|Savage|1988|pp=86\u201388}} and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=97}}\n\nNevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{harvnb|Gifford|Gifford|2003|pp=281\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAlfred had seapower in mind\u2014if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=305\u201307}}\n\nThe warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}}\n\nIn the one recorded naval engagement in 896{{sfn|Giles|Ingram|1996|loc=Year 896}}{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}} Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded and proceeded to kill the Vikings. One ship escaped, because Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} A land battle ensued between the crews. The Danes were heavily outnumbered, but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which, with shallower drafts, were freed first. The English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} But they had suffered so many casualties (120 dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at [[Selsey Bill]]).{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}{{sfn|Lavelle|2010|pp=286\u201397}} The shipwrecked crew were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.{{sfn|Savage|1988|p=111}}\n\n==Legal reform==\n{{Main|Doom book}}\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of Alfred.]]\nIn the late 880s or early 890s Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]] consisting of his \"own\" laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]].{{sfn|Attenborough|1922|pp=62\u201393}} Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"[[synod]]-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed\u2014those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\".<ref>\"Alfred\" Int. 49.9, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred singled out in particular the laws that he \"found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] who first among the English people received baptism\". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and, although he included, as had \u00c6thelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=280\u201381}}\n\nAbout a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the \"Apostolic Letter\" from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23\u201329). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=215}} It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}}\n\nSimilarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=417}} The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the \"Apostolic Letter\" which explained that Christ \"had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness\". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods \"established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed\".<ref name=keynes>\"Alfred\" Intro, 49.7, trans. {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=164\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord \"since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself\".<ref name=keynes/> Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from \"Love your neighbour as yourself\" (Matt. 22:39\u201340) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.<ref>{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites \"Alfred's Pastoral Care\" ch. 28</ref>\n\nWhen one turns from the domboc's introduction to the laws themselves it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact several of Alfred's laws contradicted [[Ine of Wessex#Laws|the laws of Ine]] that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship \"designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction\".{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=427}} In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: \"We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge\" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.<ref>\"Alfred\" 2, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=164}}.</ref>\n\nAlfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".<ref>Asser chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=109}}</ref> A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.<ref>The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in {{harvnb|Whitelock|1996|pp=544\u2013546}}.</ref>\n\nAsser represents Alfred as a [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomonic]] judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.<ref>Asser, chap. 106, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=109\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England,{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}} whereas Asser's ''The Life of King Alfred'' promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=48\u201350}}\n\n==Foreign relations==\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[Pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}}{{efn|Some versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" reported that Alfred sent a delegation to India, although this could just mean Asia as other versions say \"Iudea\".{{harv|Abels|1998|pp=190\u201392}}}} Around 890 [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] undertook a journey from [[Hedeby]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.{{sfn|Orosius|Hampson|1855|p=16}}\n\nAlfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain|Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim \"Scots\" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]], though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}}\n\n==Religion and culture==\n[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow-Alfred.jpg|thumb|King Alfred the Great pictured in a stained glass window in the West Window of the South Transept of [[Bristol Cathedral]].]]\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.<ref>Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. \"King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey\". Simon Keynes. Dorset County Council 1999</ref>\n\nThis revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\";{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.{{sfn|Gransden|1996|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nVery little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=201}} According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAlfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{sfn|Ranft|2012|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}\n\nHe was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.{{sfn|Sweet|1871|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Fleming|1985}}\n\n===Impact of Danish raids on education===\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=125}} Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=55}} That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=265\u201368}}\n\nManuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.{{sfn|Dumville|1992|p=190}} Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian [[Nicholas Brooks]] posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. \"It is clear\", Brooks concludes, \"that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship\".{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=172\u201373}}\n\n===Establishment of a court school===\nFollowing the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=28\u201329}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\".<ref>Asser chap. 75, in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983}} pp. 90\u201391.

[[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Advocacy of education in the English language===\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\".<ref>Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' in {{harvnb|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=126}}</ref> Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in [[Old English|English]], with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nThere were few \"books of wisdom\" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed \"most necessary for all men to know\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=125\u201326}} It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as \"Alfredian\" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.<ref>Janet M. Bately, 'Alfred as Author and Translator' in ''A Companion to Alfred the Great'', ed. by Nicole Guenther Discenza and Paul E. Szarmach (Leiden: Brill, 2014), pp. 113\u201342, {{doi|10.1163/9789004283763_006}}.</ref>\n\nApart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridio'', which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of [[Gregory the Great]], a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=583}} Remarkably Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''\", [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'' and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]].<ref name=\"Bately\">{{harvnb|Bately|1970|pp=433\u201360}}; {{harvnb|Bately|1990|pp=45\u201378}}.</ref>\n\nOne might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.<ref name=\"Bately\"/> Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'' explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating \"sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense\", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Interest in Alfred's translation of ''Pastoral Care'' was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.{{sfn|Paul|2015|loc=MS Ii.2.4}}\n\nBoethius'''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the ''Pastoral Care'' the [[Metres of Boethius|Alfredian text]] deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself{{sfn|Schepss|1895|pp=149\u201360}} but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: \"To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=133}} The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these<ref>{{citation|publisher=Oxford Bodleian Library|title=MS Bodley 180}}</ref> the writing is prose, in the other<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1|publisher=British Library|title=Cotton MS Otho A.|volume=vi}}</ref> a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfn|Kiernan|1998|loc=Alfred the Great's Burnt \"Boethius\"}}\n\nThe last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name ''Blostman'', i.e. \"Blooms\" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. \"Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.\"{{sfn|Plummer|1911|p=584}} Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=115\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel right way up.jpg|thumb|2A drawing of the Alfred Jewel.]]\n[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]], in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, commissioned by Alfred.]]\nThe [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN (Alfred ordered me to be made). The jewel is about {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm|abbr=off}} long, made of [[filigree]]d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn\u00e9 enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.{{sfn|Pratt|2007|pp=189\u201391}}\n\nIt was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the \"\u00e6stels\"\u2014pointers for reading\u2014that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each \"\u00e6stel\" was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=203\u201306}}\n\nHistorian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=124\u201345}} The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: \"Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it\".{{sfn|Sedgefield|1900|p=35}}\n\nThe portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219\u201357}}\n\n==Appearance and character==\n[[File:AlfredtheGreatbyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|thumb|right|175px|No known portrait of Alfred the Great exists from life. A likeness by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from his physical description mentioned in historical records.]]\n[[Asser]] wrote of Alfred in his ''[[Asser|Life of King Alfred]]'':\n{{quote|Now, he was greatly loved, more than all his brothers, by his father and mother\u2014indeed, by everybody\u2014with a universal and profound love, and he was always brought up in the royal court and nowhere else. ... [He] was seen to be more comely in appearance than his other brothers, and more pleasing in manner, speech and behaviour ... [and] in spite of all the demands of the present life, it has been the desire for wisdom, more than anything else, together with the nobility of his birth, which have characterized the nature of his noble mind.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=74\u201375}} }}\n\nIt is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\"{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAn excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\nAlthough he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=75}}\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Queen Ealhswith.png|thumb|A posthumous image of Ealhswith, 1220.]]\nIn 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of a Mercian nobleman, [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]]. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pp=77, 240\u201341}}\n\nThey had five or six children together including: [[Edward the Elder]] who succeeded his father as king; [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] who became Lady (ruler) of the Mercians in her own right; and [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] the [[Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]], daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita \u00c6lfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex|C\u00e6dwalla]]. In 2008, the skeleton of Queen [[Eadgyth]], granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] in Germany. It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her\u2014one of the earliest members of the English royal family.{{sfn|Bristol University staff|2010}}\n\n[[Osferth]] was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother, \"mistakenly\" according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of [[Janet Nelson]] he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=322, n. 79}}{{sfn|Nelson|1999|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n{| class = wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Name!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Birth!! style=\"width:14%;\"|Death!! style=\"width:64%;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]]||||12 June 918||Married c 886, [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]] d. 911; had issue\n|-\n|[[Edward the Elder|Edward]]||c. 874||17 July 924||Married (1) [[Ecgwynn]], (2) [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], (3) 919 [[Eadgifu of Kent|Eadgifu]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]]||||||Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]]||||16 October 922(?)|| Married and had issue\n|-\n|[[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]]||||929||Married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] d. 918; had issue\n|}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Four years after his death he was moved to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (perhaps built especially to receive his body). When the New Minster moved to Hyde, a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks were transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}\n\nThe royal graves and many others were probably rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850.{{sfn|The Church Monuments Society|2014}} Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}}{{sfn|Dodson|2004|p=37}} In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.{{sfn|The Church Monuments Society|2014}}\n\nExcavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation.{{sfn|Winchester Museums Service|2009|loc=Hyde Community Archaeology Project}} The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones.

Later medieval historians, such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the [[Reformation]] Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great' rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}} The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.{{sfn|Yorke|1999}}\n\nA number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour.

However, his aptitude for [[sculpture]] led him to work for Giulio Cesare Conventi (1577\u20131640), an artist of modest talents. His two earliest known works date back to this period: two statues of saints, made of chalk, in the Oratory of Santa Maria della Vita in Bologna. By the age of twenty, [[Duke of Mantua|Ferdinando I, Duke of Mantua]], began commissioning works from him, and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After a short residence in [[Venice]], he went to Rome in 1625 with an introduction from the Duke of Mantua to the [[Pope Gregory XV|late pope's]] nephew, Cardinal [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Algardi, Alessandro|volume=1|page=598}}</ref>{{efn|These restored statues still form the core of the ''Bonacorsi-Ludovisi collection'' in [[Palazzo Altemps]]. Sculpture restoration was a common employment for even the most prominent sculptors of his day, including Bernini and [[Ercole Ferrata]].}}\n\n==Tomb of Pope Leo XI==\nPropelled by the [[Borghese]] and [[Barberini]] patronage, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his studio garnered most of the major Roman sculptural commissions. For nearly a decade, Algardi struggled for recognition. In Rome he was aided by friends that included [[Pietro da Cortona]] and his fellow Bolognese, [[Domenichino]]. His early Roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts,{{efn|His marble bust of Laudivio Zacchia, 1627, is in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin  [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image17.html (illustrated)]}} while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes. In the 1630s he worked on the tombs of the Mellini family in the [[Mellini Chapel (Santa Maria del Popolo)|Mellini Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]].\n\n[[File:Algardi Leo XI.jpg|left|thumb|''[[List of papal tombs|Tomb of Leo XI]]'' ]]\nAlgardi's first major commission came about in 1634, when Cardinal Ubaldini (Medici) contracted for a funeral monument for his great-uncle, [[Pope Leo XI]], the third of the [[Medici]] popes, who had reigned for less than a month in 1605. The monument was started in 1640, and mostly completed by 1644. The arrangement mirrors the one designed by Bernini for the Tomb of [[Urban VIII]] (1628\u201347), with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing, while at his feet, two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus. However, in Bernini's tomb, the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below, wherein the figures of ''Charity'' and ''Justice'' are either distracted by ''putti'' or lost in contemplation, while skeletal ''Death'' actively writes the epitaph. Algardi's tomb is much less dynamic. The allegorical figures of ''Magnanimity'' and ''Liberality'' have an impassive, ethereal dignity. Some have identified the helmeted figure of ''Magnanimity'' with that of [[Athena]] and iconic images of ''Wisdom''.<ref>Harriet F. Senie, \"The Tomb of Leo XI by Alessandro Algardi\", ''The Art Bulletin'' (1978); pp. 90\u201395.</ref> ''Liberality'' resembles [[Francois Duquesnoy|Duquesnoy's]] famous ''Santa Susanna'', but rendered more elegant. The tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of Urban VIII's tomb.<ref>Boucher pp. 121\u20132</ref>\n\nIn 1635\u201338, [[Pietro Boncompagni]] commissioned from Algardi a colossal statue of [[Philip Neri]] with kneeling angels for [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]], completed in 1640.<ref>Bruce Boucher, ''Earth and Fire: Italian Terracotta Sculpture from Donatello to Canova'' (Yale University Press) 2001:47.</ref> Immediately after this, Algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] with two figures: a kneeling, resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow, for the church of [[San Paolo, Bologna]]. These works established his reputation. Like Bernini's characteristic works, they often express the Baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions, yet Algardi's sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival.\n\n==Papal favour under Innocent X and Spanish commissions==\n[[File:Inoc\u00eancio X de alessandro algardi.jpg|thumb|right|''Pope Innocent X'', Capitoline Museums.]]\n\nWith the death of the Barberini [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1644 and the accession of the [[Pamphilj]] [[Pope Innocent X]], the Barberini family and fell into disrepute, resulting in fewer commissions for Bernini.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bernini: His Life and His Rome|last=Mormando|first=Francesco|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=149}}</ref> Algardi, on the other hand, was embraced by the new pope{{efn|Algardi's official 1645 portrait statue of Innocent X is preserved in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the [[Campidoglio]].}} and the pope's nephew, [[Camillo Pamphilj]].{{efn|His portrait bust of Camillo Pamphili, 1647, is at The [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image2.html illustration].}} Algardi's portraits were highly prized, and their formal severity contrasts with Bernini's more vivacious expression.{{efn|Compare the prior images with {{URL|http://www.museicapitolini.org/scripts/scheda.asp?lingua=en&id=MC1199|Bernini's Urban VIII}}}} A large hieratic bronze of Innocent X by Algardi is now to be found in the [[Musei Capitolini|Capitoline Museums]].\n\nAlgardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities. Although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa, the Villa Pamphili, now [[Villa Doria Pamphili]], outside the Porta San Pancrazio in Rome, he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect/engineer [[Girolamo Rainaldi]] and help with supervising its construction from his assistant [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]].<ref>Montagu, Jennifer. ''Alessandro Algardi'', Vol. 1, Yale, 1985, pp. 94\u20136,</ref> The casino was a showcase for the Pamphili collection of sculpture, ancient and contemporary, on which Algardi was well able to advise. In the villa grounds, Algardi and his studio executed sculpture-encrusted fountains and other garden features, where some of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs remain.\n\nIn 1650 Algardi met [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who obtained commissions for his work from [[Spain]]. As a consequence there are four chimney-pieces by Algardi in the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]], and in the gardens, the figures on the fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] are also by him. The Augustinian monastery at [[Salamanca]] contains the tomb of the Count and Countess de Monterey, another work by Algardi.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:Expuls\u00e3o de \u00e1tila.jpg|thumb|left|''Fuga d'Attila'', St. Peter's Basilica.]]\n\n==The ''Fuga d'Attila'' relief==\nAlgardi's large dramatic marble high-relief panel of Pope Leo and Attila<ref>[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/algardi/2/meeting.html ''Pope Leo and Atilla'' relief]</ref>(1646\u201353) for [[St Peter's Basilica]], and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs. There had been large marble reliefs used previously in Roman churches,{{efn|For example, Gian Lorenzo's father, [[Pietro Bernini]]'s crowded ''Assumption of the Virgin'' for [[Santa Maria Maggiore]](1606)}} but for most patrons, sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly. In this relief, the two principal figures, the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened [[Attila]], surge forward from the center into three dimensions. Only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope's defense, while all others in the background reliefs, persist in performing their respective earthly duties.\n\nThe subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout, since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes Leo, with supernatural aid, deterred the Huns from looting Rome. From a [[baroque]] standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man. No doubt part of his patron's message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies.\n\nAlgardi died in Rome within a year of completing his famous relief, which was admired by contemporaries.\n\nIn his later years Algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune. Algardi's classicizing manner was carried on by pupils (including [[Ercole Ferrata]] and [[Domenico Guidi]]). [[Antonio Raggi]] initially trained with him. The latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the ''Vision of Saint Nicholas'' ([[San Nicola da Tolentino, Rome]]) using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place, yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres. Other lesser known assistants from his studio include [[Francesco Barrata]], [[Girolamo Lucenti]], and [[Giuseppe Peroni]].\n\n==Critical assessment and legacy==\n\nAlgardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing [[physiognomy]] in a sober but immediate [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]], and minute attention to costume and draperies, such as in the busts of [[Laudivio Zacchia]], Camillo Pamphilj, and of Muzio Frangipane and his two sons Lello and Roberto.<ref>[http://www.romeartlover.it/Algardi.html Busts of Algardi's children]</ref>\n\nIn temperament, his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of [[Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy|Duquesnoy]] than to the emotive works of other baroque artists. From an artistic point of view, he was most successful in portrait-statues and groups of children, where he was obliged to follow nature most closely.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His terracotta models, some of them finished works of art, were prized by collectors. An outstanding series of terracotta models is at the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nAlessandro algardi, ritratto d'uomo 01.JPG|<center>A Gentleman</center>\nAlessandro algardi, busto di maurizio frangipane.jpg|<center>Maurizio Frangipane</center>\nAlessandro algardi, ritratto di olimpio pamphili.JPG|<center>Olimpia Pamphili</center>\nDa alessandro algardi, papa innocenzo X, met\u00e0 del 17mo secolo.JPG|<center> Pope Innocent X</center>\nCamillo Pamphili.jpg|<center>Camillo Pamphili</center>\nGasparoMolo.jpg|<center>Gasparo Molo</center>\n</gallery>\n{{Commons category|Alessandro Algardi}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |author=Jennifer Montagu |author-link=Jennifer Montagu |year=1985 |title=Alessandro Algardi |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-03173-4}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bruce Boucher |year=1998 |title=Italian Baroque Sculpture |chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Thames & Hudson, World of Art |id= |url= |authorlink=}}\n* [http://www.all-art.org/baroque/algardi1.html Alessandro Algardi in the \"History of Art\"]\n* [http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0017/T001772.asp Artnet Resource Library:] Alessandro Algardi\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060131031531/http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/a/algardi/ Web Gallery of Art:] Algardi, sculptures\n* [http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/03/20/algardi.2.t.php Roderick Conway-Morris, \"Casting light on a Baroque sculptor\"], ''International Herald Tribune'', March 20, 1999: Review of exhibition \"Algardi: The Other Face of the Baroque,\", 1999\n* [http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/objects/o453.html A landscape pen-and-ink drawing by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi, c 1650, to which Algardi has added figures of the Holy Family (Getty Museum)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231510/http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/ Images of nearly all works]\n* [http://www.romeartlover.it/Algardi.html Roberto Piperno, \"Three busts by Alessandro Algardi\"] Busts of members of the Frangipane family in S.

He had earlier (935) built his own house and a [[Sanhaja]] center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.

Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjar\u00e1ni\u00f0 \u2013 Heimasl\u00f3\u00f0 |language=is |publisher=Heimaslod.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.\n\nAmong the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period.

Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as \"nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot\". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which \"the 'civilised' live like rats in holes\" whereas \"the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being\".<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.</ref> However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]].\n[[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|left|City and harbour of Algiers, {{circa|1921}}]]\n\nIn 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]) during fighting between the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]], Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain.\n\n===Algerian War===\n[[File:1962-03-22 Algeria tense cease fire.ogv|thumb|right|The \"tense truce\" between Algerian rebels, French army and the OAS in 1962]]\nAlgiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), particularly during the [[Algerian War#Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]] when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means \"to eliminate the insurrectionists\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.\n\n===Independence===\nAlgeria achieved [[independence]] on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the \"Spring of Algier\". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.\n\n===Crisis of the 1990s===\nThe city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.\n\nOn December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in Algiers]].

Famous for its square with \u201cthe three clocks\u201d and for its \u201cmarket Triplet\u201d, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.\n* ''' [[Edge of sea]]''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau]] designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard [[Che Guevara]] (formerly the Boulevard of the [[Republic]]).\n* ''' [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]]''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Of village, Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.\n* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of the city.\n* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the heights of Algiers. These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.\n* The  '''Didouche Mourad street''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the '''Grande Post office''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the '''place Audin''', '''the Faculty of Algiers''', '''The Crowned Heart''' and '''the park of Galland'''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.\n[[File:Algiers, Algeria.jpg|thumb|Astronautical view of Algiers]]\n\n===Climate===\nAlgiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior deserts. Algiers on average receives roughly {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April.

The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]\nTwo major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.</ref> Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.</ref> This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\"/>  He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}</ref> He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}</ref>\n\nHis arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}</ref> His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.</ref> [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.</ref> His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.<ref>{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: {{quote|\"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.\"}}</ref> and early analysis<ref>{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|\"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.\"}}</ref> of the device.\n\nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's\u2014and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.<ref>{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.</ref> Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}</ref> In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.</ref> In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune<ref>{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.</ref> and Sabra,<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.</ref> Raynaud<ref>{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.</ref> showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-M\u00fcller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\n\nAlhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=691}}.</ref> His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=689}}.</ref> which he sought to avoid.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages= 80\u201385}}</ref> He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2004|pages=186, 192}}.</ref>  He followed [[Galen]] in believing that the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the [[retina]] was also involved.<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|1998|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAlhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=437}}  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657357?seq=104&Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=child&searchText=does&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dchild%2Bdoes%26amp%3Bfilter%3Diid%253A10.2307%252Fi370516#page_scan_tab_contents ''De Aspectibus'' Book Two, 3.39 p.437, via JSTOR]</ref>\n\n=== Scientific method ===\n{{quote|The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side.

Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular).

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].<ref>\n{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.</ref> This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165\u20139 &amp; 173\u20134}}.</ref> Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1992}}.</ref> with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Highfield|1997}}.</ref> Recently, [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.<ref>{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2011}}.</ref> They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}.\">{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2010}}.</ref> Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}.\"/>\n\n=== Other contributions ===\n[[File:Houghton Typ 620.47.452 - Selenographia, title.jpg|alt=Frontispiece of book showing two persons in robes, one holding a geometrical diagram, the other holding a telescope.|thumb|right|[[Hevelius]]'s ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen {{sic}} representing reason, and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] representing the senses.]] The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.</ref> He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=}}.</ref>\n\nSudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of [[experimental psychology]], for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Khaleefa|1999}}</ref> Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the \"founder of [[psychophysics]]\", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}.</ref>\n\nAlhazen offered an explanation of the [[Moon illusion]], an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|Plug|2002}}.</ref> Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it.

He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.</ref>\n\n=== Celestial physics ===\nAlhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses\u2014in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nHe also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').\n\n=== Mechanics ===\n\nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\"/> In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Astronomy}}<!-- -Anchor for a wikilink in Celestial Spheres article.

It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61</ref>}}\n\nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}.\">{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.</ref> during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34\u201341}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===\n\nIn his ''Al-Shuk\u016bk \u201bal\u0101 Batlamy\u016bs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.</ref> He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8\u201310}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}</ref>}}\n\nHaving pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\"/> In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:\n\n{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\"/>}}\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories\u2014which dominated this book\u2014holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.\n\n=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===\n\nAlhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.</ref>\n\n=== Other astronomical works ===\n\nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49\u201350}}</ref> The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref>\n\n== Mathematical works ==\n[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]\nIn [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395\u20136}}:\n{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'.

Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.}}</ref>\n\nHe developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.<ref>{{harvnb|Rottman|2000}}, Chapter 1.</ref>\n\n=== Geometry ===\n[[File:LunesOfAlhazen.svg|thumb|The lunes of Alhazen.

In his ''Analysis and Synthesis'', he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) where 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is [[Prime number|prime]], but he was not able to prove this result; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] later proved it in the 18th century.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen solved problems involving [[congruence relation|congruences]] using what is now called [[Wilson's theorem]]. In his ''Opuscula'', Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.\"/>\n\n=== Calculus ===\nAlhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163\u2013174 |year=1995 }} [165\u20139, 173\u20134]</ref>\n\n== Other works ==\n\n=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===\n\nAlhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.\n\n=== Engineering ===\n\nIn [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineering]], one account of his career as a [[civil engineer]] has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [[Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]] River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.<ref>{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459.</ref>\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nIn his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\"/> [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd \u2018ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s place'') for its geometrization of place.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. In \"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision.

As a Sunni, he may have been either a follower of the [[Ash'ari]] school,<ref>{{harvnb|Sardar|1998}}, {{harvnb|Bettany|1995|p=251}}.</ref> or a follower of the [[Mu'tazili]] school.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodgson|2006|p=53}}.</ref>\nSabra (1978) even suggested he might have been an adherent of [[Shia Islam]].<ref>{{harv|Sabra|1978a|p=54}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}\n\nAlhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.<ref>{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt.

Bianca Capello (Dallas Museum).jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Grand Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici'', by Allori, [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn 1540, after the death of his father, he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend, often referred to as his 'uncle', the mannerist painter [[Agnolo Bronzino]], whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Allori, Alessandro|volume=1|page=699|short=y}}</ref> In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: [[Andrea del Sarto]] worked with [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (as well as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]), [[Pontormo]] briefly worked under Andrea, and trained [[Bronzino]], who trained Allori. Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of [[Baroque]] styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy.\n\nFreedberg derides Allori as derivative, claiming  he illustrates \"the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art.\" The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]], was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the Baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the Counter-''Maniera'' ([[Counter-Mannerism]]) artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion.\n\nAmong his collaborators was [[Giovanni Maria Butteri]] and his main pupil was [[Giovanni Bizzelli]]. Cristoforo del Altissimo,  [[Cesare Dandini]], [[Aurelio Lomi]], John Mosnier, [[Alessandro Pieroni]], [[Giovanni Battista Vanni]], and Monanni also were his pupils.<ref>Hobbes J.R. page 5</ref> Allori was one of the artists, working under [[Vasari]], included in the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I|Studiolo of Francesco&nbsp;I]].\n\nHe was the father of the painter [[Cristofano Allori]] (1577\u20131621).\n\n==Main works==\n[[Image:Alessandro Allori 002.jpg|thumb|''Christ with Mary and Martha'', oil on wood, 125 x 118 cm<br>Kunsthistorisches Museum]]\n* ''Portrait of a Young Man'' (1561; [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]])\n* ''Christ and the Samaritan Woman'' (Altarpiece, 1575, [[Santa Maria Novella]], now Prato)\n* ''Road to Calvary''  (1604, Rome)\n* ''Dead Christ and Angels'', (Museum Fine Arts, Budapest)<ref name=\"wga\">[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/allori/alessand/ Web Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1100-1850)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* ''Portrait of Piero de M\u00e9dici'', ([[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Museum]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]])\n* ''Pearl Fishing'' (1570\u201372, Studiolo of Francesco I, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence)[https://web.archive.org/web/20030708080615/http://www.ocaiw.com/jmpopera.php?id=18012 image]\n* ''[[:Image:AlloriSusanna.jpg|Sussana and the Elders]]'' (202 \u00d7 117&nbsp;cm, [[mus\u00e9e Magnin]], [[Dijon]])\n* ''Allegory of Human Life''<ref name=\"wga\"/>\n* ''The Miracle of St. Peter Walking on Water''<ref name=\"wga\"/>\n* ''Venus and Cupid'',<ref name=\"wga\"/> ([[mus\u00e9e Fabre]], [[Montpellier]])\n\nIn 2006 the BBC foreign correspondent [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Sir Charles Wheeler]] returned an original Alessandro Allori painting to the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]].

Founded by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]], the Almoravid capital was [[Marrakesh]], a city the ruling house founded in 1062. The dynasty originated among the [[Lamtuna]] and the [[Godala|Gudala]], nomadic Berber tribes of the [[Sahara]], traversing the territory between the [[Draa River|Draa]], the [[Niger River|Niger]], and the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers.<ref>Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm ''Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids''].</ref>\n\nThe Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of [[Al-Andalus]] to the Iberian Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] armies at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900&nbsp;mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell\u2014at the height of their power\u2014when they failed to stop the [[Masmuda]]-led rebellion initiated by [[Ibn Tumart]]. As a result, their last king [[Ishaq ibn Ali]] was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the [[Almohad Caliphate]], who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and [[Al-Andalus]].\n\n==Name==\nThe term \"Almoravid\" comes from the Arabic \"al-Murabitun\" ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637\u0648\u0646}}), which is the plural form of \"al-Murabit\"\u2014literally meaning \"one who is tying\" but figuratively meaning \"one who is ready for battle at a fortress\". The term is related to the notion of [[Ribat]], a frontier monastery-fortress, through the root r-b-t ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u0628\u0637}} \"Rabat\": ''to tie to unite'' or {{lang|ar|\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}} \"Raabat\": ''to encamp'').<ref>Nehemia Levtzion, \"Abd Allah b. Yasin and the Almoravids\", in: John Ralph Willis, ''Studies in West African Islamic History'',  p. 54.</ref><ref>P. F. de Moraes Farias, \"The Almoravids: Some Questions Concerning the Character of the Movement\", ''Bulletin de l\u2019IFAN'', series B, 29: 3-4 (794-878), 1967.</ref>\n\nThe name \"Almoravid\" was tied to a school of Malikite law called \"Dar al-Murabitin\" founded in [[Sus al-Aksa]], modern day [[Morocco]], by a scholar named [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag Ibn Zallu]]. Ibn Zallu sent his student [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and Adrar (present-day [[Mauritania]]). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin, \"the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God.\" <ref>Messier, Ronald A. ''The Almoravids and the meanings of jihad'', Santa Barbara, CA. Praeger Publishers, 2010.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]<ref>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]].</ref> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in the [[Bay of Arguin]]).<ref>Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967).</ref> [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the \"persevering in the fight\" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.\n\nThe name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of Aglu (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ibn al-Zayyat|title=\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641|year=1220|page=89|authorlink=Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili|trans-title=Looking to know the men of Sufism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Qadi Ayyad|title=\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.|orig-year=12th century|pages=839\u201340|authorlink=Qadi Ayyad|trans-title=Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars}}</ref>\n\nContemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' (\"the veiled ones\", from ''litham'', [[Arabic]] for \"veil\"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a [[tagelmust]], a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of \"foreignness\" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. It was worn in remembrance of the Sanhaja's escape from Yemen disguised as women, thus making it simultaneously an indication of their faith.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957145068|title=The Almoravid and Almohad empires|last=K.,|first=Bennison, Amira|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780748646814|location=Edinburgh|pages=27|oclc=957145068}}</ref> Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Berbers of the [[Tamazgha]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]] concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in two areas: the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})</ref><ref>Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228.</ref> The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara desert]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala (or Judala), in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]].\n\nThe western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the \"[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese\" (pagan peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).<ref>Lewicki (1988), pp. 160-61; (1992), pp. 308-09.</ref> Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.\n\nAround 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]].\n\nAbdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as \"son of [[Ya Sin]]\" (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was \"re-born\" of the Holy Book.<ref>M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation \"You are one of messengers\" and the imperative duty to set people \"on the straight path\". Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence.</ref> Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].<ref name=\"shilling88\" /> (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.\n\nIbn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people.<ref name=\"shilling88\">{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}}</ref> Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as \"opposition\". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin\u2014soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids)\u2014set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.\n\n==Conquests==\n{{Campaignbox Almoravid Empire battles}}\n\n===Northern Africa===\nFrom the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern end in 1054, and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057,<ref name=\"shilling90\">Shillington, p. 90.</ref> but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a Berber tribal confederation, who followed an Islamic \"heresy\" preached by [[Salih ibn Tarif]] three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a village near [[Rommani]], [[Morocco]]. They were, however, completely conquered by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy Berber woman, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat]], who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty.<ref name=ZAR87>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 87]].</ref> Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, who was said to be from [[Kairouan]].<ref name=ZAR87/>\n\nIn 1061, Abu Bakr ibn Umar made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] as [[viceroy]], and also assigning to him his favourite wife Zaynab.  Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert. When he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} In November 1087,<ref name=ZAR89>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 89]].</ref> Abu Bakr was killed in battle - according to oral tradition by an arrow,<ref>P.

In 1062 he founded the city of [[Marrakech]]. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of [[Tlemcen]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]]) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as [[Oran]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}}\n\n===Ghana Empire and the southern wing===\nAccording to Arab tradition, the Almoravids conquered the [[Ghana Empire]] sometime around 1076 CE.<ref>Robinson, David. ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (New approaches to African History)</ref> An example of this tradition is the record of historian [[Ibn Khaldun]], who cited Shaykh Uthman, the [[Faq\u012bh|faqih]] of Ghana, writing in 1394. According to this source, the Almoravids weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjugated and absorbed by the [[Sosso Empire|Susu]], a neighboring people of the Sudan.<ref>Ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl. ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref>  Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kant\u00e9 took over the land.<ref>Nehemia Levtzion, ''Ancient Ghana and Mali'' (New York, 1973), pp. 51-2; 58-60.</ref>\n\nHowever criticism from Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources.{{sfn|Masonen|Fisher|1996}} According to Professor Timothy Insoll, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.{{sfn|Insoll|2003|p=230}}\n\nDierke Lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesn't preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that the main factor of the demise of Ghana empire owed much to the latter.{{sfn|Lange|1996|pp=122\u201359}} According to Lange, the Almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife; there the Almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation's nobility. Lange attributes the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by Almoravid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of military conversion and conquest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lange|first= Dierk|date=1996|title=The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana|journal= Der Islam|number= 73 |pp= 122-159|ref=harv}}.</ref>\n\nThis interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like Sheryl  L. Burkhalter (1992), who argued that, whatever the nature of the \"conquest\" in the south of the Sahara, the influence and success of the Almoravid movement in securing west African gold and circulating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control,.<ref>G\u00f3mez-Rivas, Camilo. ''Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids'',  p. 13.</ref>\n\nThe traditional position says that the ensuing war with the Almoravids pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]].\n\nThe Arab geographer [[Al-Zuhri]] wrote that the Almoravids ended [[Ibadi]]sm in Tadmekka in 1084 and that Abu Bakr \"arrived at the mountain of gold\" in the deep south.\nAfter the death of Abu Bakr (1087), the confederation of Berber tribes in the Sahara was divided between the descendants of Abu Bakr and his brother Yahya, and would have lost  control of Ghana.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3: From c.1050 to c.1600''</ref> Sheryl Burkhalter suggests that Abu Bakr\u2019s son Yahya was the leader of  the Almoravid expedition that conquered Ghana in 1076, and that the Almoravids would have survived the loss of Ghana and the defeat in the Maghreb by the Almohads, and would have ruled the Sahara until the end of the 12th century.<ref>Burkhalter, Sheryl L.

([[British Museum]]); the Almoravid gold dinar would set the standard of the Iberian ''[[maravedi]]''.]]\nIn 1086 [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] was invited by the Muslim ''[[taifa]]'' princes of [[Al-Andalus]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] to defend their territories from the encroachment of [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VI]], King of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. In that year, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Algeciras]], and defeated Castile at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he chose to settle in person.\n\nHe returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the ''taifa'' principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from [[Tortosa]]), detested the ''taifa'' rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major ''taifas'', with the exception of the one at [[Saragossa]]. The Almoravids were victorious at the [[Battle of Consuegra]], during which the son of [[El Cid]], Diego Rodr\u00edguez, perished. Alfonso, with some Le\u00f3nese, retreated into the castle of Consuegra, which was besieged for eight days until the Almoravids withdrew to the south.\n\nAfter friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (\"Commander of the Faithful\"), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' (\"Commander of the Muslims\"). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of Northwest Africa as far eastward as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]] and as far eastward as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and including the [[Balearic Islands]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=717-718}}\n\nIn 1108 Tamim Al Yusuf defeated the  [[Kingdom of Castile]] at the [[Battle of Ucl\u00e9s (1108)|Battle of Ucl\u00e9s]]. Yusuf did not reconquer much territory from the Christian kingdoms, except that of [[Valencia]]; but he did hinder the progress of the Christian [[Reconquista]] by uniting [[al-Andalus]]. In 1134 at the [[Battle of Fraga]] the Almoravids dynasty was victorious and even succeeded in slaying [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in the battle.\n\n==Decline==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\nThree years afterwards, under Yusuf's son and successor, [[Ali ibn Yusuf]], [[Sintra]] and [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]] were added, and he invaded Iberia again in 1119 and 1121, but the tide had turned, as the French had assisted the Aragonese to recover [[Zaragoza]].  In 1138, Ali ibn Yusuf was defeated by [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], and in the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), by [[Afonso I of Portugal]], who thereby won his crown. [[Siege of Lisbon|Lisbon was conquered]] by the Portuguese in 1147.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=718}}\n\nAccording to some scholars, Ali ibn Yusuf was a new generation of leadership that had forgotten the desert life for the comforts of the city.<ref>''North Africa, Islam and the Mediterranean World: From the Almoravids to the Algerian War'' (History & Society in the Islamic World), pg 59  By Julia Ann Clancy-Smith</ref> He was defeated by the combined action of his Christian foes in Iberia and the agitation of [[Almohads]] (the Muwahhids) in Morocco. After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in 1143, his son Tashfin ibn Ali lost ground rapidly before the Almohads. In 1146 he was killed in a fall from a precipice while attempting to escape after a defeat near [[Oran]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=718}}\n\nHis two successors were [[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]] and [[Ishaq ibn Ali]], but their reigns were short.

He was succeeded by his son [[Croesus]].<ref name=\"H46\">{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S\u00e9lincourt | 1954 | p=46}}</ref> A battle between his forces and those of [[Cyaxares]], king of [[Media (region)|Media]], was interrupted by the [[solar eclipse]] on 28 May 584 BC. After this, a truce was agreed and Alyattes married his daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia|Aryenis]] to [[Astyages]], the son of Cyaxares. The alliance preserved Lydia for another generation, during which it enjoyed its most brilliant period.<ref>{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | pp=142\u2013143}}</ref> Alyattes continued to wage a war against [[Miletus]] for many years but eventually he heeded the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and rebuilt a temple, dedicated to [[Athena]], which his soldiers had destroyed. He then made peace with Miletus.<ref>{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=143}}</ref> \n\nDates for the Mermnad kings are uncertain and are based on a computation by [[J. B. Bury]] and [[Russell Meiggs]] (1975) who estimated c.687\u2013c.652 BC for the reign of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]].<ref>{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Herodotus gave reign lengths for Gyges' successors,<ref name=\"H46\">{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S\u00e9lincourt | 1954 | p=46}}</ref> but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between 652 (probable death of Gyges, fighting the [[Cimmerians]]) and 547/546 (fall of [[Sardis]] to [[Cyrus the Great]]). Bury and Meiggs concluded that Ardys and Sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the 7th century BC,<ref>{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=501}}</ref> but they did not propose dates for Alyattes except their assertion that Croesus succeeded him in 560 BC. The timespan 560\u2013546 BC for the reign of Croesus is almost certainly accurate.<ref>{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=502}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\nFor several years Alyattes continued the war against the Greek colony of [[Miletus]] begun by his father [[Sadyattes]], but was obliged to turn his attention towards the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On 28 May 585 BC, during the [[Battle of Halys (585 BC)|Battle of Halys]] fought against [[Cyaxares]], king of [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Eclipse of Thales|a solar eclipse]] occurred; hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the [[Halys River]] was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAlyattes drove the [[Cimmerians]] from [[Asia Minor]],<ref name=\"H47\"/> with the help of [[war dogs]].<ref>Polyaenus, 7.2</ref> He further subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities, including [[Smyrna]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].

It was excavated by [[Spiegelthal]] in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The [[sarcophagus]] and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb. All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large [[phallus|phalli]] of stone.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{harvnb | Chisholm |1911 | p=776}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance in ''The Histories''==\nIn ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [[Herodotus]] recounts how Alyattes continued his father's war against Miletus. According to Herodotus, Sadyattes had invaded Miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of six years. The troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the Milesians could plant a new crop, which the Lydians would then burn the following year. Alyattes did the same over the next five years until the end of the war.<ref name=\"H47\">{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S\u00e9lincourt | 1954 | pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe end came about because of a Lydian fire which, driven out of control by a strong wind, destroyed the temple of [[Athene]] at [[Assesos]]. Soon afterwards, Alyattes became seriously ill and decided to asked the Delphic Oracle for advice. The priestess refused to answer his emissary until the Lydians had rebuilt the temple. Alyattes immediately sent an embassy to Miletus and agreed a peace treaty. The temple was rebuilt and Alyattes recovered his health.<ref name=\"H47\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last1=Bury | first1=J. B. | author1link=J. B.

Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was [[Consent|consensual]], and such sexual activity may be considered [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage.

It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], and [[List of countries by minimum driving age|driving age]].\n\nAge of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,<ref name=\"waites\" /> though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a [[misdemeanor]], such as ''corruption of a minor'', to what is popularly called ''[[statutory rape]]''.\n\nThere are many \"grey areas\" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between [[federal law|federal]] and [[state law|state]] laws.

In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent\"/>\n\nIn the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=CUA.edu |title=MARRIAGE CANONS from THE DECRETUM OF GRATIAN\u2014BOOK FOUR\u2014TITLE I\u2014Betrothals and Marriages\u2014C3 |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archivedate=17 January 2016 |df= }}</ref> There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage.

The phrase \"within age\" was later interpreted by jurist Sir [[Edward Coke]] (England, 17th century) as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.<ref name=\"Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia\">{{cite web|authors=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627095601/http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |archivedate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide.

Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.\n\nThe investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he \"purchased\" one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four expos\u00e9s entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental \"pleasure palaces\". The \"Maiden Tribute\" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution.

In these jurisdictions, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage, so the ''de facto'' age of consent is the marriageable age.

Examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students. For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes&nbsp;18.\n\n; Circumstances of the relationship: In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called \"estupro\" defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person.\n\n===Extraterritoriality===\n{{see also|Child sex tourism#Extraterritorial jurisdiction}}\nA growing number of countries have specific [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial legislation]] that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children.

Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an \"unequal act\" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs,<ref>UNFPA writes that \"Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men.\"[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents]</ref> and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in ''[[Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County|Michael M. v. Superior Ct.450 U.S. 464 (1981)]]'' it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because \"the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html|title=Michael M. v.

In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and, on a personal appeal to [[Pope Innocent III]], the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.\nIn 1209, ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds.  The doctrines of his followers, known as the [[Amalrician]]s, were formally condemned by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Propositions==\nAmalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Eriugena]], whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly [[pantheist]]ic form.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThree propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:\n#that God is all (''omnia sunt deus'') and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (''omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus'');\n#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;\n#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBecause of the first proposition, God himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation.\n\nThese three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], marking the ''epoch of the Father''; the second in [[Jesus Christ]], who began the ''epoch of the Son''; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the ''era of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]].''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAmalricians taught:\n*Hell is ignorance, therefore Hell is within all men, \"like a bad tooth in a mouth\";\n*God is identical with all that is, even evil belongs to God and proves God's omnipotence;\n*A man who knows that God works through everything cannot sin, because every human act is then the act of God;\n*A man who recognizes the truth that God works through everything is already in Heaven and this is the only resurrection.  There is no other life; man's fulfilment is in this life alone.\n\nDue to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Not long after the burning of ten of their members (1210), the sect itself lost its importance, while some of the surviving Amalricians became [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]].<ref>http://www.pinselpark.org/geschichte/einzel/p0375_mittelalter/r_haeresie.html (German)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Hosea Ballou]], then [[Pierre Batiffol]]<ref>{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Apocatastasis}}</ref> and [[George T.

According to [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes]]' ''Cr\u00f3nica de Portugal de 1419,'' the future Portuguese king was born in [[Guimar\u00e3es]], which was at the time the most important political center of his parents. This was accepted by most Portuguese scholarship until in 1990 Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed Coimbra, the center of the county of Coimbra and another political center of Afonso's progenitors, as his birthplace, which caused outrage in Guimar\u00e3es and a polemic between this historian and [[Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva]]. Almeida Fernandes later proposed [[Viseu]] as the birthplace of Afonso basing himself on the ''[[Chronica Gothorum]]'', which states Afonso was born in 1109, a position followed by [[Jos\u00e9 Mattoso]] in his biography of the king.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=26-27\n}}  Abel Estef\u00e2nio has suggested a different date and thesis, proposing 1106 as the birth date and the region of [[Tierra de Campos]] or even [[Sahag\u00fan]] as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts Henry and Teresa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Estef\u00e2nio|first=Abel|date=July 2010|title=A data de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/estefanio8002.html|journal=Medievalista|volume= 8|language=PT|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Estef\u00e2nio|first=Abel|date=January 2016|title=De novo a data e o local de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA19/estefanio1906.html|journal=Medievalista|volume= 19|language=PT|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe pair reigned jointly as count and countess of Portugal until Henry's death on 22 May 1112 during the siege of [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]],{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=34}} after which Teresa reigned alone.<ref name=\"Gerli\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=QlpKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA676&lpg=PA676&dq=afonso+i+of+portugal&source=bl&ots=sWxOTr0U1v&sig=HbyK45MU-hykot9JlUwI7jRwtTU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgeahUKEwi_xp_5zPvGAhUFWz4KHWWAAh8#v=onepage&q=afonso%20i%20of%20portugal&f=false Gerli, E.

Later traditions, probably started with Jo\u00e3o Soares Coelho (a bastard descendant of Egas Moniz through a female line) in the mid-13th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the ''Cr\u00f3nica de Portugal de 1419'', asserted he had been [[Egas Moniz o Aio|Egas Moniz de Ribadouro]], possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouro. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate according to Jos\u00e9 Mattoso that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz's oldest brother, [[Erm\u00edgio Moniz]], who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the \"dapifer\" and \"[[Mayor of the Palace|majordomus]]\" of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jo\u00e3o Soares Coelho e a gesta de Egas Moniz.

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archbishop of Braga]] was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]], [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez]], who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. In symmetry with his [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|cousin]] he made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral of Zamora]] in 1125, with the permission of his mother.  After the military campaign of Alfonso VII against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen.\n\n== Sole count ==\nIn 1128, near [[Guimar\u00e3es]] at the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]], Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover, Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portucale.<ref name=Gerli/> Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portucale into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county's church and nobles. The battle was mostly ignored by the Leonese [[suzerain]] who was occupied at the time with a revolt in Castille. He was also, most likely, waiting for the reaction of the Galician families. After Teresa's death in 1131, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Afonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castille]] proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin.  On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the [[writ]] in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal or Prince of the Portuguese, an act informally allowed by Afonso VII, as it was thought to be Afonso Henriques's right by blood, as one of two grandsons of the [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Emperor of Hispania]].\n\nAfonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was (possibly unanimously) proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula, although the first reference to his royal title dates from 1140. The first assembly of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] convened at [[Lamego]] (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history.\n\n== Kingship ==\n[[File:D. Afonso Henriques (Quinta da Regaleira).png|left|thumb|287x287px|19th-century depiction of King Afonso I Henriques of Portugal, on the ceiling of the Kings' Room, [[Quinta da Regaleira]], [[Sintra]], Portugal.]]\nComplete independence from Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n's [[suzerainty]], however, was not a thing he just could achieve militarily. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope]]. Afonso wed [[Mafalda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal|Mafalda of Savoy]], daughter of [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]], and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him. \n[[Image:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|339x339px|King Afonso I at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] (Oil on Canvas by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga)]]\nIn Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of [[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery]], to which he called the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]] of his uncle [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. In 1143, he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of Le\u00f3n, Afonso declared himself the direct [[wikt:liege|liege man]] of the papacy. Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]] (see [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m]]) and [[Lisbon]] in 1147 (see [[Siege of Lisbon]]).<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I.|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}}</ref> He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.\n\nMeanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], sister of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and Infanta of Aragon. Finally after winning the [[Battle of Valdevez]], the [[Treaty of Zamora (1143)]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n that Portugal was a sovereign kingdom.\n\nIn 1169 the now old Dom Afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]] by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of Le\u00f3n [[Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n|Fernando II]] also his son-in-law. From this time onward, the Portuguese king never rode a horse again, but it is not certain this was because of the disability: according to the later Portuguese chronistic tradition, this happened because Afonso would have to surrender himself again to Fernando II of Le\u00f3n or risk war between the two kingdoms if he rode a horse. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the [[Minho River]]) in the previous years.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[Image:BatalhaOurique.jpg|thumb|left|341x341px|Afonso at the [[Battle of Ourique]] witnessing the Miracle of the Cross (dated 1793 by Domigos Sequeira)]]\n\nIn 1179 the privileges and favours given to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] were compensated. With consistent effort by several parties, such as the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archpishop of Braga]] [[Paio Mendes]], in the papal court, the [[papal bull]] ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]'' was promulgated accepting the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively. In it [[Pope Alexander III]]  also acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a kingdom.\n\nIn 1184, the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] rallied a great [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] force to retaliate against the Portuguese raids done since the end of a five-year truce in 1178 and besieged [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]], which was defended by the heir [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]]. The Almohad siege failed when news arrived the archbishop of Compostela had come to the defense of the city and Fernando II of Le\u00f3n himself with his army. The Almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp, with the Almohad caliph being injured in the process (according to one version, because of a [[crossbow]] bolt) and dying on the way back to [[Seville]]. Afonso died shortly after, probably out of a sudden cause of death, on 6 December 1185. The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> There are mythical stories that it took 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge. It is also told, despite his honourable character, that he had a temper. Several chronicles give the example of a papal legate that brought a message from the [[Pope Paschal II]] refusing to acknowledge Afonso's claim as King: either after committing or saying a small offense against him or after being simply read the letter, Afonso almost killed, in his rage, the papal representative, taking several portucalense nobles and soldiers to physically restrain the young would-be king.\n\n==Scientific research==\n[[Image:AfonsoHenriques-Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Afonso Henriques in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]].]]\nIn July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal) and the [[University of Granada]] (Spain).

Afonso II - Pedro Perret 1603.png|thumb|left|200px|A 17th century depiction of Afonso.]]\nAs a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Castile]] or against the [[Moors|Moorish]] lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to ensure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.\n\nSince military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with [[private property]], civil justice, and [[Mint (coin)|minting]]. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.\n\nOther reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being [[excommunicated]] for his audacities by [[Pope Honorius III]], Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=134}} before making any serious attempts to do so.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v.

He was the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]] and his wife, [[Urraca of Castile, Queen of Portugal|Urraca of Castile]]; he succeeded his brother, King [[Sancho II of Portugal]], who died on 4 January 1248.\n\n==Early life==\nAfonso was born in [[Coimbra]].  As the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]], he was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho.\n\nHe lived mostly in France, where he married Matilda, the heiress of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], in 1238, thereby becoming [[Count of Boulogne]], [[Mortain]], [[Aumale]] and [[Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble]] ''[[jure uxoris]]''.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Marabotin \u00e0 l'effigie d'Alphonse III dit le Boulonnais.jpg|thumb|left|Afonso III of Portugal]]\n[[File:Afonso III.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of D. Afonso III as king of [[Portugal]]]]\nIn 1246, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. In 1247, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and to be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and consequently marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king and the order was not hard to enforce, he fled in exile to Toledo, Castile, where he died on 4 January 1248. Until his brother's death and his own eventual coronation, Afonso retained and used the title of ''Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino'' (Overseer, Curator and Defender of the Kingdom).\n\nIn order to ascend the throne Afonso abdicated his rights to the county of Boulogne in 1248. In 1253, he divorced Matilde in order to marry [[Beatrice of Castile (1242\u20131303)|Beatrice of Castile]], illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, King of Castile]], and [[Mayor Guill\u00e9n de Guzm\u00e1n]].\n\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of [[Leiria]], he held the first session of the ''[[Portuguese Cortes|Cortes]]'', a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all [[municipalities]]. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration.\n\nAfonso showed extraordinary vision for the time. Progressive measures taken during his kingship include: representatives of the commons, besides the nobility and clergy, were involved in governance; the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure; and fiscal innovation, such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the Church, rather than debasement of the coinage. These may have led to his excommunication by the holy see and possibly precipitated his death, and his son [[Denis of Portugal|Denis]]'s premature rise to the throne at only 18 years old.\n\nSecure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the Muslim communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the [[Algarve]] became part of the kingdom, following the capture of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\n===Final years and death===\nFollowing his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation concerning the country's borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1267)]] was signed in [[Badajoz]], determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River [[Guadiana]], as it is today.\n\nAfonso died in [[Alcoba\u00e7a (Portugal)|Alcoba\u00e7a]], [[Coimbra]] or [[Lisbon]], aged 68.\n\n==Marriages and descendants==\nAfonso's first wife was [[Matilda II, Countess of Boulogne]], daughter of [[Renaud, Count of Dammartin]], and [[Ida, Countess of Boulogne]]. They had no surviving children.  He divorced Matilda in 1253 and, in the same year, married [[Beatrice of Castile (1242\u20131303)|Beatrice of Castile]], illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, King of Castile]], and [[Mayor Guill\u00e9n de Guzm\u00e1n]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=4|'''By [[Matilda II of Boulogne]]''' ({{circa|1202}}\u20131262; married in 1239)\n|-\n|colspan=4|'''By [[Beatrice of Castile (1242\u20131303)|Beatrice of Castile]]''' (1242\u20131303; married in 1253)\n|-\n|[[Blanche of Portugal (1259\u20131321)|Blanche]]|| 25 February 1259|| 17 April 1321||Lady of [[Abbey of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas|Las Huelgas]]\n|-\n| Fernando (Ferdinand)||1260||1262||&nbsp;\n|-\n|[[Denis of Portugal|Dinis]] (Denis)|| 9 October 1261|| 7 January 1325||Succeeded him as Denis, 6th [[King of Portugal]].

The first-born of this union was Infanta [[Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile|Maria of Portugal]].\n\n==King of Portugal and Algarve==\nIn 1325 [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] entered a child-marriage with [[Constanza Manuel]] of Castile, the daughter of one of his regents. Two years later, he had the marriage annulled so he could marry Afonso's daughter, Maria of Portugal. Maria became Queen of Castile in 1328 upon her marriage to Alfonso XI, who soon became involved publicly with a mistress.<ref name=Adam/> Constanza was imprisoned in a castle in Toro while her father, [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]], waged war against Alfonso XI until 1329. Eventually, the two reached a peaceful accord after mediation by Juan del Campo, Bishop of Oviedo; this secured Constance's release from prison.\n\nThe public humiliation of his daughter led Afonso IV to have his son and heir, [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter]], marry the no less aggrieved Castilian infanta, Constanza. Afonso subsequently started a war against Castile,<ref name=Adam/> peace arriving four years later, through the intervention of the Infanta Maria herself. A year after the peace treaty was signed in [[Seville]], Portuguese troops played an important role in defeating the [[Moors]] at the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] in October 1340.\n\n== Later life ==\n[[Image:In\u00e8s de Castro se jetant avec ses enfants aux pieds d'Alphonse IV roi.jpg|left|300px|thumb|In\u00eas on her knees in front of King Afonso]]\nPolitical intrigue marked the last part of Afonso IV's reign, although Castille was torn by civil war after Alfonso XI died. [[Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]] challenged the new King [[Pedro of Castile]], who sent many Castilian [[nobility|nobles]] into exile in Portugal. Afonso's heir, [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro]], fell in love with his new wife's lady-in-waiting, [[In\u00eas de Castro]]. In\u00eas was the daughter of an important noble family from [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], with links (albeit illegitimate) to both the royal houses of Castile and Portugal. Her brothers were aligned with the Trastamara faction, and became favorites of crown prince Pedro, much to the dismay of others at the Portuguese court, who considered them Castilian upstarts. When [[Constance of Pe\u00f1afiel]] died weeks after giving birth to their third child, Pedro began living openly with In\u00eas, recognized all her children as his and repudiated the idea of marrying anyone other than In\u00eas herself. His father refused to go to war again against Castile, hoping his heir's infatuation would end, and tried to arrange another dynastic marriage for Pedro.\n\nThe situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. His grandson and Pedro's only legitimate son, future king [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando of Portugal]], was a sickly child, while In\u00eas' illegitimate children thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson's life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal's borders, Afonso ordered In\u00eas de Castro first imprisoned in his mother's old convent in [[Coimbra]], and then murdered in 1355. He expected his son to give in and marry a princess, but the heir became enraged upon learning of his lover's decapitation in front of their young child. Pedro put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the [[Douro]] and the [[Minho River|Minho]] rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early 1357.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso IV.|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}}</ref> Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May.\n\nAfonso IV's nickname ''the Brave'' alludes to his martial exploits. However, his most important accomplishments were the relative peace enjoyed by the country during his long reign and the support he gave to the [[Portuguese Navy]]. Afonso granted public funding to raise a proper commercial fleet and ordered the first Portuguese maritime explorations. The conflict with Pedro, and the explorations he initiated, eventually became the foundation of the Portuguese national epic, ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas]]'' by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]].\n\nThe dramatic circumstances of the relationship between father and son and In\u00eas de Castro was used as the basis for the plot of more than twenty operas and ballets, as well as the \"Nise lastimosa\" and \"Nise laureada\" (1577) by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Berm\u00fadez]], 'Reinar despues de morir' by [[Lu\u00eds V\u00e9lez de Guevara]], \"Inez de Castro\" by [[Mary Russell Mitford]], and La Reine morte (The Dead Queen) by [[Henry de Montherlant]]. The story with its tragic denouement is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas|The Lus\u00edadas]]'' by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] (canto iii, stanzas 118-135), and in Spanish, including ''Nise lastimosa'' and ''Nise laureada'' (1577) by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Berm\u00fadez]], ''Reinar despues de morir'' by [[Lu\u00eds V\u00e9lez de Guevara]], as well as a play by French playwright [[Henry de Montherlant]] called ''La Reine morte'' (''The Dead Queen''). [[Mary Russell Mitford]] also wrote a drama based on the story entitled ''Inez de Castro''. ''In\u00eas de Castro'' is a novel by [[Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro]] in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His sobriquet refers to his conquests in [[Northern Africa]].\n\nAs of 1471, Afonso V was the first king of Portugal to claim dominion over a plural \"Kingdom of the Algarves,\" instead of the singular \"Kingdom of the Algarve.\" Territories added to the Portuguese crown lands in North Africa during the 15th century came to be referred to as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve (now a region of southern Portugal), not the Kingdom of Portugal. The \"Algarves\" then were considered to be the southern Portuguese territories on both sides of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Cruzade d'Alphonse V dit l'africain.jpg|thumb|Afonse V of Portugal]]\nAfonso was born in [[Sintra]], the eldest son of King [[Edward of Portugal]] by his wife [[Leonor of Aragon (1402-1445)|Eleanor of Aragon]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=ra9BtjLRNMsC&pg=PA37 p 37] {{ISBN|9780415939188}}</ref>\n\nDuring his minority, Afonso V was placed under the regency of his mother<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso}}</ref> in accordance with a will of his late father. As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. Opposition rose and without any important ally among the Portuguese aristocracy other than [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], the illegitimate half brother of King Edward, the queen's position was untenable. In 1439, the [[Portuguese Cortes]] (assembly of the kingdom) decided to replace the queen with [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]] (Dom Pedro),<ref name=EB1911/> the young king's oldest uncle.<ref name=Gerli/>\n\nPeter's main policies were concerned with restricting the political power of the great noble houses and expanding the powers of the crown. The country prospered under his rule, but not peacefully, as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles. The count of Barcelos, a personal enemy of the Duke of Coimbra (despite being half-brothers) eventually became the king's favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power. In 1442, the king made Afonso the first [[Duke of Braganza]]. With this title and its lands, he became the most powerful man in Portugal and one of the richest men in Europe. To secure his position as regent, Peter had Afonso marry his daughter, [[Isabella of Coimbra]], in 1445.<ref name=Gerli/>\n\nBut on 9 June 1448, when the king came of age, Peter had to surrender his power to Afonso V.  The years of conspiracy by the Duke of Braganza finally came to a head. On 15 September of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. In the following year, led by what were later discovered to be false accusations, Afonso declared Peter a rebel and defeated his army in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]], in which his uncle (and father-in-law) was killed.<ref name=EB1911/> After this battle and the loss of one of Portugal's most remarkable infantes, the Duke of Braganza became the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.\n\n==Invasion of Morocco==\n{{further information|Morocco-Portugal relations}}\nAfonso V then turned his attentions to North Africa. In the reign of his grandfather [[John I of Portugal|John I]], [[Ceuta]] had been conquered from the king of [[Morocco]], and now the new king wanted to expand the conquests. The king's army conquered [[Alc\u00e1cer Ceguer]] in 1458 and [[Conquest of Arzila|Arzila]] in 1471. [[Tangiers]], on the other hand, was won and lost several times between 1460 and 1464. These achievements granted the king the nickname of ''the African'' or ''Africano''.<ref name=EB1911/> The king also supported the exploration of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] led by prince [[Henry the Navigator]] but after Henry's death in 1460, he did nothing to continue Henry's work. Administratively, Afonso V was a passive king. He chose not to pursue the revision of laws or development of commerce, preferring instead to preserve the legacy of his father Edward and grandfather [[John I of Portugal|John I]].\n\nIn 1452, [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', which granted Afonso V the right to reduce \"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\" to hereditary slavery. This was reaffirmed and extended in the [[Romanus Pontifex]] bull of 1455 (also by Nicholas V). These papal bulls came to be seen by some as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European colonialism.\n\n[[File:FraMauroDetailedMapInverted.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of the [[Fra Mauro map]] was made under a commission by Afonso V in 1457. Finished on April 24, 1459, it was sent to Portugal with a letter to [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], Afonso's uncle, encouraging further funding of exploration trips.

On December 11, 1474 King [[Henry IV of Castile]] died without a male heir, leaving from his two marriages only a daughter, [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] (1462-1530). But her paternity was questioned; it was rumored that his queen [[Joan of Portugal]] had an affair with a nobleman named [[Beltr\u00e1n de La Cueva]]. The birth of princess Joanna in 1462, openly called ''La Beltraneja'', caused the separation of her parents. She was never considered legitimate{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and, when the king was dying, no one took her as a serious contender for the crown. Her father's half-sister, the future Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], was due to inherit the crown, but Afonso V was persuaded to intervene in the succession. In 1475, he [[Pedigree collapse|married his niece]] Joanna, whom he considered the legitimate heir to the crown. He proclaimed himself King of Castile and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and prepared to defend his wife's rights.

He was initially under the regency of his mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, the [[Lu\u00eds de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor|Count of Castelo Melhor]].\n\nAfonso's reign saw the end of the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] (1640\u201368) and Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. However, the king was physically and mentally weak. In 1668, his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]] conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling and took power as regent. His French wife, Queen [[Maria Francisca of Savoy|Marie Fran\u00e7oise]], received an annulment and married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.\n\n== Early life ==\nAt the age of three, Afonso suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, also leaving him mentally unstable. His father created him 10th [[Duke of Braganza]].\n\nAfter the death of his eldest brother [[Teod\u00f3sio, Prince of Brazil]] in 1653, Afonso became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd [[Prince of Brazil]].\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:Infante D. Afonso e um pajem negro (c. 1653) - Avelar Rebelo.png|thumb|left|320px|''Portrait of Infante Afonso''; Jos\u00e9 de Avelar Rebelo, 1653.]]\nHe succeeded his father ([[Jo\u00e3o IV]]) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], was named regent in his father's will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662.  Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at [[Battle of the Lines of Elvas|Elvas]] (14 January 1659), [[Battle of Ameixial|Ameixial]] (8 June 1663) and [[Battle of Montes Claros|Montes Claros]] (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the [[House of Braganza]], on 13 February 1668 in the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].\n\n== Colonial affairs ==\nColonial affairs saw the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conquest of [[Jaffna]]patam, Portugal's last colony in [[Portuguese Ceylon]] (1658) and the cession of [[Bombay]] and [[Tangier]] to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso's sister, [[Catherine of Braganza]], who had married King [[Charles II of England]]. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] in return for uncontested control of [[Ceylon]].\n\nIn 1662, the [[Lu\u00eds de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor|Count of Castelo Melhor]] saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile her in Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.\n\n== Marriage ==\nHe married [[Marie Fran\u00e7oise of Nemours]], the daughter of the [[Duke of Savoy]] in 1666, but the marriage was short-lived. Marie Fran\u00e7oise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, Pedro, [[Duke of Beja]] (the future [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]]).\n\n== Deposition ==\n[[File:D. Afonso VI Preso em Sintra (Roque Gameiro, Quadros da Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal, 1917).png|thumb|right|King Afonso VI imprisoned in the [[Palace of Sintra]], by [[Alfredo Roque Gameiro]].]]\nThat same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of [[Terceira]] in the [[Azores]] for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at [[Sintra]] in 1683.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v.

Upon his death, Nepociano, a family member of undetermined relation, attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future Ramiro I.\n\nDuring his reign, which covered a span of 51 years, Alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle Santiago]] in the town of Compostela, which later became known as the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]].\n\nHe was the son of [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]] and the [[Basque people|Basque]] Munia.\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in [[Oviedo]] in 759 or 760. He was put under the guardianship of his aunt [[Adosinda]] after his father's death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of [[Samos]]. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda's husband [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]]. On Silo's death, he was elected king by Adosinda's allies, but the magnates raised his uncle [[Mauregatus of Asturias|Mauregatus]] to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to [[\u00c1lava]] where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo]], Alfonso's cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Burbia River]].\n\n== Alfonso proclaimed king ==\nAlfonso was subsequently elected king on September 14, 791. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage between his sister Ximena and Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son [[Bernardo del Carpio]]. Bernardo is the hero of a ''[[cantar de gesta]]'' (''chanson de geste'') written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso II.|volume=1|page=734}}</ref>\n\n== Andalusian raids into Asturias ==\nOn accession to the throne, [[Hisham I of C\u00f3rdoba|Hisham I]], son of [[Abd al-Rahman I]], commenced a string of military campaigns in the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794, a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked for the assistance of the [[Basque people|Basque]] Frankish vassal Belasco, master of [[\u00c1lava]] and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim advanced deeper west into Asturias and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.\n\n== Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy ==\nConfronted with heavy fire, Alfonso II reached out to [[Charlemagne]]'s Franks. He sent delegations to [[Toulouse]] and [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unrest\u2014\u2014troubles in Galicia\u2014\u2014and external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.\n\nAlfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint [[Martin of Tours]], and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Also during Alfonso's reign was the alleged resting-place of St. James revealed. Alfonso's envoys to Charlemagne's courts may have also dealt with the [[adoptionist]] controversy, which had brought Bermudo's kingdom into Charlemagne's view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to [[Lisbon]]. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.\n\n== Later events ==\nIn 825 he defeated Cordovan forces at [[Nar\u00f3n]] and [[Anceo]] (825) and, thanks to these victories, the \"repopulation\" of parts of [[Gallaecia|Galicia]], [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]], and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] was started\u2014charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.\n\nAlfonso also moved the capital from [[Pravia]], where Silo had located it, to [[Oviedo]], the city of his father's founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built [[San Tirso, Oviedo|San Tirso]], where he is buried, and [[San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados|Santullano]], on the outskirts.

After a [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|revolution]] deposed his mother [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] from the throne in 1868, Alfonso studied in [[Austria]] and [[France]]. His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup against the First Republic. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, and was succeeded by his unborn son, who became [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] on his birth the following year.\n\nTo date, he is the last monarch of Spain who died whilst on the throne.\n\n==Political background, early life and paternity==\n\n[[File:Alfonso XII con el duque de Sesto.jpg|left|thumb|A young Alfonso with his mentor, the [[Jos\u00e9 Osorio y Silva|Duke of Sesto]]]]\nAlfonso was born in [[Madrid]] as the eldest son of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]]. Officially, his father was her husband, [[Francis, Duke of C\u00e1diz|Infante Francis]]. Alfonso's biological paternity is uncertain: there is speculation that his biological father may have been Enrique Puigmolt\u00f3 y Mayans (a captain of the guard).<ref>Juan Sisinio P\u00e9rez Garz\u00f3n, Isabel II: Los Espejos de la Reina (2004)</ref> These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the [[Carlism|Carlists]].\n\nHis mother's accession created the second cause of instability, which was the Carlist Wars. The supporters of the [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Count of Molina]] as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas as well as the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the [[Fuero Juzgo]], the Nov\u00edsima Recopilaci\u00f3n and the [[Siete Partidas|Partidas of Alfonso X]]. This led to the third cause of instability of note, the \"Independence of the American Kingdoms\", recognized between 1823 and 1850.\n\n==A split nation==\nWhen Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Revolution of 1868]], Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the [[Theresianum]] at [[Vienna]] to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen. He assumed the name Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name \"Alfonso XI\", the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] also named [[Alfonso]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso XII.|volume=1|page=736}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Monogram of Alfonso XII of Spain.svg|thumb|right|120px|Royal Monogram]]\n\n==The Republic==\n{{Main|First Spanish Republic}}\nAfter Amadeo's abandonment in 1873, Parliament declared the Federal Republic (including Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Archipelagos), the first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the Abolition Act to Puerto Rico. Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889.\n\nBut the republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with the War in Cuba, and Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco. In the midst of the crisis during and after the First Spanish Republic, the [[Carlism|Carlist]] party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity, such as Catalonia or the Basque districts. By 1872, the [[Third Carlist War]] erupted. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the Bourbon restoration, made by some sectors of the conservatives led by Canovas del Castillo.\n\nThe Prince of Asturias, Alfonso, was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by Canovas, which led to the June 1870 abdication of Queen Isabel II in favour of her son Prince Alfonso. The new road map, which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called 'Alfonsismo', and the moderate centrist C\u00e1novas del Castillo became the spokesman. As having Alfonso in Spain would be a problem, C\u00e1novas became responsible for his education. He sent Alfonso to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in England, where the training Alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than in Spain, given the current atmosphere.\n\nOn 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration.  It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Mart\u00ednez Campos]], who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to [[Sagunto]], rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered [[Valencia]] in the king's name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo|Antonio C\u00e1novas]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.\n\n==Return from exile==\n[[File:Alfonso XII King.JPG|thumb|right|210px|Alfonso XII in the uniform of the Supreme Commander of the [[Spanish Navy]]]]\n[[File:5 Pesetas \u00e0 l'effigie d'Alphonse XII,1875.jpg|thumb|5 Peseta of Alfonso XII]]\nWithin a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]] and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the [[Carlism|Carlists]], in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]] and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nInitially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s 1923 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].  C\u00e1novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.\n\nIn order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the 'turnismo' or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of Pardo Palace (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.\n\nThis led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king.\n\nAlfonso's short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808\u20131874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas \u2013 Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain's first train was between Havana and Camag\u00fcey, and the first telegraph in Latin America was in Puerto Rico, established by [[Samuel Morse]], whose daughter lived there with her husband. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso.\n\nOn 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of [[Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha|Atocha]] in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess [[Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans|Maria de las Mercedes]], daughter of [[Antoine, Duke of Montpensier]], but she died within six months of the marriage.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Second marriage and rule==\n[[File:FOTOGRAFIA DEL REY ALFONSO XII, LA REINA M.

Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by [[cholera]] or devastated by earthquake in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party.

de Borb\u00f3n y Habsburgo-Lorena''; 17 May 1886 \u2013  28&nbsp;February 1941) was [[King of Spain]] from 1886 until the proclamation of the [[Second Republic of Spain|Second Republic]] in 1931. Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, [[Alfonso XII]], had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.\n\nDuring Alfonso's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the [[Rif War]]; [[Catalan nationalism]]. This political and social turbulence that began with the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy, which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.\n\nHe left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite between monarchy or republic. In exile, he retained his claim to the defunct throne until 1941, when he renounced his claim in favour of his third son [[Juan de Borbon|Juan]] (whose eldest son, [[Juan Carlos]], did eventually become king when the monarchy was restored) and died six weeks later. Buried in Rome, his remains were not transferred until 1980 to the Pantheon of the Kings in the monastery of [[El Escorial]].\n\n==Reign==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\n===Birth and regency===\n[[File:Alfonso XIII y Mar\u00eda Cristina Regente. 1898.

He was the posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth.  Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the Spanish prime minister on a silver tray.  Five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine.<ref>''Magnificent Monarchs'' (Fact Attack series) p.21 by [[Ian Locke]]; published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1999; {{ISBN|978-0330-374965}}</ref> The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young king in 1889 as \"the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth\".<ref>\"The Happiest Living Monarch\", ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.</ref> His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] to the United States as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nWhen he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1902/03/29/archives/alfonsos-reign-begins-may-17-he-will-take-the-oath-on-that-day.html?sq=Alfonso+XIII&scp=101&st=p \"Alfonso's Reign Begins on 17 May; He Will Take the Oath on That Day \u2013 Festivities to Last a Week,\"] ''New York Times,'' 29 March 1902.</ref> He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.\n\n===Engagement and marriage===\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|right|The nine sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]]]]\nBy 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he stayed at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[Edward VII]]. There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally,  Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.\n\nVictoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in March.\n\n[[File:Atentado en la calle Mayor..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]]\nIn May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jer\u00f3nimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jer\u00f3nimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). The wedding was marked by an assassination attempt on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[anarchist]] [[Mateu Morral]]. As  the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured several bystanders and members of the procession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/|title=Royal Wedding #1: Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg & King Alfonso XIII of Spain|work=Edwardian Promenade|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907\u20131938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.\n\nNeither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, [[Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]] (1914\u20131934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his Queen for transmitting the condition to their sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/339/1018871276.html|title=Reinas Borbones de cuidado|work=elmundo.es|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage.\n\n===World War I===\n\nDuring [[World War I]], because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral.<ref>his wife was British, his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships.</ref> The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs \u2013 transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/2018/01/royal-knight-of-charity-king-alfonso-xiii-of-spain-in-wwi/|title=\u201cRoyal Knight of Charity\u201d: King Alfonso XIII of Spain in WWI|work=loc.gov|accessdate=19 Jan 2018}}</ref> The office was located in the [[Palacio Real|Royal Palace]].\n\nAlfonso became gravely ill during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the misleading impression that Spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed \"the Spanish Flu.\"<ref name=\"Barry\">Barry 171.</ref>\n\n===Rif War and the Marquess of Estella===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09411, Primo de Rivera und der K\u00f6nig von Spanien.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alfonso (left) in 1930 with his dictatorial Prime Minister, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|The Marquess of Estella]]]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet victorious [[Rif War]] (1920\u20131926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso ''el Africano'' (\"the African\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=28088|title=Rebelion.

Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the \"Disaster of the Annual\" while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say \"Chicken meat is cheap\", before resuming his game of golf.<ref>Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284.</ref> Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the \"Disaster of the Annual\", which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the ''Cortes'' started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains.\n\nAfter the \"Disaster of the Annual\", Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in [[Malaga]] simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the Rif Republic was waved about.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> With the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the [[Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera#Military_establishes_dictatorship|military coup d'\u00e9tat later in 1923]].<ref name=\"Perry, James page 286\"/> On September 13, 1923, [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquess of Estella]], seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning ''Cortes'' report into the Annual disaster. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era.\n\n===Downfall and Second Republic===\n\n[[File:Timbre AlphonseXIII surcharge RepublEspanola.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Postage stamps featuring Alfonso XIII, such as this 1930 issue, were overprinted when the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was declared in 1931]]\n\nIn January 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, the 2nd [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Marquess of Estella]] resigned as Prime Minister. Alfonso, as the [[Marquess]]'s ally, shared the popular dislike. The King had so closely associated with the [[Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost 7 years. In April 1931, [[General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]] told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. The municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy. On 14 April, he fled the country as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate. He settled eventually in Rome.\n\nBy a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of high treason.<ref>See: [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1931/332/A01250-01250.pdf Ley aprobando el acta acusatoria contra D.

This left his third son [[Juan, Count of Barcelona]] his only male heir. Juan later was the father of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].\n\n===Civil War===\nWhen the Army rose up against the democratically elected Republican Government,<ref>Paul Preston, History of the Spanish Civil War</ref> war broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the \"Nationalist\" military rebels against the Republic. But in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General [[Francisco Franco]], declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as king. (The Nationalist army included many [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of a rival pretender.)\n\nNevertheless, he sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising. However, General [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.\n\nOn 29 September 1936, upon the death of [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]] (the Carlist pretender), Alfonso also became the senior heir of [[Hugh Capet]] and so was hailed by some French [[legitimists]] as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre.\n\n===Renunciation of claims to the throne and death===\nOn 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February of that year.\n\nIn Spain, the ''[[caudillo]]'' Franco ordered three days of national mourning.<ref>\"Mourning in Spain\", ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3.</ref>  His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].  Alfonso was buried in the Church of [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli]], the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of [[Pope Callixtus III]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/03/02/archives/italians-to-mourn-death-of-alfonso-threeday-period-is-orderedtroops.html?sq=Italians+to+Mourn+Death+of+Alfonso&scp=1&st=p \"Italians to Mourn Death of Alfonso,\"] ''The New York Times.'' 2 March 1931.</ref> In January 1980 his remains were transferred to [[El Escorial]] in Spain.<ref>\"21 Guns for Dead King's Homecoming\", ''The Times'' (21 January 1980): 4.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Palace Hotel (Madrid) 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Madrid's [[Hotel Palace]] was built on Alfonso's wishes in 1912]]\n\nAlfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges ([[Parador]]) in historic buildings of Spain.

He was the second son of King [[Sancho I of Aragon|Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] and successor of his brother [[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]]. With his marriage to [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], queen regnant of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor of Spain]], formerly employed by his father-in-law, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VI]]. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the [[Reconquista]]. He won his greatest military successes in the middle [[Ebro]], where he conquered [[Zaragoza]] in 1118 and took [[Ejea de los Caballeros|Ejea]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Calatayud]], [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], [[Tarazona]], [[Daroca]], and [[Monreal del Campo]]. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the [[Muslims]] at the [[Battle of Fraga]].\n\nHis nickname comes from the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] version of the ''[[Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]'' (c. 1370), which says that \"they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn't as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles\" (''clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas ven\u00e7i\u00f3'').<ref>Carmen Orc\u00e1stegui Gros (ed.), [https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/10/06/7orcastegui.pdf \"Cr\u00f3nica de San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a (Versi\u00f3n aragonesa)\"], ''Cuadernos de Historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita'', 51\u201352 (Zaragoza, Instituci\u00f3n \u00abFernando el Cat\u00f3lico\u00bb, 1985), p. 459.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dinero_Alfonso_I_el_Batallador_(theBattler).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A denarius minted by Alfonso in Toledo while he ruled Castile]]\nHis earliest years were passed in the [[Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa|monastery of Siresa]], learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of Lope Garc\u00e9s the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of [[Pedrola]] when Alfonso came to the throne.\n\nDuring his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the [[Battle of Alcoraz]], 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital.  He also joined [[El Cid]]'s expeditions in [[Valencia (taifa)|Valencia]].  His father gave him the lordships of [[Biel, Zaragoza|Biel]], [[Luna, Zaragoza|Luna]], [[Ardenes]], and [[Bailo, Spain|Bailo]].\n\nA series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne.  His brother's children, Isabella and Peter (who married Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, daughter of [[El Cid]]), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively.\n\n===Matrimonial conflicts===\nA passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married  (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n]], widow of [[Raymond of Burgundy]], a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role.  The marriage had been arranged by her father [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the [[Almoravides|Almoravids]], and to supply them with a capable military leader.  But Urraca was tenacious of her right as [[queen regnant]] and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war, even placing Urraca under siege at Astorga in 1112.<ref>Bernard F. Reilly, ''The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain, 1031-1157'', (Blackwell, 1995), 133-134.</ref> Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the [[Battle of Candespina]] and the [[Battle of Viadangos]], but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the Pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I., king of Aragon|volume=1|pages=734-735}}</ref> During his marriage, he had called himself \"King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Arag\u00f3n, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza\" in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]]; and his prerogative to conquer [[Andalusia]] from the Muslims.  He inserted the title of ''imperator'' on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.\n\nAlfonso's late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166\u20131234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of Muslim chiefs, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.<ref>Quoted in Lourie 1975:639 note. No bastards are recorded, though they would have cut prominent figures under the circumstances. No inference of homosexuality need be drawn: the chastity that supports fitness for the hunt or for battle is a cultural ''[[topos]]'' as old as the myth of [[Actaeon]].</ref>\n\n===Church relations===\n[[File:Arbre-Sobrarb-ANFUS-REX-ARA-GON-Alfons-I-Arag\u00f3-1104-1134.jpg|thumb|A ''[[denarius]]'' of Alfonso's, minted at [[Jaca]], bearing his effigy and the inscription ANFUS-REX ARA-GON (''Anfusus rex Aragonensium'', King Alfonso of Aragon).]]\nThe king quarrelled with the church, and particularly the [[Cistercian]]s, almost as violently as with his wife.  As he defeated her,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} so he drove [[Bernard de Sedirac|Archbishop Bernard]] into exile and expelled the monks of [[Sahag\u00fan, Spain|Sahag\u00fan]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and Le\u00f3n to his stepson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile]], son of Urraca and her first husband.  The intervention of [[Pope Calixtus II]] brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1122 in Belchite, he founded [[Confraternity of Belchite|a confraternity of knights]] to fight against the Almoravids.  It was the start of the military orders in Aragon.  Years later, he organised a branch of the ''Militia Christi'' of the [[Holy Land]] at [[Monreal del Campo]].\n\n===Military expansion===\nAlfonso spent his first four years as king in near-constant war with the Muslims.  In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol.  In 1106, he defeated [[Ahmad II al-Musta'in]] of Zaragoza at Valtierra.  In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera.  Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and Le\u00f3n through his wife, Urraca.  He resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering [[Fitero]], [[Corella, Spain|Corella]], [[Cintru\u00e9nigo]], [[Murchante]], [[Monteagudo, Navarre|Monteagudo]], and [[Cascante]].\n\nIn 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a [[crusade]] to assist in the conquest of [[Zaragoza]].  Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at [[Ayerbe]].  They took Almud\u00e9var, Gurrea de G\u00e1llego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower.  The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard.  Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital.  Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the [[Battle of Cutanda]]. He promulgated the ''fuero'' of ''tortum per tortum'', facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs.\n\n[[File:Cerit1.jpg|thumb|left|Alfonso receiving the homage of the men of the late Count [[Girard I of Roussillon]]. A miniature from the ''[[Liber feudorum Ceritaniae]]''.]]\nIn 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castell\u00f3n, Tarazona, \u00c1greda, Magall\u00f3n, Borja, Alag\u00f3n, Novillas, Mall\u00e9n, Rueda, \u00c9pila and populated the region of [[Soria]].  He began the siege of [[Calatayud]], but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza.  When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Arag\u00f3n, Ariza, and Daroca (1120).  In 1123, he besieged and took [[Lleida]], which was in the hands of the [[count of Barcelona]].  From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Pe\u00f1a Cadiella deep in Andalusia.\n\nIn the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had claims as usurper-king of Navarre.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against [[Granada]], where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]], where got only as far as Motril.  In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to [[alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]].  He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the [[Peace of T\u00e1mara]], which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.\n\nHe conquered Molina de Arag\u00f3n and populated [[Monz\u00f3n]] in 1129, before besieging [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], which had fallen again upon the Cid's death.\n\nHe went north of the Pyrenees in October 1130 to protect the [[Val d'Aran]].  Early in 1131, he besieged [[Bayonne]].  It is said he ruled \"from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.\"\n\nAt the [[Siege of Bayonne]] in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent - the [[Knights Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the Knights of the [[Holy Sepulchre]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession \u2014 Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 \u2014 and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.<ref>[[Pope Innocent II]] indeed did write Alfonso VII to just this effect, 10 June 1135 or 36 (Lourie 1995:645).</ref> Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII's ambitions to break it \u2014 and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out \u2014 instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers \u2014 an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso's hidden intent.\n\nHis final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|monastery of San Pedro]] in [[Huesca]].\n\n==Death==\n\n===Succession===\n[[File:A box (reliquary) of the bones (relics) of Alfonso the Battler.PNG|thumb|A box ([[reliquary]]) containing the bones ([[relics]]) of Alfonso the Battler, with the skull centre, facing the viewer. Photograph by Enrique Capella (May 1920).]]\nThe testament of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought.  Alfonso's only brother, [[Ramiro II of Aragon|Ramiro]], had been a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession. The step-son of the deceased king, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of [[Sancho III of Navarre]], put himself forward but garnered no local support.  The nobility of Navarre aligned behind [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], the grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro.  A convention was called at [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]] to develop a consensus, but there Peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him, yet were unwilling to accept Ramiro.  The convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently.\n\nThe choice of the Navarrese lords fell on [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], Lord of [[Monz\u00f3n]], descendant of an illegitimate son of [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III]] and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Alfonso VII to be their king. The Aragonese took Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], then betrothing their newborn daughter to [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], who was then named Ramiro's heir. \"The result of the crisis  produced by the result of Alfonso I's will was a major reorientation of the peninsula's kingdoms: the separation of Aragon and Navarre, the union of Aragon and Catalonia and \u2014 a moot point but stressed particularly by some Castilian historians \u2014 the affirmation of 'Castilian hegemony' in Spain\"<ref>Lourie 1975:636.</ref> by the rendering of homage for [[Zaragoza]] by Alfonso's eventual heir, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona.\n\n===Pseudo-Alfonso the Battler===\nSometime during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], the Battler's grandnephew, a man came forward claiming to be Alfonso the Battler. The only contemporary references to this event are two letters of Alfonso II addressed to [[Louis VII of France]]; they were carried to Louis by [[Berengar (Bishop of L\u00e9rida)|Berengar]], the [[Bishop of L\u00e9rida|Bishop of Lleida]], but are not dated.<ref>They were first published in the ''Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la France (Correspondance de Louis VII)'', XV (Paris: 1878), 2nd ed., n<sup>o</sup>. 223\u20134, pp. 71\u20132, and utitised extensively by Marcelin Defourneaux, \"Louis VII et le souverains espagnols. L'enigme du \u00abpseudo-Alphonse\u00bb\", in ''Estudios dedicados a Men\u00e9ndez Pidal'', VI (Madrid: 1956), 647\u201361. They were published again by Ubieto Arteta (1958), appendices I and II, pp. 37\u20138.</ref> According to the second of these, the pretender was then living in Louis's domains, meaning the [[Principality of Catalonia]], which was ruled by Alfonso under Louis's suzerainty. This pretender was an old man (appropriately, since the Battler had died some decades earlier) and Alfonso II expressed confidence that Louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice. The first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately, since the Bishop sojourned at the court of Louis on his way to Rome. It is known from other sources that Berengar attended the [[Third Lateran Council]] in March 1179. The letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in January 1179 at the latest.<ref>Ubieto Arteta (1958), 35, cites the evidence for Aragon's early support for Alexander III against the [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|Antipope Victor IV]]. The earliest possible date at which Berengar could have been travelling to Rome to meet Alexander is after 23 November 1165, when the latter finally took up residence in Rome.</ref> According to an annalist source for the years 1089\u20131196, the pretender was received with honour and pomp in Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca, which the Battler had conquered, but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of Barcelona in 1181.<ref>Antonio C. Floriano, \"Fragmentos de unos viejos anales (1089\u20131196). Transcripci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis paleogr\u00e1fico. Cr\u00edtica hist\u00f3rica\", ''Bolet\u00edn de la Academia de la Historia'', CXIV (1929), 153\u20134, cited in Ubieto Arteta (1958), 36:<blockquote>Vino un ferrero e dixo: \u00abyo so don Alfonso, el que pres\u00f3 a \u00c7arago\u00e7a e Cadatayut e Daroqua\u00bb; e recebido es en aquellos lugares con grant honra e con grant ponpa. E dice muchas cosas que semeiavam verdat de lo passado quel havia fecho. E era tenido por senyer e por don Alfonso. E despues fue conoscido que non era aquel, e enforc\u00e1ronlo muy desonradament devant la ciudad de Barcelona.</blockquote></ref> Modern historian [[Antonio Ubieto Arteta]] has hypothesised that the Aragonese lords of the tenencies of Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca \u2014 Pedro de Luesia, Loferrench de Luna, Pedro de Castillazuelo (lord of Calatayud), Pedro Cornel (lord of Murillo de G\u00e1llego), and the majordomo Jimeno de Artusilla, all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenencies \u2014 supported, at least initially, the pretender.<ref>Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 24, who also connects the appearance of the pretender with the economic disasters that befell Aragon in 1174.</ref> These lords also appear in the later legend of the [[Bell of Huesca]], which has no historical basis, as the victims of Ramiro II (1136). Since, historically, they were not active in the 1130s, it is possible that the historically-based legend of the pseudo-Alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the Bell of Huesca.\n\nThe earliest chronicle source for the imposture is [[Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez de Rada]], writing in the middle of the thirteenth century, who records that there were several legends then current about the death of Alfonso the Battler: some believed he perished in the [[battle of Fraga]], some that his body had never been recovered, others that he was buried in the monastery of [[Castle of Montearag\u00f3n|Montearag\u00f3n]], and still others that he had fled from Fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance. Some years later, Rodrigo writes, though he does not give a year, an impostor arose and was received by many as the Battler, though Alfonso II had him arrested and hanged. This is the earliest reference to the impostor's end.<ref>The account in ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]'' (Madrid: 1793), II, 150\u201351, quoted in Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 1:<blockquote>[Alfonsus] nam victus occiditur et si occisus inventus fuerit dubitatur.

Plants of the genus ''Amaryllis'' are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern [[Australia]] or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name \"lily\" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, ''[[Lilium]]''. In the Victorian Language of Flowers (see [[Plant symbolism]]), amaryllis means \"pride\".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Amaryllis belladonna flowers.jpg|thumb|right|''Amaryllis belladonna'' flowers]]\n''Amaryllis'' is a [[bulb]]ous plant, with each bulb being {{convert|5|-|10|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, green [[leaf|leaves]], {{convert|30|-|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|-|3|cm|abbr=on}} broad, arranged in two rows.\n\nEach bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30\u201360&nbsp;cm tall, each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel-shaped [[flower]]s at their tops. Each flower is {{convert|6|-|10|cm|abbr=on}} diameter with six [[tepal]]s (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe single genus in [[subtribe]] Amaryllidinae, in the [[Amaryllideae]] tribe. The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 [[Carl Linnaeus]] created the name ''Amaryllis belladonna'', the [[type species]] of the genus ''Amaryllis''. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, ''Amaryllis'' would be the correct name for the genus ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. [[Alan W. Meerow]] et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that ''Amaryllis'' <small>L.</small> should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African ''[[Amaryllis belladonna]]'' from the [[George Clifford III|Clifford Herbarium]] at the [[Natural History Museum]] in London.<ref>{{Citation |last=Meerow |first=Alan W. |last2=Van Scheepen |first2=Johan |last3=Dutilh |first3=Julie H.A. |year=1997 |title=Transfers from ''Amaryllis'' to ''Hippeastrum (Amaryllidaceae)'' |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201319 |jstor=1224287 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\nAmaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:\n\nThese are phylogenetically related as follows:\n\n{{clade\n| label1= Tribe '''Amaryllideae'''\n\n| 1= {{clade\n| 1= Subtribe '''Amaryllidinae'''\n| 2= {{clade\n| 1= Subtribe [[Boophoninae]]\n| 2= {{clade\n|       1= Subtribe [[Strumariinae]]\n|       2= Subtribe [[Crininae]]\n    }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n\n===Etymology ===\nThe name ''Amaryllis'' is taken from a shepherdess in [[Virgil]]'s pastoral ''[[Eclogues]]'', (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[:wikt:\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9|\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9]]}} (''{{lang|el|amarysso}}''), meaning \"to sparkle\")  and also from \"Amarella\" for the bitterness of the bulb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=amaryllis|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Amaryllis|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name}}</ref><ref>Linn\u00e9, Carl von. 1737. Hortus Cliffortianus. p. 135</ref>\n\nAlthough the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name \"amaryllis\" continues to be used differently. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as \"ready to bloom for the holidays\" belong to the allied genus ''[[Hippeastrum]]''.<ref>E.g. {{Citation |title=How to Make Your Amaryllis Bloom Again |publisher=The United States National Arboretum |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Gardens/faqs/AmaryllisBloom.html |accessdate=2011-11-28 }}</ref> The common name \"naked lady\" used for ''Amaryllis'' is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern; some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names, such as the resurrection lily (''[[Lycoris squamigera]]''). The common name \"naked lady\" comes from the plant's pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down.{{sfn|Carter|2015}}\n\n== Habitat ==\nIn areas of its native habitat with mountainous [[fynbos]] flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth.  In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually.<ref name=\"Biodiveristyexp\" /> Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight.  Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains.<ref name=\"Biodiveristyexp\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production.\n\nOne or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in [[hardiness zone|USDA zone 7]]).\n\nThe plant has a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with [[carpenter bee]]s.  It is also visited by [[Noctuidae|noctuid moths]] at night.   The relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established;<ref name=\"Biodiveristyexp\" /> however, Carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the [[Cape Peninsula]].

No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original ''Amaryllis belladonna'' and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the \"side-facing\" habit of the \"old-fashioned\" pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n''A.&nbsp;belladonna'' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Amaryllis belladonna''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=115|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Amaryllis belladonna'' has been crossed in cultivation with ''[[Crinum moorei]]'' to produce a hybrid called [[\u00d7 Amarcrinum|\u00d7&nbsp;''Amarcrinum'']],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/pbswiki/index.php/XAmarcrinum|title=Pacific Bulb Society - \u00d7Amarcrinum|work=pacificbulbsociety.org}}</ref> which has named cultivars.

He conquered the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] between his succession and 1287.\n\nHe was a son of King [[Peter III of Aragon]] and [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance]], daughter and heiress of King [[Manfred of Sicily]].\n\nSoon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the [[Balearic Islands]] into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, [[James I of Aragon]]. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, [[James II of Majorca]], and conquered both Majorca  (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the [[Kingdom of Majorca]]. He followed this with the conquest of [[Menorca]] - until then, an autonomous [[Muslim]] state ([[Man\u00fbrqa]]) within the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Menorca's national holiday.\n\nHe initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother, [[James II of Aragon]]. However, he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the [[Papal States]] France.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=595}}\n\nHis reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the [[Union of Aragon]] - the so-called \"Magna Carta of Aragon\", which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.\n\nDuring his lifetime a dynastic marriage with [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], daughter of King [[Edward I of England]], was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 26 in 1291, and was buried in the Franciscan convent in Barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in Barcelona Cathedral.\n\n[[Dante Alighieri]], in [[the Divine Comedy]], recounts that he saw Alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of [[Purgatory]] with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of [[Europe]] during the 13th century.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His reign saw the incorporation of the [[County of Urgell]], [[Duchy of Athens]], and [[Duchy of Neopatria]] into the [[Crown of Aragon]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlfonso was born in [[Naples]], the second son of [[James II of Aragon|James II]] and [[Blanche of Anjou]]. In 1314, aged 14, he married [[Teresa d'Enten\u00e7a y Cabrera]], heiress of [[Urgell]], who was the same age as him. Teresa's granduncle [[Ermengol X of Urgell]] had died childless in [[La Llitera]]; before his death, he had agreed to make Alfonso his heir, on condition that Alfonso marry Teresa, who was his nearest kin. Alfonso was at this time only the second son (and not the heir) of the king of Aragon. He and his father readily agreed to Ermengol's condition, and Alfonso married Teresa in 1314 in the Cathedral of [[Lerida]]. The teenage bridegroom is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. Alfonso and Teresa became the parents of seven children.\n\nAlfonso became heir to the throne in December 1319 after his older brother [[James of Aragon (monk)|James]] renounced his rights to become a monk. During the reign of his father, Alfonso was the procurator-general of the Crown, and in 1323\u20131324, he undertook the [[Aragonese conquest of Sardinia|conquest of Sardinia]].\n\nAlfonso's father and first wife Teresa died within a few days of each other in 1327. Teresa died in childbirth on 20 October 1327, and James II died on 2 November 1327, whereupon Alfonso became king. In 1329, he began a long war with the [[Republic of Genoa]]. The city of [[Sassari]] ahd previously surrendered to Alfonso in 1323, but rebelled three more times; its possession was contested by Genoa, which led to the protracted war.\n\nIn February 1329, Alfonso married [[Eleanor of Castile (1307-1359)|Eleanor of Castile]] (1308\u20131359), the sister of king [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. Eleanor had been briefly married to Alfonso's elder brother [[James of Aragon (monk)|James the monk]]. That marriage, which James had refused to consummate, had been annulled in 1319-20. Eleanor had thereafter retired to a convent (although she never took the veil) and had remained unmarried. By December the same year, the couple were rejoiced to become the parents of a son, Ferdinand, who was followed five years later by another son, John.\n\nEleanor earnestly sought to advance the interests of her own infant sons over those of her stepson, the ''Infante'' [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter]], who was the heir-apparent. She convinced her husband to grant very large and significant territories to her sons. on 28 December 1329, Alfonso granted his new-born son Ferdinand the Marquisate of [[Tortosa]] and the cities of [[Albarrac\u00edn]], [[Orihuela]], [[Callosa d'en Sarri\u00e0]], [[Guardamar de la Safor|Guardamar]], [[Alicante]], [[Monforte del Cid|Monforte]], [[Elda]], La Mola, [[Novelda]] and [[Aspe]].{{Sfn|Ram\u00f3n Pont|1983|pp=63\u201364}} Eleanor's younger son John, who was born five years later, was also granted several lordships when he was only a toddler: [[Elche]], [[Biel, Aragon|Biel]] and Bolsa were all bestowed upon him. These territories would be controlled by Eleanor, who had also received the city of [[Huesca]] and some other villages and castles belonging to the Aragonese crown at the time of her wedding.{{Sfn|Arco y Garay|1945|p=258}} Nor was this all. While all of the above grants had been made from among the possessions of the Aragonese crown, the King also sought to bestow estates located within the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] upon the toddler Ferdinand, but he was prevented from doing so. When the King granted Ferdinand the cities of [[X\u00e0tiva]], [[Alzira, Valencia|Alzira]], [[Sagunto]], [[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], [[Borriana, Castell\u00f3n|Burriana]] and [[Castell\u00f3n de la Plana]], all located in the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the local subjects protested, and for this reason the King decided to revoked these patents.{{Sfn|Ram\u00f3n Pont|1983|p=63\u201365}} These grants of land diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected the ''Infante'' Peter, Alfonso's son by his first wife, who however was too young to make any significant protest. However, the issue agitated the court, created a climate of resentment and divided the nobility into two camps.\n\nAlfonso died in January 1336, aged only 36. He was succeeded by [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]], his 16-year-old son from his first marriage.\n\n==Children==\n[[File:Alifonso IV d'Arag\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|upright|Artistic presentation of Alfonso IV, painted by [[Manuel Aguirre y Monsalbe]] (1822\u20131856)]]\nBy [[Teresa d'Enten\u00e7a]]:\n* Alfonso (1315\u20131317)\n* [[Constance of Aragon, Queen of Majorca|Constance]] (1318\u20131346), married in 1336 to [[James III of Majorca]].\n* [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] (1319\u20131387), successor.\n* [[James I of Urgell|James I, Count of Urgell]] (1321\u20131347), also inherited Enten\u00e7a and Antillon.\n* Elizabeth (1323\u20131327).\n* Frederick (1325-died young).\n* Sancho (1327), lived only a few days.\n\nBy [[Eleanor of Castile (1307-1359)|Eleanor of Castile]]:\n* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (1329\u20131363), Marquis of Tortosa and Lord of Albarrac\u00edn and Fraga; married [[Maria, Marchioness of Tortosa]].\n* John (1331\u20131358), Lord of Elche, Biel and Bolsa, married in 1355 to [[Isabel N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara]] (daughter of [[Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez III de Lara]]) and was killed by order of his cousin [[Pedro of Castile]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh [[Psamtik II]] in 592 BC in [[Nubia]].\n\nA revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]] in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek [[mercenaries]]; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them.

The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time.  Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor Udjahorresnet began, who was of particular importance to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Several \"heads of the fleet\" are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.\n\n[[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.<ref name=Hero/>\n\nAmasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.<ref name=\"Hero\">{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA245| year = 1737| publisher = D.

This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.<ref name=Hero/><ref name=Herodotus/>\n\nFirst, Cyrus the Great signed alliance agreements with the [[Lydia]]n King [[Croesus]] and [[Nabonidus]] the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.\n\nHerodotus also describes that just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later on leave Amasis, for reasons Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice in his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]] in 525 BC.<ref name=Herodotus/>\n\n==Egypt's wealth==\n[[File:Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, from Egypt, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, British Museum]]\nAlthough Amasis appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]], and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> For example, a temple built by him was excavated at [[Tell Nebesha]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAmasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the Greeks, and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt, he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named [[Ladice (Cyrenaean Princess)|Ladice]] daughter of King [[Battus III of Cyrene|Battus III]] and made alliances with [[Polycrates]] of Samos and [[Croesus]] of Lydia.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nUnder Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that:\n{{quote|It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II (Amasis) that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000<ref>Herodotus, (II, 177, 1)</ref>}}\n\nHis kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in [[Cyrene, Libya]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In his fourth year ({{circa|lk=no|567}} BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis.<ref>Alan B. Lloyd, 'The Late Period' in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (ed. Ian Shaw), Oxford Univ. Press 2002 paperback, pp.381-82</ref> However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus]] who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt.<ref name=\"Lloyd.(2002)p.382\">Lloyd.

He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb was never discovered, Herodotus describes it for us:\n\n{{quote|[It is] a great cloistered building of stone, decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palm-trees, and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors, and behind the doors stands the sepulchre.<ref>[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amasis.htm Amasis]</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king [[Cambyses_II | Cambyses]] conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th Saite dynasty:\n{{quote|[N]o sooner did [... Cambyses] enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his [Amasis's] body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done, he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity, such as beating it with whips, sticking it with goads, and plucking its hairs. [... A]s the body had been embalmed and would not fall to pieces under the blows, Cambyses had it burned.<ref>Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 16</ref>}}\n\n==Later reputation==\n\nFrom the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), [[Herodotus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanikos]], and [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Convivium Septem Sapientium]]''. 'In those tales Amasis was presented as a non-conventional Pharaoh, behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning, a trickster on the throne or a kind of comic Egyptian [[Solomon]]'.<ref>Ioannis M.

He was one of the most prominent figures of the early [[Renaissance]] and a knight of the [[Order of the Dragon]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn at [[Medina del Campo]], he was the son of [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] and [[Eleanor of Alburquerque]]. He represented the old line of the counts of [[Barcelona]] through the female line, and was on his father's side descended from the [[House of Trastamara]], the reigning House of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. By hereditary right he was king of [[Sicily]] and claimed the island of [[Sardinia]] for himself, though it was then in the possession of [[Genoa]]. Alfonso was also in possession of much of [[Corsica]] by the 1420s.\n\n[[File:Escudo armas Alfonso V de Arag\u00f3n en Satyrarum hecatostichon cropped.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Alphonse V of Aragon in ''Satyrarum hecatostichon'' by [[Francesco Filelfo]] (1449).]]\nIn 1421 the childless Queen [[Joanna II of Naples]] adopted and named him as heir to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and Alfonso went to [[Naples]]. Here he hired the [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]] with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant, [[Louis III of Anjou]], and his forces led by [[Muzio Attendolo]] [[Sforza]]. With Pope [[Martin V]] supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese [[antipope Benedict XIII]]. When Sforza abandoned Louis' cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, [[Gianni Caracciolo]], a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.\n\nAfter an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near [[Castel Capuano]] in Naples. Alfonso fled to [[Castel Nuovo]], but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by [[Giovanni da Cardona]] improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of [[Aversa]]. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.\n\nThe Duke of Milan, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in [[L'Aquila]], but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso destroyed [[Marseille]], a possession of Louis III.\n\n[[File:King-alfonsoVaragon2.jpg|left|thumb|Manuscript detail of Alfonso V of Aragon.]]\n\nIn late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], rapidly conquering [[Gaeta]], [[Procida]], [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] and [[Sorrento]]. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro de Aragon, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by [[Francesco Sforza]], the son of Muzio Sforza (who had met his death at L'Aquila). The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to [[Sicily]] in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of [[Gianni Caracciolo]].\n\nAn opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to [[Ren\u00e9 I of Naples|Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], Louis III's younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, [[Eugene IV]], who nominally was the feudal lord of the King of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured [[Capua]] and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by [[Biagio Assereto]]. In the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|battle of Ponza]] that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.\n\nIn Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], and their successes waned.\n\n{{Aragonese House of Trast\u00e1mara}}\n\nIn the meantime, Ren\u00e9 had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero [[Jacopo Caldora]], however, Ren\u00e9's fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture [[Aversa]], [[Salerno]], [[Benevento]], [[Manfredonia]] and [[Bitonto]]. Ren\u00e9, whose possession included now only part of the [[Abruzzi]] and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the [[Marche]].\n\nAlfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year.  After the return of Ren\u00e9 to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he also conquered Sardinia.\n\nAlfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope [[Eugene IV]] that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. He died in [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of [[Genoa]]. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]], who died shortly afterwards.\n\nHis Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother John, later king [[John II of Aragon]].  Sicily and [[Sardinia]] were also inherited by his brother.\n\nAlfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of [[Skanderbeg]], whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against [[Murad II]]. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the [[Albania]]n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise.  This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by [[Demetrio Reres]] along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.\n\n==Family==\n\nAlfonso had been betrothed to [[Maria of Castile]] (1401\u20131458; sister of [[John II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children.  Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]], who served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]].\n\nGenealogical records in the [[Occitan language|Old Occitan]] [[Chronique romane|Chronicle of Montpellier]] in ''Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier'' indicate that Alphonso's relationship with his mistress, [[Giraldona Carlino]], produced three children:<ref name=\"Kooper2006\">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey S.

He founded the Academy of [[Naples]] under [[Giovanni Pontano]], and for his entrance into the city in 1443 had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of [[Castel Nuovo]].\n[[File:NapoliMaschioAngioinoIngresso.jpg|thumb|left|The triumphal arch entrance of Castel Nuovo.]]\n\nAlfonso was particularly attracted to [[classical literature]]. He reportedly brought copies of the works of [[Livy]] and [[Julius Caesar]] on his campaigns; the poet [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli]] even claimed that Alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]' history of [[Alexander the Great]]. Although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court, Alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy Latin rhetoric.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh Chrisholm|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs09AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA736|year=1911|publisher=At the University Press|page=736}}</ref>\n\nAfter his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions.
