Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field,  or conversely an external ''time-varying'' magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an [[Electromotive force|EMF]] ([[voltage]]) in the conductor.\n\nA current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to [[Ampere's circuital law|Ampere's law]].<ref name=\"Arun\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Arun\n  | first = P. \n  | title = Electronics\n  | publisher = Alpha Sciences International Ltd.\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = \n  | pages = 73\u201377\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HsavX0cnxTcC&pg=PA73\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 1842652176}}</ref>  The advantage of using the coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current.  The magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) to produce a strong field there.<ref name=\"Arun\" />  The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced.   Conversely, a ''changing'' external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to [[Faraday's law of induction]].<ref name=\"Arun\" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA129&dq=Faradays+law    Newnes 2002, p. 129]</ref>  The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil, because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.<ref name=\"Arun\" />\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field produced by a coil can be determined by the [[right hand grip rule]].  If the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the magnetic core of a coil in the direction of [[conventional current]] through the wire, the thumb will point in the direction the [[magnetic field line]]s  pass through the coil.  The end of a magnetic core from which the field lines emerge is defined to be the North pole.\n\nThere are many different types of coils used in electric and electronic equipment.\n\n[[File:VFPt Solenoid correct2.svg|thumb|In a coil of multiple turns of wire the magnetic field of the turns adds in the center of the coil, creating a strong field.

When the [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it vibrates, moving the attached speaker cone to create sound waves. The reverse is used in a dynamic [[microphone]], where sound vibrations intercepted by something like a [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] physically transfer to a voice coil immersed in a magnetic field, and the coil's terminal ends then provide an electric analog of those vibrations.\n\n===Inductors===\n[[Image:Transmitter tank inductor.jpg|thumb|Tank inductor in a [[tuned circuit]] in a shortwave [[transmitter|radio transmitter]]]]\n{{main|Inductor}}\n[[Inductor]]s or reactors are coils which generate a magnetic field which interacts with the coil itself, to induce a back EMF which opposes changes in current through the coil. Inductors are used as [[circuit element]]s in electrical circuits, to temporarily store energy or resist changes in current. A few types:\n:*Tank coil - an inductor used in a [[tuned circuit]]\n:*[[Choke (electronics)|Choke]] - an inductor used to block high frequency AC while allowing through low frequency AC.\n:*[[Loading coil]] - an inductor used to add inductance to an antenna, to make it resonant, or to a cable to prevent distortion of signals.\n:*[[Transformer types#Variometer and variocoupler|Variometer]] - an adjustable inductor consisting of two coils in series, an outer stationary coil and a second one inside it which can be rotated so their magnetic axes are in the same direction or opposed.\n:*[[Flyback transformer]] - Although called a transformer, this is actually an inductor which serves to store energy in [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]] and horizontal deflection circuits for  [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] televisions and monitors\n:*[[Saturable reactor]] - an iron-core inductor used to control AC power by varying the saturation of the core using a DC control voltage in an auxiliary winding.\n:*[[Electrical ballast|Inductive ballast]] - an inductor used in [[gas-discharge lamp]] circuits, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, to limit the current through the lamp.\n\n===Transformers===\n[[Image:Trafo-innenleben.jpg|thumb|Transformer]]\n{{main|Transformer}}\nA transformer is a device with two or more magnetically coupled windings (or sections of a single winding). A time varying current in one coil (called the [[primary winding]]) generates a magnetic field which induces a voltage in the other coil (called the [[secondary winding]]). A few types:\n:*[[Distribution transformer]] - A transformer in an [[electric power grid]] which transforms the high voltage from the electric [[power line]] to the lower voltage used by utility customers.\n:*[[Autotransformer]] - a transformer with only one winding. Different portions of the winding, accessed with taps, act as  primary and secondary windings of the transformer.  \n:*[[Toroidal transformer]] - the core is in the shape of a [[toroid]]. This is a commonly used shape as it decreases the leakage flux, resulting in less electromagnetic interference.\n:*[[Induction coil]] or [[trembler coil]] - an early transformer which uses a vibrating interrupter mechanism to break the primary current so it can operate off of DC current. \n:**[[Ignition coil]] - an induction coil used in [[internal combustion engine]]s to create a pulse of high voltage to fire the [[spark plug]] which initiates the fuel burning.\n:*[[Balun]] - a transformer which matches a [[balanced transmission line]] to an unbalanced one.\n:*[[Bifilar coil]] - a coil wound with two parallel, closely spaced strands. If AC currents are passed through it in the same direction, the [[magnetic flux]]es will add, but if equal currents in opposite directions pass through the windings the opposite fluxes will cancel, resulting in zero flux in the core. So no voltage will be induced in a third winding on the core. These are used in instruments and in devices like [[Ground Fault Interrupter]]s. They are also used in low inductance wirewound resistors for use at RF frequencies.\n:*[[Audio transformer]] - A transformer used with [[audio signal]]s. They are used for [[impedance matching]].\n:**[[Hybrid coil]] - a specialized audio transformer with 3 windings used in [[telephony]] circuits to convert between [[two-wire circuit|two-wire]] and [[four-wire circuit]]s\n\n===Electric machines===\n\n[[Electric machine]]s such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[electric generator|generators]] have one or more windings which interact with moving magnetic fields to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy.  Often a machine will have one winding through which passes most of the power of the machine (the [[Armature (electrical engineering)| \"armature\"]]), and a second winding which provides the magnetic field of the rotating element ( the \"field winding\") which may be connected by brushes or slip rings to an external source of electric current. In an [[induction  motor]], the \"field\" winding of the rotor is energized by the slow relative motion between the rotating winding and the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator winding, which induces the necessary exciting current in the rotor. \n \n===Transducer coils===\n[[Image:Metal detecting in progress on a Time Team dig.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The sensor coil of a [[metal detector]].]]\nThese are coils used to translate time-varying magnetic fields to electric signals, and vice versa. A few types:\n:*Sensor or pickup coils - these are used to detect external time-varying magnetic fields \n:*[[Inductive sensor]] - a coil which senses when a magnet or iron object passes near it \n:*[[Recording head]] - a coil which is used to create a magnetic field to write data to a [[magnetic storage]] medium, such as [[magnetic tape]], or a [[hard disk]]. Conversely it is also used to read the data in the form of changing magnetic fields in the medium.\n:*[[Induction heating|Induction heating coil]] - an AC coil used to heat an object by inducing [[eddy current]]s in it, a process called [[induction heating]].\n:*[[Loop antenna]] - a coil which serves as a [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]], to convert radio waves to electric currents. \n:*[[Rogowski coil]] - a toroidal coil used as an AC measuring device\n:*[[Pickup (music technology)|Musical instrument pickup]] - a coil used to produce the output [[audio signal]] in an [[electric guitar]] or [[electric bass]].\n:*[[Flux-gate magnetometer|Flux gate]] - a sensor coil used in a [[magnetometer]]\n:*[[Magnetic cartridge|Magnetic phonograph cartridge]] - a sensor in a [[record player]] that uses a coil to translate vibration of a needle to an audio signal in playing vinyl [[phonograph record]]s.\n\nThere are also types of coil which don't fit into these categories.\n\n==Winding technology==\n{{main|Coil winding technology}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Querfurth, William, \"''Coil winding; a description of coil winding procedures, winding machines and associated equipment for the electronic industry''\" (2d ed.).

He became [[heir apparent]] to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland on the death of his elder brother, [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the [[Spanish Habsburg]] princess [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princess [[Henrietta Maria of France]] instead.\n\nAfter his succession, Charles quarrelled with the [[Parliament of England]], which sought to curb his [[royal prerogative]]. Charles believed in the [[divine right of kings]] and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical [[absolute monarch]]. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a [[Roman Catholic]], generated the antipathy and mistrust of [[Reformed]] groups such as the English [[Puritan]]s and Scottish [[Covenanter]]s, who thought his views were too Catholic. He supported [[high church]] [[Anglican]] ecclesiastics, such as [[Richard Montagu]] and [[William Laud]], and failed to aid [[Protestant]] forces successfully during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. His attempts to force the [[Church of Scotland]] to adopt high Anglican practices led to the [[Bishops' Wars]], strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.\n\nFrom 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the [[English Civil War]]. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a [[constitutional monarchy]], and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the [[Isle of Wight]], Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for [[high treason]] in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the [[Commonwealth of England]] was declared.

It was initially developed and released as a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|modification]] by [[Minh Le|Minh \"Gooseman\" Le]] and [[Jess Cliffe]] in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. ''Counter-Strike'' was released by Valve on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the ''Counter-Strike'' series. Several [[Video game remake|remakes]] and [[port (video gaming)|port]]s of ''Counter-Strike'' have been released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console, as well as [[OS X]] and [[Linux]]. It is commonly referred to as '''''Counter-Strike 1.6''''' to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major [[software update]] the game received.\n\nSet in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] forces and various [[terrorism|terrorist]] militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Counter-Strike screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player is standing in the terrorist starting zone of de_dust using a CV-47 ([[AK-47]]).]]\n''Counter-Strike'' is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawning]] simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.\n\nThe objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:\n:* '''Bomb defusal''': The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Hostage rescue''': The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Assassination''': One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n\nA player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as \"freeze time\") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral \"buy zones\" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.\n\nStandard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).\n\nThe scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and [[Ping (video gaming)|ping]] (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.\n\nKilled players become \"spectators\" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of [[Internet cafe]]s and [[Voice over IP]] programs such as [[TeamSpeak]] or [[Ventrilo]]). This form of cheating is known as \"ghosting.\"\n\n== Development ==\n''Counter-Strike'' itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add [[Computer game bot|bots]], while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called \"admin plugins\", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must \"spread the infection\" by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also the Superhero and mods which mix the first-person gameplay of ''Counter-Strike'' with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is also highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.\n\n=== Valve Anti-Cheat ===\n{{Main|Valve Anti-Cheat}}\n\n''Counter-Strike'' has been a target for [[cheating in online games]] since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as \"[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]\" in reference to programs or \"[[hacker (hobbyist)|hacks]]\" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.\n\nWith the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify and ban as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC. To remedy this, some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |title=Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]}}</ref> These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design. Even with private cheats however, some servers have alternative anticheats to coincide with VAC itself. This can help with detecting some cheaters, but most paid for cheats are designed to bypass these alternative server-based anticheats.\n\n== Release ==\nWhen ''Counter-Strike'' was published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]],  it was bundled with ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'' multiplayer, and the ''Wanted'', ''Half-Life: Absolute Redemption'' and ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'' mods.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" />\n\nOn March 24, 1999, [[Planet Half-Life]] opened its ''Counter-Strike'' section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of ''Counter-Strike'' was released, followed by numerous further \"beta\" releases. On April 12, 2000, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] announced that the ''Counter-Strike'' developers and Valve had teamed up. In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of ''Counter-Strike'' for [[OS X]] and [[Linux]], eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1010199179645672708|title = Counter-Strike 1.6 Beta released|date = January 28, 2013|accessdate = March 16, 2014|publisher = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130214014350/http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1010199179645672708|archivedate = February 14, 2013|deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1802838328069953132|title = Counter-Strike 1.6 update released|accessdate = March 16, 2014|date = April 1, 2013|publisher = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140316053054/http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1802838328069953132|deadurl = no|archivedate = March 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 89.20%<ref name=\"GameRankings\"/>\n| MC = 88/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name = \"GameRev\"/>\n| GSpot = 8.4/10<ref name = \"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| IGN = 8.9/10<ref name = \"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}\nUpon its retail release, ''Counter-Strike'' received highly favorable reviews.<ref name=\"IGN Review\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/23/counter-strike-2|title = Counter-Strike Review|date = November 22, 2000|accessdate = April 1, 2014|website = [[IGN]]|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121025152316/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/23/counter-strike-2 |archivedate =October 25, 2012 |deadurl =no |last = Wolfe|first = Clayton}}</ref><ref name=\"GameRankings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/429818-half-life-counter-strike/index.html |title=Half-Life: Counter-Strike |accessdate=January 21, 2011 |publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/half-life-counter-strike |title=Counter-Strike |accessdate=January 21, 2011 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821094811/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/half-life-counter-strike |deadurl=yes |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"GameRev\">{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Joe | url= http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/counter-strike | title = ''Counter-Strike'' Review | date = January 1, 2001 | accessdate = January 29, 2014 | publisher = [[Game Revolution]] }}</ref><ref name=\"GameSpot Review\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-counter-strike-review/1900-2657769/|title = Half-Life: Counter-Strike Review|accessdate = April 1, 2014|date = November 27, 2000|website = [[GameSpot]]|archivedate =April 1, 2014 |deadurl =no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140401230830/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-counter-strike-review/1900-2657769/ |last = Osborne|first = Scott}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that E-Sports Entertainment [[ESEA League]] started the first professional fantasy e-sports league in 2004 with the game ''Counter-Strike''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/05wwln_consumed.html|title=Double Fantasy |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date = February 5, 2006|last = Walker|first = Rob|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025044509/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/magazine/05wwln_consumed.html|archivedate = October 25, 2012|deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/8354-ESEAs_Fantasy_ESports_League_Opens|title=ESEA's Fantasy E-Sports League Opens |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[SK-Gaming]]|date = September 10, 2004|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210235030/http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/8354-ESEAs_Fantasy_ESports_League_Opens|archivedate = December 10, 2013|deadurl = no}}</ref> Some credit the move into professional competitive team play with prizes as a major factor in ''Counter-Strike''{{'s}} longevity and success.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameguru.in/pc/2010/10/counter-strike-success-unlimited/|title=Counter-Strike: Success Unlimited |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[GameGuru]]|date = April 10, 2010|last = Mehta|first = Prakash}}</ref>\n\nGlobal retail sales of ''Counter-Strike'' surpassed 250,000 units by July 2001,<ref name=cgwsales2>{{cite journal |title=Army of One | author=Price, Tom |issue=204 |date=July 2001 |pages=50\u201355 |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] }}</ref> and 1.5 million by December 2003.<ref name=cgwsales3>{{cite journal |title=The Creators of ''Counter-Strike'' | author=Staff |issue=233 |date=December 2003 |page=107 |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] }}</ref> In the United States alone, its retail version sold 550,000 copies and earned $15.7 million by August 2006, after its release in November 2000.

''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', a game using ''Counter-Strike's'' [[GoldSrc]] engine, was released in 2004. ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', a remake of the original ''Counter-Strike'' game, was the first in the series to use Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] and was also released in 2004, only eight months after the release of ''Counter-Strike: Condition Zero''. The next game in the ''Counter-Strike'' series to be developed primarily by Valve Corporation was ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', released for Windows, OS X, Linux, [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012.\n\nThe game also spawned multiple spin-offs in the form of arcade games developed by [[Nexon Corporation]] and targeted primarily at Asian gaming markets. Four ''Counter-Strike'' games have been developed and released by Nexon Corporation thus far, ''[[Counter-Strike Neo]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Online]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies]]'', and ''[[Counter-Strike Online 2]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of video games derived from modifications]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Counter-Strike series}}\n{{Valve Corporation}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n\n[[Category:2000 video games]]\n[[Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Counter-Strike]]\n[[Category:Esports games]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:GoldSrc engine games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer online games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Valve Corporation games]]\n[[Category:Censored video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:War video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in fiction]]", "sha1": "0nw4bx1g0v6uqztx56yforv02wb596y"}}, {"title": "Camille Pissarro", "ns": "0", "id": "7434", "revision": {"id": "865588034", "parentid": "865587872", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T21:11:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "Coldcreation", "id": "4614035"}, "comment": "/* Gallery */ not in focus", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Pissarro|the surname|Pissarro (surname)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox artist\n| name        = Camille Pissarro\n| image       = Pissarro-portrait.jpg\n| caption     = Circa 1900\n| birth_name   = Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro\n| birth_date   = {{birth date|1830|7|10|df=y}}\n| birth_place    = [[Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[Danish West Indies]] (now [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]])\n| death_date   = {{death date and age|df=yes|1903|11|13|1830|7|10}}\n| death_place  = Paris, France\n| nationality = Danish-French\n| field       = Painting\n| movement    = [[Impressionism]]<br>[[Post-Impressionism]]\n}}\n\n'''Camille Pissarro''' ({{IPA-fr|kamij pisa\u0281o|lang}}; 10 July 1830&nbsp;\u2013 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French [[Impressionist]] and [[Neo-Impressionist]] painter born on the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] (now in the [[US Virgin Islands]], but then in the [[Danish West Indies]]). His importance resides in his contributions to both [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. He later studied and worked alongside [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.\n\nIn 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the \"pivotal\" figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian [[John Rewald]] called Pissarro the \"dean of the Impressionist painters\", not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also \"by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality\".<ref name=Rewald>Rewald, John. ''Camille Pissarro'', Harry N. Abrams (1989)</ref> [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]] said \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord,\" and he was also one of [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s masters. [[Renoir]] referred to his work as \"revolutionary\", through his artistic portrayals of the \"common man\", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without \"artifice or grandeur\".\n\nPissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886. He \"acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists\" but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, including [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]].<ref name=Bade>Bade, Patrick.

He studied at the Savary Academy in [[Passy]] near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas, which he did when he was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practise drawing during breaks and after work.<ref name=Masters>''The Great Masters'', Quantum Books (2004) pp. 279\u2013319</ref>\n\nWhen Pissarro turned twenty-one, Danish artist [[Fritz Melbye]], then living on St. Thomas, inspired him to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in [[Venezuela]], where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in [[Caracas]] and [[La Guaira]]. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks. In 1855 he moved back to Paris where he began working as assistant to [[Anton Melbye]], Fritz Melbye's brother.<ref name=Gallery>''Camille Pissarro'', Art Gallery of New South Wales, (2005)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pissarro.vi/exhibition.htm|title=Exhibition|publisher=St. Thomas Synagogue|accessdate=5 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325045151/http://www.pissarro.vi/exhibition.htm|archivedate=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Life in France==\n[[File:Camille Pissarro Jalais Hill, Pontoise The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|''Jalais Hill, Pontoise'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] 1867 ]]\nIn Paris he worked as assistant to Danish painter [[Anton Melbye]]. He also studied paintings by other artists whose style impressed him: [[Courbet]], [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny]], [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]]. He also enrolled in various classes taught by masters, at schools such as [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]]. But Pissarro eventually found their teaching methods \"stifling,\" states art historian [[John Rewald]]. This prompted him to search for alternative instruction, which he requested and received from Corot.<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|11}}\n\n===Paris Salon and Corot's influence===\n\nHis initial paintings were in accord with the standards at the time to be displayed at the Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], the official body whose academic traditions dictated the kind of art that was acceptable. The Salon's annual exhibition was essentially the only marketplace for young artists to gain exposure. As a result, Pissarro worked in the traditional and prescribed manner to satisfy the tastes of its official committee.<ref name=Masters/>\n\nIn 1859 his first painting was accepted and exhibited. His other paintings during that period were influenced by [[Camille Corot]], who tutored him.<ref>[http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Pissarro Pissarro Exhibition PowerPoint with sound]</ref> He and Corot both shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature. It was by Corot that Pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors, also called \"[[plein air]]\" painting. Pissarro found Corot, along with the work of [[Gustave Courbet]], to be \"statements of pictorial truth,\" writes Rewald. He discussed their work often. [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]] was another whose work he admired, especially his \"sentimental renditions of rural life\".<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|12}}\n\n===Use of natural outdoor settings===\n[[File:Camille Pissarro 012.jpg|thumb|left|''Entr\u00e9e du village de [[:fr:Voisins (Louveciennes)|Voisins]]'' (1872). [[Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay]], Paris.]]\n\nDuring this period Pissarro began to understand and appreciate the importance of expressing on canvas the beauties of nature without adulteration.<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|12}} After a year in Paris, he therefore began to leave the city and paint scenes in the countryside to capture the daily reality of village life. He found the French countryside to be \"picturesque,\" and worthy of being painted. It was still mostly agricultural and sometimes called the \"golden age of the peasantry\".<ref name=\"Gallery\"/>{{rp|17}} Pissarro later explained the technique of painting outdoors to a student:\n\n:\"Work at the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it. Paint generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the first impression.\"<ref>Rewald, John. ''The History of Impressionism'', Harry Abrams, (1990) p. 458</ref>\n\nCorot, however, would complete his own scenic paintings back in his studio where they would often be revised to his preconceptions. Pissarro, on the other hand, preferred to finish his paintings outdoors, often at one sitting, which gave his work a more realistic feel. As a result, his art was sometimes criticised as being \"vulgar,\" because he painted what he saw: \"rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes, mounds of earth, and trees in various stages of development.\" According to one source, details such as those were equivalent to today's art showing garbage cans or beer bottles on the side of a street scene. This difference in style created disagreements between Pissarro and Corot.<ref name=Masters/>\n\n===With Monet, C\u00e9zanne, and Guillaumin===\n[[File:Road to Versailles at Louveciennes 1869 Camille Pissarro.jpg|left|thumb|In 1869 Pissarro settled in [[Louveciennes]] and would often paint the road to Versailles in various seasons.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/20599\n |title= Road to Versailles}}</ref> [[The Walters Art Museum]].]]\nIn 1859, while attending the free school, the [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]], Pissarro became friends with a number of younger artists who likewise chose to paint in the more realistic style. Among them were [[Claude Monet]], [[Armand Guillaumin]] and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. What they shared in common was their dissatisfaction with the dictates of the Salon. C\u00e9zanne's work had been mocked at the time by the others in the school, and, writes Rewald, in his later years C\u00e9zanne \"never forgot the sympathy and understanding with which Pissarro encouraged him.\"<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|16}}  As a part of the group, Pissarro was comforted from knowing he was not alone, and that others similarly struggled with their art.\n\nPissarro agreed with the group about the importance of portraying individuals in natural settings, and expressed his dislike of any artifice or grandeur in his works, despite what the Salon demanded for its exhibits. In 1863 almost all of the group's paintings were rejected by the Salon, and French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] instead decided to place their paintings in a separate exhibit hall, the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]. However, only works of Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne were included, and the separate exhibit brought a hostile response from both the officials of the Salon and the public.<ref name=Masters/>\n\nIn subsequent Salon exhibits of 1865 and 1866, Pissarro acknowledged his influences from Melbye and Corot, whom he listed as his masters in the catalogue. But in the exhibition of 1868 he no longer credited other artists as an influence, in effect declaring his independence as a painter. This was noted at the time by art critic and author [[\u00c9mile Zola]], who offered his opinion:\n\n:\"Camille Pissarro is one of the three or four true painters of this day&nbsp;... I have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure.\"<ref name=Masters/>\n[[File:Camille Pissaro et sa femme Julie Vellay en 1877 \u00e0 Pontoise.jpg|thumb|right|Camille Pissarro and his wife, Julie Vellay, 1877, [[Pontoise]]]]\nAnother writer tries to describe elements of Pissarro's style:\n:\"The brightness of his palette envelops objects in atmosphere&nbsp;... He paints the smell of the earth.\"<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|35}}\nAnd though, on orders from the hanging Committee and the [[Charles-Philippe de Chennevi\u00e8res-Pointel|Marquis de Chennevi\u00e8res]], Pissarro's paintings of [[Pontoise]] for example had been skyed, hung near the ceiling, this did not prevent [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] from noting that the qualities of his paintings had been observed by art lovers.<ref>King, Ross. ''The Judgement of Paris'', Chatto & Windus (2006). p. 230.</ref> At the age of thirty-eight, Pissarro had begun to win himself a reputation as a landscapist to rival Corot and Daubigny.\n\nIn the late 1860s or early 1870s, Pissarro became fascinated with [[Japanese prints]], which influenced his desire to experiment in new compositions. He described the art to his son [[Lucien Pissarro|Lucien]]:\n\n:\"It is marvelous. This is what I see in the art of this astonishing people&nbsp;... nothing that leaps to the eye, a calm, a grandeur, an extraordinary unity, a rather subdued radiance&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|19}}\n\n===Marriage and children===\nIn 1871 in [[Croydon]] he married his mother's maid, Julie Vellay, a vineyard grower's daughter, with whom he would later have seven children. They lived outside Paris in [[Pontoise]] and later in [[Louveciennes]], both of which places inspired many of his paintings including scenes of village life, along with rivers, woods, and people at work. He also kept in touch with the other artists of his earlier group, especially Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]].<ref name=Masters/>\n\n==The London years==\n[[File:Bath Road, London by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|''Bath Road, Chiswick'', 1897 (oil on canvas). [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford.]]\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371, having only Danish nationality and being unable to join the army, he moved his family to Norwood, then a village on the edge of London. However, his style of painting, which was a forerunner of what was later called \"Impressionism\", did not do well. He wrote to his friend, [[Theodore Duret]], that \"my painting doesn't catch on, not at all&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Masters/>\n\nPissarro met the Paris art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], in London, who became the dealer who helped sell his art for most of his life. Durand-Ruel put him in touch with [[Monet]] who was likewise in London during this period. They both viewed the work of British landscape artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], which confirmed their belief that their style of open air painting gave the truest depiction of light and atmosphere, an effect that they felt could not be achieved in the studio alone. Pissarro's paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look, with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of [[impasto]], giving more depth to the work.<ref name=Masters/>\n\n===Paintings===\nThrough the paintings Pissarro completed at this time, he records [[Sydenham]] and the Norwoods at a time when they were just recently connected by railways, but prior to the expansion of suburbia. One of the largest of these paintings is a view of ''St. Bartholomew's Church'' at Lawrie Park Avenue, commonly known as [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6493 ''The Avenue, Sydenham''], in the collection of the [[London National Gallery]]. Twelve oil paintings date from his stay in Upper Norwood and are listed and illustrated in the [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] prepared jointly by his fifth child Ludovic-Rodolphe Pissarro and [[Lionello Venturi]] and published in 1939. These paintings include ''Norwood Under the Snow'', and ''[[Lordship Lane (Dulwich)|Lordship Lane Station]]'',<ref>[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/P/pissarro/pissarro_lordship.jpg.html artchive.com] entry for Pissarro Lordship Lane</ref> views of [[The Crystal Palace]] relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], ''[[Dulwich College]]'', ''[[Sydenham Hill]]'', ''All Saints Church [[Upper Norwood]]'', and a lost painting of St. Stephen's Church.\n\nReturning to France, in 1890 Pissarro again visited England and painted some ten scenes of central London. He came back again in 1892, painting in [[Kew Gardens]] and [[Kew Green]], and also in 1897, when he produced several oils described as being of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], [[Chiswick]], but in fact all being of the nearby [[Stamford Brook]] area except for one of Bath Road, which runs from Stamford Brook along the south edge of Bedford Park.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://brentfordandchiswicklhs.org.uk/publications/the-journal/journal-6-1997/camille-pissarro-paintings-of-stamford-brook-1897/ | title=Camille Pissarro: Paintings of Stamford Brook, 1897 | author=Seaton, Shirley | journal=Brentford & Chiswick Local History Journal | year=1997 | volume=6}}</ref><ref>For more details of his British visits, see Nicholas Reed, ''Camille Pissarro at Crystal Palace'' and ''Pissarro in West London'', published by Lilburne Press.</ref>\n\n==French Impressionism==\n[[File:Camille Pissarro 023.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape at [[Pontoise]]'', 1874]]\nWhen Pissarro returned to his home in France after the war, he discovered that of the 1,500 paintings he had done over 20 years, which he was forced to leave behind when he moved to London, only 40 remained. The rest had been damaged or destroyed by the soldiers, who often used them as floor mats outside in the mud to keep their boots clean. It is assumed that many of those lost were done in the Impressionist style he was then developing, thereby \"documenting the birth of [[Impressionism]].\" Armand Silvestre, a critic, went so far as to call Pissarro \"basically the inventor of this [Impressionist] painting\"; however, Pissarro's role in the Impressionist movement was \"less that of the great man of ideas than that of the good counselor and appeaser&nbsp;...\" \"Monet&nbsp;... could be seen as the guiding force.\"<ref name=Masters/>{{rp|280, 283}}\n\nHe soon reestablished his friendships with the other Impressionist artists of his earlier group, including C\u00e9zanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir, and Degas. Pissarro now expressed his opinion to the group that he wanted an alternative to the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] so their group could display their own unique styles.\n\nTo assist in that endeavour, in 1873 he helped establish a separate collective, called the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs,\" which included fifteen artists. Pissarro created the group's first charter and became the \"pivotal\" figure in establishing and holding the group together. One writer noted that with his prematurely grey beard, the forty-three-year-old Pissarro was regarded as a \"wise elder and father figure\" by the group.<ref name=Masters/> Yet he was able to work alongside the other artists on equal terms due to his youthful temperament and creativity. Another writer said of him that \"he has unchanging spiritual youth and the look of an ancestor who remained a young man\".<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|36}}\n\n===Impressionist exhibitions that shocked the critics===\n[[File:Camille Pissarro (French, 1830-1903) Le grand noyer \u00e0 l'Hermitage.jpg|thumb|''Le grand noyer \u00e0 l'Hermitage'', 1875, - the new  manner of painting was too sketchy and looked incomplete.]]\nThe following year, in 1874, the group held their first 'Impressionist' Exhibition, which shocked and \"horrified\" the critics, who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious, historical, or mythological settings. They found fault with the Impressionist paintings on many grounds:<ref name=Masters/>\n*The subject matter was considered \"vulgar\" and \"commonplace,\" with scenes of street people going about their everyday lives. Pissarro's paintings, for instance, showed scenes of muddy, dirty, and unkempt settings;\n*The manner of painting was too sketchy and looked incomplete, especially compared to the traditional styles of the period. The use of visible and expressive brushwork by all the artists was considered an insult to the craft of traditional artists, who often spent weeks on their work. Here, the paintings were often done in one sitting and the paints were applied wet-on-wet;\n*The use of color by the Impressionists relied on new theories they developed, such as having shadows painted with the reflected light of surrounding, and often unseen, objects.\n\n===A \"revolutionary\" style===\n[[File:Camille Pissarro, Le verger (The Orchard), 1872.jpg|thumb|'' Orchard in Bloom, [[Louveciennes]]'' (1872)]]\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - The Hay Cart, Montfoucault - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''The Hay Cart, [[Lassay-les-Ch\u00e2teaux|Montfoucault]]'' (1879)]]\nPissarro showed five of his paintings, all landscapes, at the exhibit, and again [[\u00c9mile Zola]] praised his art and that of the others. In the Impressionist exhibit of 1876; however, [[art critic]] Albert Wolff complained in his review, \"Try to make M. Pissarro understand that trees are not violet, that sky is not the color of fresh butter&nbsp;...\"  Journalist and art critic [[Octave Mirbeau]] on the other hand, writes, \"Camille Pissarro has been a revolutionary through the revitalized working methods with which he has endowed painting\".<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|36}}\nAccording to Rewald, Pissarro had taken on an attitude more simple and natural than the other artists. He writes:\n\n:\"Rather than glorifying\u2014consciously or not\u2014the rugged existence of the peasants, he placed them without any 'pose' in their habitual surroundings, thus becoming an objective chronicler of one of the many facets of contemporary life.\"<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|20}}\n\nIn later years, C\u00e9zanne also recalled this period and referred to Pissarro as \"the first Impressionist\". In 1906, a few years after Pissarro's death, C\u00e9zanne, then 67 and a role model for the new generation of artists, paid Pissarro a debt of gratitude by having himself listed in an exhibition catalogue as \"Paul C\u00e9zanne, pupil of Pissarro\".<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|45}}\n\nPissarro, [[Degas]], and American impressionist [[Mary Cassatt]] planned a journal of their original prints in the late 1870s, a project that nevertheless came to nothing when Degas withdrew.{{sfn|Mathews|pp= 139, 149}}<ref name=Masters/> Art historian and the artist's great-grandson Joachim Pissarro notes that they \"professed a passionate disdain for the Salons and refused to exhibit at them.\"<ref name=Joachim/> Together they shared an \"almost militant resolution\" against the Salon, and through their later correspondences it is clear that their mutual admiration \"was based on a kinship of ethical as well as aesthetic concerns\".<ref name=Joachim/>\n\nCassatt had befriended Degas and Pissarro years earlier when she joined Pissarro's newly formed French Impressionist group and gave up opportunities to exhibit in the United States. She and Pissarro were often treated as \"two outsiders\" by the Salon since neither were French or had become French citizens. However, she was \"fired up with the cause\" of promoting Impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting \"out of solidarity with her new friends\".<ref>Roe, Sue. ''The Private Lives of the Impressionists'', HarperCollins (2006) p. 187</ref> Towards the end of the 1890s she began to distance herself from the Impressionists, avoiding Degas at times as she did not have the strength to defend herself against his \"wicked tongue\". Instead, she came to prefer the company of \"the gentle Camille Pissarro\", with whom she could speak frankly about the changing attitudes toward art.{{sfn|Mathews|pp= 190, 238\u20139}} She once described him as a teacher \"that could have taught the stones to draw correctly.\"<ref name= Masters/>\n\n==Neo-Impressionist period==\n[[File:Hay Harvest at \u00c9ragny, 1901, Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|''[[Hay Harvest at \u00c9ragny]]'', 1901, [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa]]\n[[File:Enfant t\u00e9tant sa m\u00e8re by Camille Pissarro 1882.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Enfant t\u00e9tant sa m\u00e8re'', drypoint and aquatint, 1882, 123 mm x 112 mm, [[British Museum, London|British Museum.]]]]\nBy the 1880s, Pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting to break out of what he felt was an artistic \"mire\". As a result, Pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people, which he had done in Venezuela in his youth. Degas described Pissarro's subjects as \"peasants working to make a living\".<ref name=Masters/>\n\nHowever, this period also marked the end of the Impressionist period due to Pissarro's leaving the movement. As Joachim Pissarro points out, \"Once such a die-hard Impressionist as Pissarro had turned his back on Impressionism, it was apparent that Impressionism had no chance of surviving&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|52}}\n\nIt was Pissarro's intention during this period to help \"educate the public\" by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings, without idealising their lives. [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], in 1882, referred to Pissarro's work during this period as \"revolutionary,\" in his attempt to portray the \"common man.\" Pissarro himself did not use his art to overtly preach any kind of political message, however, although his preference for painting humble subjects was intended to be seen and purchased by his upper class clientele. He also began painting with a more unified brushwork along with pure strokes of color.\n\n===Studying with Seurat and Signac===\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - La R\u00e9colte des Foins, \u00c9ragny - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''La R\u00e9colte des Foins, Eragny'' (1887)]]\nIn 1885 he met [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]],<ref>Cogniat, Raymond, ''Pissarro'', Crown (1975), p. 92. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}</ref> both of whom relied on a more \"scientific\" theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colours to create the illusion of blended colours and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as [[pointillism]]. The paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son [[Lucien Pissarro|Lucien]].\n\nAll four works were considered an \"exception\" to the eighth exhibition. Joachim Pissarro notes that virtually every reviewer who commented on Pissarro's work noted \"his extraordinary capacity to change his art, revise his position and take on new challenges.\"<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|52}} One critic writes:\n\n:\"It is difficult to speak of Camille Pissarro&nbsp;... What we have here is a fighter from way back, a master who continually grows and courageously adapts to new theories.\"<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|51}}\n\nPissarro explained the new art form as a \"phase in the logical march of Impressionism\",<ref name=Gallery/>{{rp|49}} but he was alone among the other Impressionists with this attitude, however. Joachim Pissarro states that Pissarro thereby became the \"only artist who went from Impressionism to [[Neo-Impressionism]]\".\n\nIn 1884, art dealer [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] asked Pissarro if he would take in his older brother, [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]], as a boarder in his home. Lucien Pissarro wrote that his father was impressed by Van Gogh's work and had \"foreseen the power of this artist\", who was 23 years younger. Although Van Gogh never boarded with him, Pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color, ideas which he later used in his paintings, notes Lucien.<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|43}}\n\n===Abandoning Neo-Impressionism===\n[[File:Pissarro - Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather.jpg|thumb|''[[Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather]]'', (1896), [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]]]\nPissarro eventually turned away from Neo-Impressionism, claiming its system was too artificial. He explains in a letter to a friend:\n\n:\"Having tried this theory for four years and having then abandoned it&nbsp;... I can no longer consider myself one of the neo-impressionists&nbsp;... It was impossible to be true to my sensations and consequently to render life and movement, impossible to be faithful to the effects, so random and so admirable, of nature, impossible to give an individual character to my drawing, [that] I had to give up.\"<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|41}}\n\nHowever, after reverting to his earlier style, his work became, according to Rewald, \"more subtle, his color scheme more refined, his drawing firmer&nbsp;... So it was that Pissarro approached old age with an increased mastery.\"<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|41}}\n\nBut the change also added to Pissarro's continual financial hardship which he felt until his 60s. His \"headstrong courage and a tenacity to undertake and sustain the career of an artist\", writes Joachim Pissarro, was due to his \"lack of fear of the immediate repercussions\" of his stylistic decisions. In addition, his work was strong enough to \"bolster his morale and keep him going\", he writes.<ref name=Joachim/> His Impressionist contemporaries, however, continued to view his independence as a \"mark of integrity\", and they turned to him for advice, referring to him as \"P\u00e8re Pissarro\" (father Pissarro).<ref name=Joachim/>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Camille Pissarro Two Young Peasant Women The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|''Two Young Peasant Women'' (1891 and 1892), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn his older age Pissarro suffered from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As a result of this disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.<ref name=Masters/>\n\nPissarro died in Paris on 13 November 1903 and was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].<ref name=\"collier\"/>\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Camille Pissarro, c. 1900]]\nDuring the period Pissarro exhibited his works, art critic [[Armand Silvestre]] had called Pissarro the \"most real and most naive member\" of the Impressionist group.<ref name=Kelder>Kelder, Diane. ''The Great Book of French Impressionism'', Abbeville Press (1980) pp. 127, 135</ref> His work has also been described by art historian Diane Kelder as expressing \"the same quiet dignity, sincerity, and durability that distinguished his person.\" She adds that \"no member of the group did more to mediate the internecine disputes that threatened at times to break it apart, and no one was a more diligent proselytizer of the new painting.\"<ref name=Kelder/>\n\nAccording to Pissarro's son, Lucien, his father painted regularly with [[C\u00e9zanne]] beginning in 1872. He recalls that C\u00e9zanne walked a few miles to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger C\u00e9zanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's eyes, as he admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. C\u00e9zanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord.\"<ref name=Masters/>\n\n[[Lucien Pissarro]] was taught painting by his father, and described him as a \"splendid teacher, never imposing his personality on his pupil.\"  [[Gauguin]], who also studied under him, referred to Pissarro \"as a force with which future artists would have to reckon\".<ref name=Gallery/> Art historian Diane Kelder notes that it was Pissarro who introduced Gauguin, who was then a young stockbroker studying to become an artist, to Degas and C\u00e9zanne.<ref name=Kelder/> Gauguin, near the end of his career, wrote a letter to a friend in 1902, shortly before Pissarro's death:\n\n:\"If we observe the totality of Pissarro's work, we find there, despite fluctuations, not only an extreme artistic will, never belied, but also an essentially intuitive, purebred art&nbsp;... He was one of my masters and I do not deny him.\"<ref name=Rewald/>{{rp|45}}\n\nThe American impressionist [[Mary Cassatt]], who at one point lived in Paris to study art, and joined his Impressionist group, noted that he was \"such a teacher that he could have taught the stones to draw correctly.\"<ref name= Masters/>\n\nCaribbean author and scholar [[Derek Walcott]] based his book-length poem, ''Tiepolo's Hound'' (2000), on Pissarro's life.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Doubting Thomas' -- review of Derek Walcott's Tiepolo's Hound|url = https://www.academia.edu/2184537/Doubting_Thomas_--_review_of_Derek_Walcotts_Tiepolos_Hound|accessdate = 27 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lost and found paintings===\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Self-portrait2 - Tate Britain.jpg|thumb|''[[Self-portrait]],'' 1903, [[Tate Gallery]], London]]\nDuring the early 1930s throughout Europe, Jewish owners of numerous fine art masterpieces found themselves forced to give up or sell off their collections for minimal prices due to anti-Jewish laws created by the new Nazi regime. Many Jews were forced to flee Germany. When those forced into exile owned valuables, including artwork, they were often seized by officials for personal gain. In the decades after World War II, many art masterpieces were found on display in various galleries and museums in Europe and the United States. Some, as a result of legal action, were later returned to the families of the original owners. Many of the recovered paintings were then donated to the same or other museums as a gift.<ref name=Muller>Muller, Melissa; Monika, Tatzkow. ''Lost Lives, Lost Art'', Vendome Press (2010)</ref>\n\nOne such lost piece, Pissarro's 1897 oil painting, ''Rue St. Honor\u00e9, Apres Midi, Effet de Pluie'', was discovered hanging at [[Madrid]]'s government-owned museum, the [[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]].

By the 21st century, however, his paintings were selling for millions. An auction record for the artist was set on 6 November 2007 at [[Christie's]] in New York, where a group of four paintings, ''Les Quatre Saisons'' (the Four Seasons), sold for $14,601,000 (estimate $12,000,000 \u2013 $18,000,000). In November 2009 ''Le Pont Boieldieu et la Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans, Rouen, Soleil'' sold for $7,026,500 at [[Sotheby's]] in New York.

Yet heart problems often produce no symptoms until very advanced, and many symptoms, such as palpitations and sensations of extra or missing heart beats correlate poorly with relative heart health ''vs'' disease. Hence, a history alone is rarely sufficient to diagnose a heart condition.\n\n===Auscultation===\n''[[Auscultation]]'' employs a [[stethoscope]] to more easily hear various normal and abnormal sounds, such as normal heart beat sounds and the usual heart beat sound changes associated with breathing versus [[heart murmur]]s.\n\n==Laboratory==\n\n===Blood tests===\nA variety of ''[[blood test]]s'' are available for analyzing [[cholesterol]] transport behavior, [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]], [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[triglyceride]]s, [[lipoprotein little a]], [[homocysteine]], [[C-reactive protein]], blood sugar control: fasting, after eating or averages using glycosylated albumen or hemoglobin, [[myoglobin]], [[creatine kinase]], [[troponin]], [[brain-type natriuretic peptide]], etc. to assess the evolution of [[coronary artery disease]] and evidence of existing damage.

Elektrokardiogram) monitors [[electricity|electrical]] activity of the heart, primarily as recorded from the skin surface. A 12 lead recording, recording the electrical activity in three planes, anterior, posterior, and lateral is the most commonly used form. The ECG allows observation of the heart electrical activity by visualizing waveform beat origin (typically from the sinoatrial or SA node) following down the bundle of HIS and ultimately stimulating the ventricles to contract forcing blood through the body. Much can be learned by observing the QRS morphology (named for the respective portions of the polarization/repolarization waveform of the wave, P,Q,R,S,T wave). Rhythm abnormalities can also be visualized as in slow heart rate [[bradycardia]], or fast heart rate [[tachycardia]].\n\n===Holter monitor===\nA ''[[Holter monitor]]'' records a continuous EKG rhythm pattern (rarely a full EKG) for 24&nbsp;hours or more. These monitors are used for suspected frequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer may not recognize by symptoms. They are more expensive than event monitors.\n\n===Event monitor===\nAn ''[[event monitor]]'' records short term EKG rhythm patterns, generally storing the last 2 to 5&nbsp;minutes, adding in new and discarding old data, for 1 to 2 weeks or more. There are several different types with different capabilities. When the wearer presses a button on the monitor, it quits discarding old and continues recording for a short additional period. The wearer then plays the recording, via a standard phone connection, to a center with compatible receiving and rhythm printing equipment, after which the monitor is ready to record again.  These monitors are used for suspected infrequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer does recognize by symptoms.  They are less expensive than Holter monitors.\n\n===Cardiac stress testing===\n''[[Cardiac stress testing]]'' is used to determine to assess cardiac function and to disclose evidence of exertion-related cardiac [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. [[Radionuclide test]]ing using [[thallium]] or [[technetium]] can be used to demonstrate areas of perfusion abnormalities. With a maximal stress test the level of exercise is increased until the person's heart rate will not increase any higher, despite increased exercise. A fairly accurate estimate of the target heart rate, based on extensive clinical research, can be estimated by the formula 220 beats per minute minus patient's age. This linear relation is accurate up to about age 30, after which it mildly underestimates typical maximum attainable heart rates achievable by healthy individuals. Other formulas exist, such as that by Miller (217 - (0.85 \u00d7 Age)) and others. Achieving a high enough heart rate at the end of exercise is critical to improving the sensitivity of the test to detect high grade heart artery [[stenosis]]. [[HFQRS|High frequency analysis]] of the QRS complex may be useful for detection of coronary artery disease during an exercise stress test.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gerald |first1=F |last2=Philip |first2=A |last3=Kligfield |first3=P |last4=et al |title=Exercise Standards for Testing and Training A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association |journal=American Heart Association |date=August 2013 |issue=128 |pages=873-934}}</ref>\n\n===Electrophysiology study===\nThe [[electrophysiology study]] or EP study is the end all of electrophysiological tests of the heart.  It involves a catheter with electrodes probing the endocardium, the inside of the heart, and testing the conduction pathways and electrical activity of individual areas of the heart.\n\n==Medical imaging==\n{{main|Cardiac imaging}}\nCardiac imaging techniques include [[coronary catheterization]], [[echocardiogram]], [[intravascular ultrasound]], and the [[coronary calcium scan]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cardiology]]\n* [[Reference ranges for common blood tests]]\n* [[Medical technologist]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Cardiac procedures}}\n\n[[Category:Cardiac procedures]]", "sha1": "1yg3d3wdyembgz279yvbkjo2u0b72vu"}}, {"title": "Carlo Collodi", "ns": "0", "id": "7437", "revision": {"id": "865408951", "parentid": "865405856", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T19:26:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "id": "753665"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Removing from [[Category:Male journalists]] using [[c:Help:Cat-a-lot|Cat-a-lot]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{expand Italian|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name             = Carlo Collodi\n| image            = Carlo Collodi.jpg\n| caption          = \n| birth_name       = Carlo Lorenzini\n| birth_date       = {{birth date|1826|11|24|df=y}}\n| birth_place      = [[Florence]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]\n| death_date       = {{death date and age|1890|10|26|1826|11|24|df=y}}\n| death_place      = [[Florence]], [[Kingdom of Italy]]\n| occupation       = Writer, novelist\n| nationality      = Italian\n| genre            = [[Children's literature]]<br />[[Political satire]]<br />[[Journalism]]\n| movement         = \n| website          = \n}}\n[[File:Pinocchio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pinocchio, by [[Enrico Mazzanti]] (1852\u20131910), the first illustrator (1883) of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'']]\n'''Carlo Lorenzini''', better known by the [[pen name]] '''Carlo Collodi''' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8karlo kol\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0di}}; 24 November 1826 \u2013 26 October 1890), was an [[Italians|Italian]] author, humorist,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|last=Marrone|first=Gaetana|last2=Puppa|first2=Paolo|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781579583903|location=New York|pages=485}}</ref> and journalist,<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-Collodi</ref> widely known for his [[fairy tale novel]] ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nCollodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826.

His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper ''Il Lampione'' in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854 he published his second newspaper, ''Lo scaramuccia'' (\"The Controversy\").<ref name=\"JZ\">Jack Zines. \u00abIntroduction\u00bb. In: Carlo Collordi. ''Pinnochio''. Penguin Books 2002. {{ISBN|0-14-243706-9}}</ref> Lorenzini's first publications were in his periodicals.

(Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother's hometown.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCollodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as ''Il Fanfulla''; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including ''[[Macchiette]]'' (1880), ''[[Occhi e nasi]]'' (1881), ''[[Storie allegre]]'' (1887).<ref name=\"MarronePuppa2006\">{{cite book |author1=Gaetana Marrone |author2=Paolo Puppa |title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA485 |date=26 December 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-45530-9 |pages=485\u2013}}</ref>\n\nCollodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterward so he turned to children's literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1875, for instance, he completed ''Racconti delle fate'', a translation of French fairy tales by [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote ''[[Giannettino]]'' (inspired by [[Alessandro Luigi Parravicini]]'s ''Giannetto''), the ''[[Minuzzolo]]'', and ''Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino'', a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character [[Giannettino]].<ref name=\"MarronePuppa2006\" />\n\nLorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through [[allegory]]. In 1880 he began writing ''Storia di un burattino'' (''Story of a [[Marionette]]''), also called ''Le avventure di [[Pinocchio]]'', which was published weekly in ''[[Il Giornale per i Bambini]]'', the first Italian newspaper for children.<ref name=\"MarronePuppa2006\" /> Pinocchio was adapted into [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|a 1940 film by Disney]] {{citation needed span|text=that is considered to be one of Disney's greatest.|date=August 2018}}\n\nLorenzini died in Florence in 1890.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikisource author-inline}}\n* {{commonsinline}}\n* ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080225143938/http://www.pinocchio.it/park.htm Pinocchio Park] '' Collodi Tuscany\n* ''[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22633 New York Review of Books]''\n* ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302225929/http://www.pinocchio.it/eng/fondazionecollodi/ Carlo Collodi National Foundation] '' Collodi Tuscany\n* {{Gutenberg author |id=Collodi,+Carlo | name=Carlo Collodi}}\n** [[Project Gutenberg]] e-text of ''[https://archive.is/20040422183259/http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/500 The Adventures of Pinocchio]'' (translated from the Italian by Carol Della Chiesa)\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Carlo Collodi}}\n* {{Librivox author |id=125}}\n* {{Find a Grave|9904286}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071010113905/http://www.i-rabia.com/circusA.html Carlo Collodi and Modern Politics \u2013 Any Parallels ?]\n* [http://www.ilnarratore.org/show.php?type=author&language=en&aid=41&tpl=/eng/autore.tpl.html from \"Pinocchio.

Blair; ''Abstract Algebra''; [http://www.math.niu.edu/~beachy/abstract_algebra/study_guide/63.html Definition 6.3.1]</ref> Not all real numbers are constructible and to describe those that are, algebraic techniques are usually employed. However, in order to employ those techniques, it is useful to first associate points with constructible numbers.\n\nA [[point (geometry)|point]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] is a '''constructible point''' if it is either endpoint of the given unit segment, or the point of intersection of two lines determined by previously obtained constructible points, or the intersection of such a line and a circle having a previously obtained constructible point as a center passing through another constructible point, or the intersection of two such circles.<ref name=K10>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 10}}</ref> Now, by introducing [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinates]] so that one endpoint of the given unit segment is the origin {{math|(0, 0)}} and the other at {{math|(1, 0)}}, it can be shown that the coordinates of the constructible points are constructible numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 15}}</ref>\n\nIn algebraic terms, a number is constructible [[if and only if]] it can be obtained using the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of [[square root]]s, but of no higher-order roots, from constructible numbers, which always include 0 and 1. The set of constructible numbers can be completely [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] in the language of [[field (algebra)|field theory]]: the constructible numbers form the [[quadratic closure]] of the [[rational number]]s: the smallest [[field extension]] that is closed under [[square root]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 46}}</ref>  This has the effect of transforming geometric questions about compass and straightedge constructions into [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. This transformation leads to the solutions of many famous mathematical problems, which defied centuries of attack.\n\n== Geometric definitions ==\nThe traditional approach to the subject of constructible numbers has been geometric in nature, but this is not the only approach. However, the geometric approach does provide the motivation for the algebraic definitions and is historically the way the subject developed. In presenting the material in this manner, the basic ideas are introduced [[Synthetic geometry|synthetically]] and then coordinates are introduced to transition to an algebraic setting.<ref>The other direction is represented in {{harvnb|Moise|1974}} who replaces the word \"constructible\" with the word \"surd\" throughout his discussion.</ref>\n\nLet {{mvar|O}} and {{mvar|A}} be two given distinct points in the [[plane (geometry)|Euclidean plane]]. The set of points that can be constructed with compass and straightedge starting with {{mvar|O}} and {{mvar|A}} will be denoted by {{mvar|S}} and whose elements will be called '''constructible points'''. {{mvar|O}} and {{mvar|A}} are, by definition, elements of {{mvar|S}}. To more precisely describe the elements of {{mvar|S}}, we make the following two definitions:<ref name=K10 />\n* a line segment whose endpoints are in {{mvar|S}} is called a '''constructed segment''', and\n* a circle whose center is in {{mvar|S}} and which passes through a point of {{mvar|S}} (alternatively, whose radius is the distance between some pair of distinct points of {{mvar|S}}) is called a '''constructed circle'''.\nThen, the points of {{mvar|S}}, besides {{mvar|O}} and {{mvar|A}} are:<ref name=K10 />\n* the [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] of two non-parallel constructed segments (extended if necessary),\n* the intersection points of a constructed circle and a constructed segment (extended if necessary), or\n* the intersection points of two distinct constructed circles.\n\nAs an example, the midpoint of constructed segment {{mvar|OA}} is a constructible point. To see this, note that the constructed circle {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} with center {{mvar|O}} and passing through {{mvar|A}} intersects the constructed circle {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} with center {{mvar|A}} and passing through {{mvar|O}} at the constructible points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}}. The intersection of constructed segment {{mvar|PQ}} with constructed segment {{mvar|OA}} is the desired constructed midpoint.\n\nA [[Cartesian coordinate system]] can be introduced where the point {{mvar|O}} is associated to the origin having coordinates {{math|(0, 0)}} and the point {{mvar|A}} is associated with {{math|(1, 0)}}. The points of {{mvar|S}} may now be used to link the geometry and algebra, namely, we define<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 18}}</ref>\n* a '''constructible number''' is a coordinate of a constructible point.\n\nDue to point {{mvar|A}}, 0 and 1 are constructible numbers. Let {{mvar|P}} be a point in {{mvar|S}}, that is, a constructible point. If {{mvar|P}} lies on the {{mvar|x}}-axis, then {{mvar|OP}} is a constructed segment and the first coordinate of {{mvar|P}} is, in absolute value, the length of this constructed segment. If {{mvar|P}} does not lie on the {{mvar|x}}-axis then let the foot of the perpendicular from {{mvar|P}} to the {{mvar|x}}-axis be the point {{mvar|Q}}. The point {{mvar|Q}} is a constructed point, so {{mvar|PQ}} and {{mvar|OQ}} are constructed segments. The absolute values of the coordinates of the point {{mvar|P}} are therefore lengths of constructed segments. This process is reversible,<ref>{{harvnb|Moise|1974|loc=p. 227}}</ref> so it is possible to use this device to provide an alternate characterization of constructible numbers, namely:<ref>{{harvnb|Herstein|1986|loc=p. 237}}</ref>\n* 0 is a constructible number and any non-zero real number {{mvar|r}} is a constructible number if and only if {{math|{{!}}''r''{{!}}}} is the length of a constructed segment.\n\nIf {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are the non-zero lengths of constructed segments then elementary compass and straightedge constructions can be used to obtain constructed segments of lengths {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''b''}} (if {{math|''a'' \u2265 ''b''}}), {{math|''ab''}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. The latter two can be done with a construction based on the [[intercept theorem]].

More precisely, {{math|''z''}} is constructible if and only if there exists a tower of complex fields\n\n<math>\\mathbb{Q}(i) = F_0 \\subseteq F_1 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq F_n,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''z''}} is in {{math|''F''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and for all {{math|0 \u2264 ''j'' < ''n''}}, {{math|[''F''<sub>''j'' + 1</sub>:''F''<sub>''j''</sub> ] \u2264 2}}.\n\nConsequently, if a complex number is constructible, then {{math|[\u211a(''z'') : \u211a]}} is a power of two. \n\nThis algebraic characterization of constructible numbers provides an important ''necessary'' condition for constructibility: if {{math|''z''}} is constructible, then it is algebraic, and its minimal irreducible polynomial has degree a power of 2, which is equivalent to the statement that the field extension {{math|\u211a(''z'')/\u211a}} has dimension a power of 2. Note however, that the converse is false &mdash; this is not a ''sufficient'' condition for constructibility as there are non-constructible numbers {{mvar|z}} with {{math|1=[\u211a(''z'') : \u211a] = 4}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2006|loc = p.&nbsp;362}}</ref> \n \n==Trigonometric numbers==\n{{main|Trigonometric number}}\n\n[[Trigonometric number]]s are irrational cosines or sines of angles that are rational multiples of {{pi}}.

Thus, for example, {{math|cos({{pi}}/15)}} Is constructible because {{math|15}} is the product of two Fermat primes, {{math|3}} and {{math|5}}.\n\nSee [[Trigonometric constants expressed in real radicals|here]] a list of trigonometric numbers expressed in terms of square roots.\n\n== Impossible constructions ==\n[[File:Academ existence of square root of 2.svg|thumb|200px|Although duplication of the cube is impossible, duplication of the square is not.]]\n\nThe [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] thought that certain [[compass and straightedge constructions|construction problems]] they could not solve were simply obstinate, not unsolvable.<ref>{{harvnb|Stewart|1989|loc=p. 51}}</ref>  However, the non-constructibility of certain numbers proves them to be logically impossible to perform.

The restriction of using only compass and straightedge in geometric constructions is often credited to [[Plato]] due to a passage in [[Plutarch]]. According to Plutarch, Plato gave the duplication of the cube (Delian) problem to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archytas]] and [[Menaechmus]], who solved the problem using mechanical means, earning a rebuke from Plato for not solving the problem using [[pure geometry]] (Plut., ''Quaestiones convivales'' [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter8.html#section80 VIII.ii], 718ef). However, this attribution is challenged,<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 28}}</ref> due, in part, to the existence of another version of the story (attributed to [[Eratosthenes]] by [[Eutocius of Ascalon]]) that says that all three found solutions but they were too abstract to be of practical value.<ref>{{citation|title=The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Wilbur Richard|last=Knorr|authorlink=Wilbur Knorr|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1986|isbn=9780486675329|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgQS5BaTWl4C&pg=PA4}}.</ref> Since [[Oenopides]] (circa 450 BCE) is credited with two ruler and compass constructions, by [[Proclus]]&ndash; citing [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] (circa 370 - 300 BCE)&ndash;when other methods were available to him, has led some authors to hypothesize that Oenopides originated the restriction. \n\nThe restriction to compass and straightedge is essential in making these constructions impossible. Angle trisection, for instance, can be done in many ways, several known to the ancient Greeks. The [[Quadratrix of Hippias|Quadratrix]] of [[Hippias of Elis]], the [[conic section|conics]] of Menaechmus, or the marked straightedge ([[Neusis construction|neusis]]) construction of [[Archimedes]] have all been used and we can add a more modern approach via [[mathematics of paper folding|paper folding]] to the list.\n \nAlthough not one of the classic three construction problems, the problem of constructing regular polygons with straightedge and compass is usually treated alongside them. The Greeks knew how to construct regular {{mvar|n}}-gons with {{math|1=''n'' = 2<sup>''h''</sup>, 3, 5}} (for any integer {{math|''h'' \u2265 2}}) or the product of any two or three of these numbers, but other regular {{mvar|n}}-gons eluded them. Then, in 1796, an eighteen-year-old student named [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] announced in a newspaper that he had constructed a regular 17-gon with straightedge and compass.<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 29}}</ref> Gauss' treatment was algebraic rather than geometric; in fact, he did not actually construct the polygon, but rather showed that the cosine of a central angle was a constructible number. The argument was generalized in his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' giving the ''sufficient'' condition for the construction of a regular {{mvar|n}}-gon. Gauss claimed, but did not prove, that the condition was also necessary and several authors, notably [[Felix Klein]],<ref>{{citation|first=Felix|last=Klein|title=Famous Problems of Elementary Geometry|year=1956|origyear=1930|publisher=Dover|page=16}}</ref> attributed this part of the proof to him as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Kazarinoff|2003|loc=p. 30}}</ref> \n\nIn a paper from 1837,<ref>{{Citation|first = P. L.|last = Wantzel|title = Recherches sur les moyens de reconna\u00eetre si un Probl\u00e8me de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie peut se r\u00e9soudre avec la r\u00e8gle et le compas |journal = Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es|year = 1837|volume = 1|issue = 2|pages = 366\u2013372|url = http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/ConsulterElementNum?O=NUMM-16381&Deb=374&Fin=380&E=PDF}}</ref> [[Pierre Laurent Wantzel]] proved algebraically that the problems of\n* doubling the cube, and\n* trisecting the angle\nare impossible to solve if one uses only compass and straightedge. In the same paper he also solved the problem of determining which regular polygons are constructible:\n* a regular polygon is constructible [[if and only if]] the number of its sides is the product of a [[power of two]] and any number of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s (i.e., the sufficient conditions given by Gauss are also necessary)\n\nAn attempted proof of the impossibility of squaring the circle was given by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] in ''Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura'' (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667. Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of {{pi}}. It was not until 1882 that [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] rigorously proved its impossibility, by extending the work of [[Charles Hermite]] and proving that {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]].\n\nThe study of constructible numbers, per se, was initiated by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in [[La Geometrie]], an appendix to his book ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' published in 1637. Descartes associated numbers to geometrical line segments in order to display the power of his philosophical method by solving an ancient straightedge and compass construction problem put forth by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]].<ref>{{citation|first=Carl B.|last=Boyer|title=History of Analytic Geometry|year=2004|origyear=1956|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-43832-0|pages=83\u201388}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Computable number]]\n*[[Definable real number]]\n*[[Compass and straightedge constructions]]\n*[[Constructible polygon]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=John B.|last=Fraleigh|title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra|edition=5th|year=1994|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-53467-2}}\n* {{citation|first=I.

The valley and trading post received their name from a [[bald eagle]] that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured on a wall inside the post.\n\nAs the area was part of the [[Utah Territory]], it was governed from Salt Lake City, where the territorial government was headquartered. Early settlers bristled at the control by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the Nevada territory. A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry, sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned territory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oldham|first=Willa|title=Carson City: Nevada\u2019s Capital City|year=1991|publisher=Nevada State Museum|location=Carson City, NV|asin=B0006QSL8Q|page=5}}</ref> In 1858, [[Abraham Curry]] bought Eagle Station and thereafter renamed the settlement Carson City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/history/|title=Carson City Living History|author=Carson City website|accessdate=2013-01-17}}</ref>{{Failed verification|talk=Who named Carson City?|date=March 2015}} As Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development. Curry decided Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in the center of town for a capitol building.\n\nAfter gold and silver were discovered in 1859 on nearby [[Comstock Lode]], Carson City's population began to grow. Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of the city center. When territorial governor James W. Nye traveled to Nevada, he chose Carson City as the territorial capital, influenced by Carson City lawyer William Stewart, who escorted him from San Francisco to Nevada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hauck|first=Eldon|title=American Capitols|year=1991|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|page=138}}</ref> As such, Carson City bested [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and American Flat. Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a meeting hall. The Legislature named Carson City to be the seat of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]] and selected the hotel as the territorial prison with Curry serving as its first warden. Today the property is still part of the state prison.\n\nWhen Nevada became a state in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]], Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Carson City's development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center. The [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] was built between Virginia City and Carson City. A [[log flume]] was also built from the Sierra Nevadas into Carson City. The current capitol building was constructed from 1870 to 1871. The [[United States Mint]] operated the [[Carson City Mint]] between the years 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins. People came from China during that time, many to work on the railroad. Some of them owned businesses and taught school. By 1880, almost a thousand Chinese people, \"one for every five Caucasians\", has  lived in Carson City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/ |title=Dedicated to Carson's Chinese history |author=Kelli Du Fresne |publisher=Nevada Appeal |accessdate=September 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407002436/http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/ |archivedate=April 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCarson City's population and transportation traffic decreased when the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] built a line through [[Donner Pass]], too far to the north to benefit Carson City. The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]]. The US federal building (now renamed the [[Paul Laxalt]] Building) was completed in 1890 as was the [[Stewart Indian School]]. Even these developments could not prevent the city's population from dropping to just over 1,500 people by 1930. Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as \"America's smallest capital\". The city slowly grew after World War II; by 1960 it had reached its 1880 boom-time population.\n\n===20th-century revitalization and growth===\nAs early as the late 1940s, discussions began about merging Ormsby County and Carson City. By this time, the county was little more than Carson City and a few hamlets to the west. However, the effort did not pay off until 1966, when a statewide referendum approved the merger. The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968. On April 1, 1969, Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.<ref name=consolidatedmunicipality /> With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as [[Empire City, Nevada|Empire City]], which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|U.S. Route 50]]. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its {{convert|146|sqmi|km2}} of city limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=140|title=Carson City: History|author=Carson City Government|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying no building within {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=off}} of the capitol would surpass it in height.

Created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], he debuted in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938) and serves as the [[civilian]] and [[secret identity]] of the [[superhero]] ''' [[Superman]]'''.\n\nOver the decades there has been considerable debate as to which personality the character identifies with most. From his first introduction in 1938 to the mid-1980s, \"Clark Kent\" was seen mostly as a disguise for Superman, enabling him to mix with ordinary people. This was the view in most comics and other media such as movie serials and TV (e.g., in ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' starring [[Kirk Alyn]] and ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' starring [[George Reeves]]) and radio. In 1986, during [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s revamping of the character, Clark Kent became more emphasized. Different takes persist in the present, with the character typically depicted as being clumsy and mild-mannered.\n\n==Overview==\nAs Superman's [[alter ego]], the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become ingrained in popular culture as well, becoming synonymous with [[secret identity|secret identities]] and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the ''Toronto Star'' that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]], but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic [[Harold Lloyd]] and himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html |title=When Superman Worked at The Star |publisher=Davidschutz.tripod.com |date=April 26, 1992 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717013550/http://davidschutz.tripod.com/superman3.html |archivedate=July 17, 2010 |df= }}</ref> Another, perhaps more likely possibility, is that Jerry Siegel pulled from his own love of pulp heroes [[Doc Savage|Doc Clark Savage]] and [[The Shadow]] alias Kent Allard. This idea was notably stated in the book ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Rise of the American Comic Book''.\n\nClark's middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\n===Beginnings===\nIn the earliest ''Superman'' comics, Clark Kent's primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived dramatic requirement that a costumed superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time. Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Superman's activities. Although his name and history were taken from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', he receives late-breaking news before the general public, has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his story deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities\u2014bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.batman-superman.com/superman/cmp/index.html | title=The New Batman/Superman Adventures | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}</ref>\n\nTo deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a largely passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as \"mild-mannered\", perhaps most famously by the opening narration of [[Max Fleischer]]'s [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated theatrical shorts]]. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]].\n\nFellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] became the object of Clark's/Superman's romantic affection. Lois' affection for Superman and her rejection of Clark's clumsy advances have been a recurring theme in Superman comics, as well as in movies and on television.\n\n===Transitions===\nClark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two [[persona]]e and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar \"S\" emblem when called into action. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape,<ref>''New Adventures of Superboy'' #9, September 1980, et al.</ref> though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the ''Daily Planet'' storeroom<ref>''Superman: The Ten Cent Adventure'' #1, March 2003</ref>) for later retrieval.\n\nIn the Pre-Crisis [[Superman (comic book)|Superman comic book]], Clark appears in occasional back-up stories called \"The Private Life of Clark Kent\", wherein he solves problems subtly as Clark without changing into Superman. The feature was later shown in the ''[[Superman Family]]'' title.\n\n===Adoption===\nAdopted by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] from the [[Kansas]] town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], Clark (and thus Superman) was raised with the values of a typical rural American town, including attending the local [[Methodist Church]] (though it is debated by comic fans if Superman is a Methodist).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Superman.html | title=The religion of Superman (Clark Kent / Kal-El) | work=Adherents.com | date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMost continuities state that the Kents never had biological children of their own and were usually depicted as middle-aged or elderly when they found Clark. In the Golden and Silver Age versions of his origin, after the Kents retrieved Clark from his rocket, they brought him to the Smallville [[Orphanage]] and returned a few days later to formally adopt the orphan, giving him as a first name Martha's maiden name, \"Clark\".<ref name=\"no146\">''Superman'' (volume 1) #146, July 1961</ref><ref>''Limited Collector's Edition'' #C-31, November\u2013December 1974</ref> In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 origin version ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]],'' instead of adopting him through an orphanage, the Kents passed Clark off as their own child after their farm was isolated for months by a series of snowstorms that took place shortly after they found his rocket, using their past medical history of various [[miscarriage]]s to account for their reasons for keeping Martha's pregnancy secret.\n\n===Silver Age===\nIn the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] comics continuity, Clark's superpowers manifested upon his landing on Earth and he gradually learned to master them, adopting the superhero identity of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] at the age of eight. He subsequently developed Clark's timid demeanor as a means of ensuring that no one would suspect any connection between the two alter-egos.<ref name=\"no146\" /><ref>''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #1, January 1980</ref>\n\n===Modern Age retroactive continuity===\nIn the wake of [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s reboot of Superman continuity in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', many traditional aspects of Clark Kent were dropped in favor of giving him a more aggressive and extroverted personality (although not as strong as Lois's), including such aspects as making Clark a top [[American football|football]] player in high school along with being a successful author and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning writer, which includes at least two original novels, ''The Janus Contract'', and ''Under a Yellow Sun''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore,|first=John Francis|title=Under a Yellow Sun, a novel by Clark Kent|year=1994|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Furthermore, Clark's motivations for his professional writing were deepened as both a love for the art that he considers at least as a much a contribution to social good as his Superman activities and as a matter of personal fulfillment in an intellectual field in which his abilities give no unfair competition to his colleagues beyond typing extraordinarily fast. Following ''[[One Year Later]]'', Clark adopts some tricks to account for his absences, such as feigning illness or offering to call the police. These, as well as his slouching posture, are references to his earlier mild-mannered Pre-Crisis versions, but he still maintains a sense of authority and his assertive self. Feeling that Clark is the real person and that Clark is not afraid to be himself in his civilian identity, John Byrne has stated in interviews that he took inspiration for this portrayal from the [[George Reeves]] version of Superman.\n\nClark's favorite movie is ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (in which [[Gregory Peck]] wears glasses not unlike Kent's). According to the ''DC Comics Official Guide to Superman,'' Clark enjoys peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, football games, and the smell of Kansas in the springtime.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #67, #81</ref> His favorite baseball team is the Metropolis Monarchs and his favorite football team is the Metropolis Sharks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Clark is in his mid-thirties, stands at {{convert|6|ft|3|in}}, and weighs about {{convert|225|lb}}. Unlike in the Silver Age, his powers developed over several years, only coming to their peak when he was an adult.\n\n==Secret identity==\nSuperman's secret identity as Clark Kent is one of the [[DC Universe]]'s greatest secrets. Only a few trusted people are aware of it, such as [[Batman]] and other members of the [[Justice League]], Superman's cousin [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and Clark's childhood friend [[Lana Lang]]. (In pre-Crisis stories, Lana did not know, but their friend [[Pete Ross]] did, unbeknownst to anyone, including Clark.) Lex Luthor, other supervillains, and various civilians have learned the secret identity several times, though their knowledge is usually removed through various means (the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] is one of the very few to [[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali|deduce the identity and retain the knowledge]]).\n\nTraditionally, Lois Lane (and sometimes others) would often suspect Superman of truly being Clark Kent; this was particularly prominent in Silver Age stories, including those in the series ''Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane''. More recent stories (post-Crisis) often feature the general public assuming that Superman has no secret identity owing to the fact that he, unlike most heroes, does not wear a mask. In \"The Secret Revealed\", a supercomputer constructed by [[Lex Luthor]] calculated Superman's true identity from information that had been assembled by his staff, but Lex dismissed the idea because he could not believe that someone so powerful would want another, weaker identity.<ref name=\"superman v2n2\"/> In post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' continuity, Lois Lane, feeling that someone like Clark could not be Superman, never suspected the dual identity beyond one isolated incident before Clark finally revealed it to her. In \"Visitor\", Lois finds Superman at the Kent [[farm]] with [[Lana Lang]] and asks him point-blank if he is Clark Kent. Before he can answer, the Kents tell her that they raised Superman alongside Clark like a brother.<ref name=\"Action 597\">''Action Comics'' #597 (February 1988)</ref> In the 2009 [[retcon]] of the mythos, Lois Lane is fully aware from the beginning, along with [[Perry White]], that the meek, pudgy, and bumbling Clark Kent deliberately holds himself back: however, still far from associating him with Superman, they simply believe he's hiding his qualities as a good reporter.<ref name=SSO3 />\n\nIn the current continuity established by DC's [[The New 52|New 52]] relaunch in 2011, Lois Lane remains unaware that Clark is Superman until she discovers his identity as part of an elaborate plan by new villain Hordr-Root&mdash;later revealed to be a son of [[Vandal Savage]]&mdash;to blackmail Superman at the same time as he is experiencing a strange power shortage, with his abilities gradually draining each time he uses them. Shortly before this trouble began, Superman also revealed his identity to [[Jimmy Olsen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/off-my-mind-superman-finally-reveals-his-identity/1100-151264/|title=Off My Mind: Superman Finally Reveals His Identity|publisher=Comic Vine}}</ref> In an attempt to protect Superman from his Hordr-Root's blackmail efforts, Lois reveals his identity herself, forcing Clark to go off-grid to find the source of his power shortage after his ''Daily Planet'' colleagues abandon him in disgust at his lies. This storyline concludes with the New 52 Superman being forced to subject himself to a form of kryptonite chemotherapy to restore his powers and defeat Savage's latest plot, only to subsequently die of kryptonite poisoning.\n\nFollowing the death of the New-52 Superman, he is 'replaced' as Superman by his counterpart from the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline&mdash;who operates in secret in a farmhouse with his wife and son after the events of ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' saw them trapped in this new universe&mdash;but all are left puzzled when a completely human Clark Kent appears. Superman's tests confirming that this new man genuinely believes that he is Clark Kent, adopted by the Kents after his biological parents died in a gas explosion when he was three months old, who went into hiding while investigating the mysterious Geneticorp and allowed Superman to claim to be him to divert attention from his own actions.<ref>''Action Comics'' vol. 1 #964</ref> However, when Lois&mdash;replacing her apparently dead New 52 counterpart&mdash;accepts a date with this Clark to find out more about him, she is unnerved when he goes all out on their date, hiring a limo and booking an expensive restaurant to propose to her. When Lois leaves, she is followed by 'Clark' back to the house she lives in with her family, with 'Clark' being so outraged at the sight of Lois with someone else that he triggers an attack that somehow erases the Kents' entire house and their son Jon, subsequently revealing that he is really [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], having subjected himself to an intense spell that made him literally ''believe'' he was Clark Kent for a time. This confrontation with Mxyzptlk concludes with the essence of pre-''Flashpoint'' Clark and Lois merging with the essences of their ''New 52'' counterparts, allowing them to exist in the new universe with a mixture of their pre-''Flashpoint'' and ''New 52'' histories, although Mxyzptlk's actions have allowed Superman to resume his identity as Clark.\n\nIn the 2016 miniseries American Alien, written by Max Landis. Clark's powers and the fact he is Superman's alter ego is an open secret in Smallville. This is due primarily to power flare ups that happened in his childhood, such as spontaneously beginning to float in front of his friends at a drive through movie. The Smallville Police Department even approach a young Clark to ask for his help solving a local murder.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Landis|first1=Max|title=American Alien|publisher=DC}}</ref>\n\nIn the future of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], his secret identity is historical fact, with exhibits at a Superman Museum depicting the hero and his friends' and family's adventures.\n\n===Security of identity===\nVarious explanations over the decades have been offered for why people have never suspected Superman and Clark Kent of being one and the same:\n*The explanation most commonly offered is simply that, despite their physical resemblance, Superman and Clark are perceived as being too different in mannerisms and personality to be the same individual. Some comics note, in the words of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], that \"Clark slouches, wears clothes two sizes too big and raises his voice an octave\", making him appear shorter and overweight instead of muscular.<ref name=SSO3>''Superman: Secret Origin'' #3 (2009)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern'' #44 (September 2009)</ref> The 2004 limited series ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' has a young Clark Kent study the [[Meisner technique]] to move seamlessly between his Clark and Superman personae (dropping his head, lowering his shoulders, and talking in a lighter tone as Clark Kent, while standing straight and talking in a deeper tone as Superman). Live-action actors adopting this approach while playing Clark Kent/Superman include:\n**George Reeves in the 1950s live-action television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' who brought a naturalistic approach to the dual role. Reeves played Clark as moderately assertive, often taking charge in dangerous or risky situations and unafraid to take reasonable risks. This fact was one of the main inspirations for the 1980s reboot of the Clark Kent half of the Superman character, according to writer and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in the article \"Super-Discussions\" published by [[Attic Books]] in ''Comics Values Monthly'' Special #2 (1992).\n**[[Christopher Reeve]] in the [[Superman film series]], who was praised for making the disguise's effectiveness credible to audiences, portrayed Clark Kent as clumsy and mild mannered. In his book ''[[Still Me]],'' Reeve says he based his interpretation of Clark Kent on [[Cary Grant]]'s nerdy character in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]''. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] described his performance on the commentary track for ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' as always playing Superman but, when he was Clark, playing Superman playing Clark Kent.\n**[[Dean Cain]] in the 1990s series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' showed Clark as a normal and shy Everyman demonstrating occasional touches of clumsiness (e.g., pretending to burn his mouth on coffee), but still a highly skilled journalist, much like the current post-''Crisis'' portrayal. His Superman, by contrast, was very much the model of the classic hero who stood up straight and spoke in a more formal and authoritative voice. In the episode \"Tempus Fugitive\", the time-traveler [[Tempus (Lois and Clark)|Tempus]] mocks Lois, saying that future historians laugh at her for being fooled by a pair of glasses. On the other hand, [[H.G. Wells]] tells Lois that in truth the people of the future simply considered Lois to be blinded by love, and that this has made her story a compelling one throughout the intervening years.<ref name = \"tempus\">{{cite episode|title=Tempus Fugitive|series=[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]] |credits=Lee Hutson, Jack Weinstein (writers) & James R. Bagdonas (director)|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate=1995-03-26|season=2|number=18|minutes=}}</ref>\n*In the 1970s, one suggestion was that the lenses of Clark Kent's glasses (made of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] materials) constantly amplified a low-level super-[[hypnosis]] power, thereby creating the illusion of others viewing Clark Kent as a weak and frailer being.<ref name=\"superman 330\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #330 (December 1978)</ref> However, this reason was abandoned almost as quickly as it was introduced, since it had various flaws (such as stories where [[Batman]], who is at the peak of human fitness, would disguise himself as Clark Kent, among others).<ref>http://i1166.photobucket.com/albums/q616/2lelak/33bBatmanRescue.gif</ref>\n*Another reason given in the 1987 story \"The Secret Revealed\" was that the public simply does not know that Superman ''has'' a secret identity, considering he does not wear a [[mask]], which implies to most that he has nothing to hide. As an added precaution, Superman would vibrate his face slightly (like [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick, the Golden-Age Flash]]), so that photographs would only show his features as a blur, thus preventing the danger of photographs of both identities being reliably compared.<ref name=\"superman v2n2\">''Superman'' (vol. 2) #2 (February 1987)</ref> However, more subsequent stories showing Superman being photographed have tended to ignore this factor. The 2004 series ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' also explained that Superman's eyes are an inhumanly vivid shade of blue, which Clark's glasses diffuse to make his eyes appear more human{{issue|date=January 2013}}. A subsequent explanation is the fact that most people only know of Clark as a name in a byline and only see Superman from a distance, if they see him at all. As most people do not spend much time with both Clark Kent ''and'' Superman, the similar appearances are not considered.\n**A variation of this idea was seen when Lex Luthor had a massive investigation carried out to determine the connection between Clark Kent and Superman; while the resulting data gathered allowed a computer to deduce that Clark Kent ''was'' Superman, Luthor dismissed that theory as he is psychologically incapable of understanding why Superman would ''want'' to be someone like Clark, believing that Superman would constantly revel in his power just because that is what Luthor would do.\n**The idea of Superman's identity being secret as the idea never occurs to others has been further explored in other continuities. In the [[Elseworlds]] story ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]''\u2014a sequel to ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', where Kal-El was discovered by and raised in an Amish community when the Kents' truck had a nail in the tyre on the day they would have gone out and seen his ship crash\u2014 while trying to establish a civilian identity to give new hero Superman a chance to feel human, the Kents initially heavily disguised him with a thick fake beard and large dark glasses. Arriving as they put this disguise together, Lois Lane suggests the alternative of regular glasses and casual hair, on the grounds that the original look gave the impression that he had something to hide, while nobody would particularly pay attention to Kal-El when he looked like this.\n* Various stories over the decades often show Superman relying upon an imitator on occasions when Clark and Superman are required to appear together. The most prominent such means include:\n** '''[[Superman robot]]s''', androids that physically resemble Superman in powers and appearance.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #156, October 1962</ref> Superman robots were primarily used during the Silver Age, but were largely disposed of after the early '70s.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #202, May 1971</ref> Clark Kent robots were also maintained by Superman for similar purposes.<ref>''Action Comics'' #282, November 1961</ref>\n** '''Batman''' disguising himself as either Clark or Superman. This was most often seen in Silver Age stories.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #71, July\u2013August 1954</ref>\n** '''Shapeshifters''' have also aided Clark in protecting his secret identity. For example, after the \"Return of Superman\" storyline in the 1990s, \"Clark\" (in reality the Supergirl at the time, also known as [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Matrix]], who was capable of shape shifting) was photographed besides Superman after Superman had returned from the dead, Matrix using her shape-shifting abilities to create the impression that Clark Kent had been trapped in an underground bunker during Doomsday's rampage to account for Clark and Superman's mutual absences. In other occasions, Clark's comrade in the [[Justice League]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], has provided similar assistance.\n\n===Identity change===\n[[File:Clark Kent -Superman Action.png|thumb|right|250px|An apparently ordinary Clark Kent, transforming into Superman. {{Descript-cvr-art|Superman Forever|1|1|June, 1998|pub=DC|art=Alex Ross}}]]\nWhen crises arise, Clark quickly changes into Superman. Originally during his appearances in ''[[Action Comics]]'' and later in his own magazine, the Man of Steel would strip to his costume and stand revealed as Superman, often with the transformation having already been completed. But within a short time, Joe Shuster and his ghost artists began depicting Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the \"S\" insignia on his chest\u2014an image that became so iconic that other superheroes, during the Golden Age and later periods, would copy the same type of change during transformations.\n\nIn the Fleischer theatrical cartoons released by Paramount, the mild-mannered reporter often ducked into a telephone booth or stockroom to make the transformation. Since the shorts were produced during the rise of [[film noir]] in cinema, the change was usually represented as a stylized sequence: Clark Kent's silhouette is clearly seen behind a closed door's pebble glass window (or a shadow thrown across a wall) as he strips to his Superman costume. Then, the superhero emerges having transformed from his meek disguise to his true self. In the comic books and in the George Reeves television series, he favors the ''Daily Planet''{{'}}s storeroom for his changes of identities (the heroic change between identities within the storeroom is almost always seen in the comics, but never viewed in the Reeves series).\n\nThe [[CBS]] Saturday morning series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'' produced by Filmation Studios\u2014as well as ''[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' from the same animation house\u2014featured the iconic \"shirt rip\" to reveal the \"S\" or Clark Kent removing his unbuttoned white dress shirt in a secluded spot, usually thanks to stock animation which was reused over dozens of episodes, to reveal his costume underneath while uttering his famed line \"This is a job for '''Superman!'''\"\n\nAs a dramatic plot device, Clark often has to quickly improvise in order to find a way to change unnoticed. For example, in ''Superman'' (1978), Clark, unable to use a newer, open-kiosk pay phone (and getting a nice laugh from the theater audience), runs down the street and rips open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath. He quickly enters a revolving door, spinning through it at incredible speed while changing clothes. Thus made invisible, he appears to have entered the building as Clark Kent and exited seconds later as Superman. Later in the film, when the need to change is more urgent (as he believes the city is about to be poisoned by Lex Luthor), he simply jumps out a window of the ''Daily Planet'' offices, changing at super-speed as he falls (the film merely shows the falling Kent blurring into a falling Superman) and flies off. Further films in the series continued this tradition, with Clark blurring into Superman, changing at super-speed while he runs.\n\nIn ''Lois & Clark,'' Clark's usual method of changing was to either \"suddenly\" remember something urgent that required his immediate attention or leave the room/area under the pretense of contacting a source, summoning the police, heading to a breaking story's location, etc. The change would then frequently occur off-screen, although the shirt-rip reveal was a prominently used move well-associated with the show. Clark also developed a method of rapidly spinning into his costume at super speed which became a trademark change, especially during the third and fourth seasons of the series, and extremely popular with the show's fans. An alternate universe Clark (who lost his adoptive parents as a child and only adopted the Superman persona at the urging of Lois from the main timeline) was shown to enter an empty room and emerge as Superman a moment later, although he did adopt the spinning move eventually at Lois' advice.\n\nIn one scene of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Clark becomes aware of an emergency while talking with [[Bruce Wayne]] and, in the next [[panel (comics)|panel]], he has flown out of his Kent clothing and glasses so quickly that they have had no time to fall.\n\nIn Season 8 of ''Smallville,'' Clark begins to show a bit more of his double identity. He starts slowing down his superspeed enough for surveillance cameras to see his iconic red and blue streak. This reveals to the citizens of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] that a superhero is among them and the name \"The Red-Blue Blur\" is coined. When Jimmy Olsen becomes suspicious, Clark decides to reserve his usual red-and-blue for saving people. He carries a backpack with him to work every day, containing his change of clothes. He begins to practice his speed change at home and at the ''Daily Planet.'' He changes in a superspeed spin in the ''Daily Planet''{{'}}s phone booth and once even in his office chair. The last minute of the last episode of ''Smallville'' had Clark responding to an emergency, rushing to the top of the Daily Planet building, and then using the familiar shirt-rip while the camera zoomed in on the familiar S-logo to the original John Williams fanfare.\n\n===Debate over true identity===\n[[File:Superman and Clark Kent.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Clark Kent and Superman, from ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (vol. 1) #296 (February 1976). Art by [[Bob Oksner]].]]\nThere is debate as to which of the two identities (Superman or Clark Kent) is the real person and which is the fa\u00e7ade. Fans and Superman scholars follow one of three interpretations:\n*'''Superman is real, Clark Kent the mask:''' Pre-Crisis interpretations of Superman assumed that Clark Kent was the \"mask\" and Kal-El the person (in the classic story ''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'', when Superman's dual life is revealed, he completely abandons his Clark Kent persona). In one 1960s comic, when Kent finds himself at a loose end when staff at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' go on strike, he seriously considers it a chance to try out a new identity in case he has \"to abandon [his] Clark Kent role permanently\". His options include becoming a full-time policeman or even a mere tramp \"whom no one would ever suspect of being the Man of Steel\".<ref>Illustration included in the ''Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967.</ref> In the ''Smallville'' episode \"Masquerade\", Clark tells Lois that Clark Kent is just a name, just two words, and that the Blur is who he really is. This argument, made in [[Jules Feiffer]]'s series of articles published in ''The Great Comic Book Heroes,'' is famously cited in a climactic scene of ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2]],'' with the character of Bill noting that Superman was not born into his alter ego ([[Spider-Man]] was \"Peter Parker\" first, [[Batman]] was born \"Bruce Wayne\"), using the blanket he was wrapped in as his costume, and Clark Kent is a collage of mankind's less impressive traits meant to blend in with other humans (as well as a device to pursue Lois Lane's affections), using this analogy to demonstrate how the character of the Bride could never abandon the killer she is even if she pretended to be something else, though as Bill is the villain of the movie, whether or not audiences are meant to empathize with anything he says is debatable. [[Richard Donner]], the director of the first Reeve movie, stated that he believes Clark Kent to be the disguise (this is never made clear in the film).\n*'''Clark Kent is real, Superman the mask:''' With John Byrne's more assertive revamp of Clark Kent as well as Superman's greater grounding in Earth culture and humanity (as opposed to the everpresent Kryptonian heritage of the Pre-''Crisis'' version), Superman is considered the \"mask\" and Clark the person. This is made explicit by Clark himself in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #53, when following his revelation to Lois of his role as Superman (''Action Comics'' #662), he states: \"I'm Clark, the man you love. Superman is the creation&nbsp;\u2013 you named me, Lois.\" In pre-Crisis continuity, Kal-El was already a toddler before leaving Krypton, and retained memories of that childhood that later resurfaced, while, in Post-''Crisis'' continuity, he was sent to Earth pre-natally in a \"birthing matrix\" (more recently [[retcon]]ned as an infant) and raised entirely by the Kents. As a result of their rearing, Kal-El grows up to think of himself as Clark Kent, completely unaware of his alien heritage until he was well into adulthood (the fact that the Kents found him sometime just after the [[Cold War]] meant that the Kents assumed the rocket they found him in was from an Earth-based space program&nbsp;\u2014 possibly that of [[Communist]] Russia&nbsp;\u2014 and that Clark had superhuman abilities because he was either a metahuman or some kind of genetic experiment). Although the morals instilled in him by the Kents have motivated Kal-El to use his abilities to help others, he developed the Superman persona to protect his Clark Kent identity. In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"The Late Mr. Kent\", wherein Clark Kent is presumed dead, Superman expresses frustration at the idea of not being Clark and having to be someone else instead (\"I ''am'' Clark. I need to be Clark. I'd go crazy if I had to be Superman all the time!\"). In a previous episode, the third part of the \"Last Son of Krypton\" arc, Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent assures his adoptive son that he will \"always be Clark Kent\" and that \"Superman just helps out every now and then.\" In the \"Tempus Fugitive\" episode of ''Lois & Clark'', Clark attempts to persuade Lois that Superman does not define him: \"Superman is what I can do. Clark is who I ''am''.\"\n*'''Neither Clark Kent nor Superman is the real person:''' Some versions of Superman explain that the Clark Kent and Superman identities are different facets of the same person. It has been implied, especially in the 'alternate future' story ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', that the Clark Kent persona represents the values taught to him by his Midwestern parents. These values are what he holds most dear, giving him an instinctive knowledge of right and wrong that allows him to adopt his Superman persona without being consumed by the moral implications of his actions. Superman is the means through which he can bring this example to the world at large. At the story's climax, when Superman stands poised to destroy the United Nations, Norman McCay makes him realise that, when he abandoned Clark Kent fifteen years prior (after the murder of Lois Lane by the Joker) and retreated into his Superman self, he lost his instinctive morality, and thus the ability to be a heroic Superman. With this knowledge and a pair of glasses given to him as a gift by Wonder Woman, \"Clark\" regains his humanity and sets out to become a hero again by re-fertilizing the formerly-irradiated fields of Kansas. Director Bryan Singer stated at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] that he favored the three-persona concept, stating that there was Clark Kent on the farm, the bumbling Metropolis Clark, and Superman, the Last Son of Krypton. Brandon Routh himself stated, in an ''[[HBO First Look]]'' interview that he was playing three characters: Clark Kent, the reporter/farm boy; Superman, the protagonist and savior of Metropolis; and Kal-El, the Last Son of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].\n\nClark Kent has also been depicted without the Superman alter ego. In the [[Elseworlds]] stories starting with ''[[Superman: Last Son of Earth]]'', he is the son of Jonathan Kent, who saves his son from the destruction of the Earth. Clark ends up on Krypton, where he is adopted by Jor-El and becomes the planet's [[Green Lantern]].\n\n==In other media==\n\n===''The Adventures of Superman'' radio series (1940\u20131951)===\nIn the early ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|Adventures of Superman]]'' radio episodes, Kal-El landed on Earth as an adult. He saved a man and his son and they gave him the idea of living as a normal person. They gave him the name of Clark Kent, and he later got a job as a newspaper reporter under that name. In that role he adopted a higher voice and a more introverted personality&nbsp;\u2013 clearly establishing that Kent is the secret identity and Superman is the true person.\n\nLater episodes shifted to the usual origin story, in which Kal-El landed on Earth as a baby and was raised by the Kent family.\n\n[[Bud Collyer|Clayton \"Bud\" Collyer]] voiced both Clark Kent and Superman, until [[Michael Fitzmaurice (actor)|Michael Fitzmaurice]] replaced him in the final episodes.\n\n===Kirk Alyn film serials (1948\u20131950)===\nIn the film serials ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), [[Kirk Alyn]] portrays Clark as a mild-mannered reporter who comes to Metropolis and secures a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', following the death of his foster parents. While he quickly gains the respect of ''Planet'' editor Perry White, he is forced to contend with rival reporter Lois Lane, who often uses trickery to prevent Clark from pursuing a lead (giving her the chance to scoop him). Nevertheless, his journalistic skills are useful as he pursues stories on the crime boss known as the Spider Lady, and the criminal scientist [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] (who had yet to receive his first name, Lex).\n\n===''Adventures of Superman'' TV series (1952\u20131958)===\nIn the 1950s [[George Reeves]] series, Clark Kent is portrayed as a cerebral character who is the crime reporter for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and who as Kent uses his intelligence and powers of deduction to solve crimes (often before [[Inspector Henderson]] does) before catching the villain as Superman. Examples include the episodes ''Mystery of the Broken Statues'', ''A Ghost for Scotland Yard'', ''The Man in the Lead Mask'', and ''The Golden Vulture''. George Reeves' Kent/Superman is also established as a champion of justice for the oppressed in episodes like ''The Unknown People'' and ''The Birthday Letter''. Although Kent is described in the show introduction as \"mild-mannered\", he can be very assertive, often giving orders to people and taking authoritative command of situations, though, as in the Pre-Crisis Superman stories at that time, Clark is still considered the secret identity. He gets people to trust his judgment very easily and has a good, often wisecracking, sense of humor. Reeves, who first appeared as the character in the 1951 film ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', was older than subsequent Superman actors.\n\n===Christopher Reeve ''Superman'' films (1978\u20131987) and ''Superman Returns'' (2006)===\n<!--[[File:Clarksupescompare.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Christopher Reeve's appearance altered slightly between playing Superman and Clark Kent.]]-->\nIn 1978, the [[Superman (1978 film)|first]] of four Superman films was made in which Clark Kent and Superman were portrayed by [[Christopher Reeve]] (with teenage Kent played by [[Jeff East]] in the first film). This was followed nearly two decades later by a fifth film called ''[[Superman Returns]]'' with [[Brandon Routh]] giving a performance very similar to Reeve's. In contrast to George Reeves' intellectual Clark Kent, Reeve's version is much more of an awkward fumbler and bungler, although Reeve is also an especially athletic, dashing and debonair Superman. Clark Kent's hair is always absolutely flat, while Superman's hair has a slight wave and is parted on the opposite side as Kent's. These films leave the impression that Clark Kent is really a ''secret'' identity that is used to enable Superman to serve humanity better, rather than just a role to help him assimilate into the human community.\n\nA great deal of emphasis is placed on his origins on the planet Krypton with exotic crystalline sets designed by [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]], effectively giving Superman a third persona as Kal-El. The first film is in three sections: Kal-El's infancy on Krypton (shot in London on the 007 stage), Clark Kent's teen years in Smallville, and Kent/Superman's adult life in Metropolis (shot in New York City). In earlier sections of the film, Reeve's Kent interacts with both his earthly parents and the spirit of his Kryptonian father through a special crystal, in a way George Reeves never did. The film has a fair amount of quasi-Biblical imagery suggestive of Superman as a sort of Christ-figure sent by Jor-El \"to show humans the way\".<ref>This is discussed by the producers in their DVD commentary to the original theatrical cut.</ref> (See also [[Superman (1978 film)#Themes]]). In ''Superman II'' Reeve's Superman has to sacrifice his powers (effectively becoming just Clark Kent) in order to have a love relationship with Lois Lane, a choice he eventually abrogates to protect the world.\n\nThe relationship between Superman and Kent came to actual physical blows in ''[[Superman III]]''. Superman is given a piece of manufactured [[Kryptonite]], but instead of weakening or killing him it drives him crazy, depressed, angry, and casually destructive, committing crimes which range from petty acts of vandalism to environmental disasters, like causing an [[oil spillage]] in order to bed a lusty woman by the name of Lorelei in league with the villains. Driven [[alcoholic]], Superman, his outfit dirty and neglected, eventually goes to a [[Wrecking yard|car wrecking yard]] where Kent, in a proper business suit and glasses, suddenly emerges from within him. A fight ensues in which the \"evil\" Superman tries to dispose of the \"good\" Kent, but the latter fights back, \"kills\" the evil side to his nature and, reclaiming the Superman mantle, sets off to repair the damage and capture the villains. [[Les Daniels]] comments in his book, ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favourite Comic Book Heroes'', \"The 'good' Superman, ultimately triumphant, (is) dressed as Clark, thus implying that he is the more valid personality (as well as the one Lana loves)\" and expresses annoyance that \"Something could have been made of this, but sadly nothing was\".\n\nThe indirect \"Christianization\" of Superman in the Reeve films (admitted by film producer [[Pierre Spengler]] on the [[DVD]] commentaries) has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]]'s book ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey|Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero]]'' says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a \"nebbish\", saying, \"He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's [[Woody Allen]].\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/super-mensch| title=Super...

This same theme is pursued about '40s superheroes generally in ''Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero'' by [[Danny Fingeroth]].\n\n===''Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman'' (1993\u20131997)===\nClark Kent's character is given one of its heaviest emphases in the 1990s series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. It is made very clear during the series, even discussed directly by the characters, that Clark Kent is who he really is, rather than his superheroic alter-ego.\n\nIn ''Lois and Clark'', Kent ([[Dean Cain]]) is a stereotypical wide-eyed farm kid from Kansas with the charm, grace and humor of George Reeves, but without the awkward geekiness of Christopher Reeve. Emphasis is laid on the comic elements of his dual relationship with Lois Lane ([[Teri Hatcher]]). The ban on Christopher Reeve's Superman having a relationship with a human while retaining his superpowers is entirely absent in the world of ''Lois and Clark.'' In the final season, Clark Kent marries Lois Lane (a few years after her almost-marriage to his arch-enemy [[Lex Luthor]], whom she refused at the altar), finding love, happiness, and completeness in this relationship which does not jeopardize his Superman persona.\n\nSuperman's secret identity was discovered by a number of villains during the series. In some cases, like that of [[Lex Luthor]], the villain died before he could share the discovery. In two cases, the claim was discredited by having Superman and Clark appear together in public, using a hologram in the first case and a Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the second (in the first case, there was also footage filmed of Superman uniforms in Kent's closet, but that was explained by stating Superman simply needs a place to store them). In one case, Superman destroyed the evidence (a time traveler's journal), and stated that the villain's unsupported words will be ignored.\n\n===''Smallville'' TV series (2001\u20132011)===\n{{Further|Clark Kent (Smallville)}}\n''[[Smallville]]'' was adapted to television in 2001, by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Clark Kent is played by [[Tom Welling]], with others portraying Clark as an infant. Throughout the series, Clark never officially adopted a costume until around the eighth season, but prior to this was seen wearing Superman's traditional colors of red and blue, more often as the series progresses (more commonly a blue shirt underneath a red jacket, reflecting Superman's uniform and cape colors). He is going through a process of character formation, making many mistakes in his youth, over time forming better and better judgment, while always self-consciously aware of his status as an alien from another planet who is different from other people. In season eight, he begins a fight against evil, hoping to be a source of inspiration and hope to others. A modest amount of religious imagery is seen occasionally in the series, but to a lesser degree than in the Christopher Reeve series.\n\n''[[Smallville]]'''s Kent is particularly inwardly conflicted as he attempts to live the life of a normal human being, while keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8\u201317|isbn=1-84023-795-3}}</ref> Throughout the first seven seasons of the series he has a complicated relationship with Lana Lang,<ref>Episode in which the pair start and end their relationship: season two's \"Exodus\", season three's \"Phoenix\", season five's \"Arrival\" & \"Hypnotic\", season seven's \"Fierce\" & \"Arctic\"</ref> as well as his self-perceived guilt over the fact that the meteor shower that killed Lana's parents and created most of the superhumans he fought in the show's first few years was caused by his rocket coming to Earth and dragging pieces of Krypton with it. Clark's powers appear over time. He is not aware of all of his powers at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until seasons [[Smallville (season 2)|two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Heat|series=Smallville|credits=Mark Verheiden (writer) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2002-10-01|season=2|number=2|minutes=42}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Sneeze|series=Smallville|credits=Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer (writers) & Paul Shapiro (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2006-10-06|season=6|number=2}}</ref> and his power of flight did not emerge until the series finale, up until that point the power appeared only in a few rare cases, such as when he was temporarily 're-programmed' to assume a Kryptonian persona or when he was trapped in a virtual reality.\n\nClark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life.<ref>{{cite episode | title=Pilot | series=Smallville | credits=[[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] (writers); [[David Nutter]] (director) | network=The WB | airdate=October 16, 2001 | season=1 | number=1 | minutes=42}}</ref> (Boyhood friendship with Lex Luthor had been the basis of a ''[[Superboy]]'' adventure published in 1960).<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #271 (April 1960)</ref>\n\nClark and Lex remain entangled for most of the series. Lex Luthor's father, [[Lionel Luthor]], is an unscrupulous industrialist with whom Lex has a troubled relationship. Lex would like to transcend his family background and be a better person than his father, but after multiple setbacks he slowly slips into evil, becoming convinced that only way he can \"protect\" the world from the perceived alien threats is by taking control of it, regardless of the cost to others. In turn, Clark Kent has a slightly dark side with which he comes to grips over time, made even worse by his experiences with Red Kryptonite, which causes him to lose his morals and act solely on impulse while under its influence. In different ways to Luthor, at times Clark also does not have a fully ideal relationship either with his adoptive father, Jonathan, nor with an A.I. based on Jor-El that was sent by the original to guide him, Jonathan occasionally having trouble relating to Clark while Jor-El's lack of his template's emotions causes him to treat Clark too harshly at times. The younger Luthor slightly envies Clark's \"clean-cut\" and wholesome parents (who disapprove of Clark's friendship with Luthor), while Clark is impressed with Luthor's wealth while failing to understand some of the manipulations he carries out in his interactions with others. Even in his better days, Luthor is highly ambitious for power and wealth, at one time noting that he shares his name with [[Alexander the Great]]. Clark Kent, on the other hand, has no idea what he is going to do with his life while bewildered by his powers, and his uncertainty as to why he was sent to Earth.\n\nIn season eight of ''Smallville'', Clark Kent begins to work as a reporter at the ''Daily Planet''. Shortly after he begins to save lives as an anonymous superhero crimefighter, which becomes known as the \"Red-Blue Blur\" after a photograph is taken of one of his rescues.\n\nIn season nine, Clark unintentionally begins to formalize his dual identity to protect his secret and also privately introduces the well-known glasses to Lois Lane. Additionally, during the opening scene of the season nine finale, Clark finds a gift from his mother containing his Superman suit (although the suit is subsequently taken by Jor-El until Clark is ready for it).\n\nIn season ten, for the first time in public Clark begins to formulate a bumbling/stuttering Kent with glasses akin to the Christoper Reeve/Brandon Routh portrayal of the character. In the season ten finale of the series he fully adopts the Superman identity, when he takes action to save Earth from [[Darkseid]], who was drawn to Earth by Clark's actions and sought to take the hero as a host.\n\n''Smallville''{{'}}s Kent has also appeared in various literature (including comics and over a dozen [[young adult novels]]) based on the television series.\n\n===Animated series===\nIn the 1940s Superman shorts, Clark is shown to have a wisecracking sense of humor and he and Lois are good friends. At the end of each short Clark commonly gives a smile and a wink to the audience (a knowing mannerism which was carried over to the 1966 Superman animated series), an example of [[breaking the fourth wall]].\n\nIn the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' of the mid to late 1990s, Clark Kent is shown as a mild-mannered but competent reporter and is shown exposing various criminals through his reporter identity. In this identity, Clark and Lois are good friends (with Lois frequently calling him \"Smallville\" in a teasing but good-natured way) but do not share romantic feelings; instead, it is Superman and Lois who have a romantic relationship. Lana Lang on the other hand knows of Clark's identity as Superman but seems more interested in Clark because she knew him as that first.\n\n===Arrowverse===\n\nClark Kent/Superman appeared in the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' portrayed by [[Tyler Hoechlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/supergirl-adding-superman-season-2-899862|title='Supergirl' Will Introduce Superman In Season 2|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=June 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/16/superman-cast-for-supergirl-series|title=SUPERMAN CAST FOR SUPERGIRL: SEASON 2|last=Fowler|first=Matt|publisher=IGN|date=June 16, 2016|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref> Compared to Superman's charismatic and strong personality, Clark purposefully comes off as clumsy around others to help maintain his secret identity, though he admits that some of his ineptitudes are genuine. He maintains a close friendship with James Olsen and his romantic relationship with Lois Lane is strong, to the chagrin of his former coworker Cat Grant. He is very supportive of his cousin Kara, often staying in touch with her via [[instant messaging]] to give her advice.\n\n===DC Extended Universe===\nIn the Superman reboot film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', Clark Kent is portrayed by [[Henry Cavill]], with [[Dylan Sprayberry]] and Cooper Timberline portraying younger versions of the character.\n\nIn this film, Kal-El is Krypton's first natural birth in centuries, a birth without using Krypton's genesis chamber. In order to save Krypton's future and stop Zod's coup, his biological father [[Jor-El]] steals Krypton's DNA template (Codex), bonds it to Kal-El's cells, and sends him to Earth before Krypton explodes. Kal-El's ship lands in a small [[Kansas]] town. He is raised as the adoptive son of Jonathan and Martha Kent, who name him Clark.\n\nAs a boy, Clark is a conflicted and lonely person who questions his place and purpose in the world. At a very young age, he learns of his superhuman abilities such as X-ray vision and superhuman strength, and this discovery frightens him. Jonathan Kent impresses on Clark to keep his abilities a secret and not to use them openly for fear of the consequences. This comes to a head when Clark uses his powers to save his schoolmates from drowning after their bus crashes into a lake. Jonathan is dismayed that Clark would risk exposing himself, and even tells Clark that maybe he should have let the kids die. Despite being ridiculed throughout his childhood and adolescence, Clark still wants to use his abilities to help others and make a difference in the world. This causes tension between him and Jonathan, who would rather he remain on the farm, believing that a useful endeavor by itself, and live his life in relative safety. Jonathan carries this conviction even to his death, when he stops Clark from saving him from being killed by a [[tornado]] to prevent him revealing his powers to others.\n\nAfter Jonathan's death, an adult Clark spends several years living a nomadic lifestyle, working different jobs under false identities while saving people in secret, as well as struggling to cope with the loss of his adoptive father. He is now shown to be a confused, slightly angry individual who is forced to show restraint to bring harm to those who try to harm him or others. He eventually infiltrates a U.S. military investigation of a Kryptonian scout spaceship in the [[Arctic]]. Clark enters the alien ship and communicates with the preserved consciousness of Jor-El in the form of a hologram. Jor-El reveals Clark's origins and the extinction of his race, and tells Clark that he was sent to Earth to bring hope to mankind. [[Lois Lane]], a journalist from the Daily Planet sent to write a story on the discovery, sneaks inside the ship while following Clark and is rescued by him when she is injured. Lois' editor, [[Perry White]], rejects her story of a \"superhuman\" rescuer, so she traces Clark back to Kansas with the intention of writing an [[Expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]]. After hearing his story, she decides not to reveal his secret. After the discovery of his background and purpose, he is shown to be less confused and a little more joyful, as evidenced by his discussion with his adoptive mother Martha.\n\nWhen Zod arrives to transform Earth into a new Krypton, Lois helps Clark/Superman stop Zod. By film's end, to create an alias that gives him access to dangerous situations without arousing suspicion, Clark takes a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet and adopts a modernized version of his \"mild-mannered\" look from the comics.\n\nIt is worth noting that, as a nod to many comics, Clark is implied to have an interest in football, as evidenced when he is seen watching a game while drinking beer just before Zod's arrival and ultimatum.\n\nHenry Cavill reprises his role as Clark Kent in the film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. Here, his full name is given as '''Clark Joseph Kent'''. Nearly two years after the events of Man of Steel, Clark and Lois are close in their relationship, but Clark finds himself continually questioning his role as Superman. At the beginning, he rescues Lois from African terrorists when a riot ensues that he is blamed for. When he hears of Batman's actions in Gotham, he decides to investigate against Perry White's orders, believing Batman's methods to be unjust. He meets Bruce Wayne at a party hosted by Lex Luthor and grows suspicious when he hears Alfred communicating to Bruce in an earpiece. He later confronts Batman when the vigilante is chasing down Luthor's men who have kryptonite, and orders him to cease his activities. Superman is later summoned by Senator June Finch to the U.S. Capitol to discuss his actions, but the room is bombed by Luthor, framing Superman once more. He goes into a self-exile, feeling guilty for not stopping the bombing.\n\nLater, he dons the costume once more when Lois is endangered by Lex, and confronts the scientist on the roof. However, Lex reveals he knows all about Clark's true identity and blackmails Superman into fighting Batman by holding Martha hostage. Superman tries to reason with Batman, revealing that he knows his secrets, but this leads to a fight in which Batman nearly kills Superman with a kryptonite spear. Superman pleads for Batman to \"save Martha\", which was also the latter's late mother's name, causing him to come to his senses and realize Superman is not a threat. Upon learning of Luthor's plan, Batman leaves to rescue Martha while Superman confronts Luthor, who unleashes a monstrous artificially-bred creature he dubs as Clark's \"Doomsday\" made with Kryptonian technology on the crashed ship. Superman is aided by Batman and the mysterious Wonder Woman in confronting the monster, but none of them are able to put the creature down. Knowing it's kryptonian, Clark retrieves the kryptonite spear and impales Doomsday with the object, who in response mortally wounds Clark by stabbing him with one of its claws. Two separate funerals are held. Metropolis holds a funeral for Superman, but the Kent farm holds a private one for Clark Kent (which contains his actual body). Martha gives Lois an engagement ring that Clark planned to give to her. The dirt around Clark's casket briefly levitates indicating he may still be alive.\n\nBatman also had a vision at one point in the movie where he leads a rebellion against the forces of Superman in a dystopian future where Clark kills two hostages with his heat vision before killing Batman while saying \"You took her from me.\" A [[Flash (Barry Allen)|mysterious time traveler]] also briefly appears warning him that Lois is the key. Whether or not Batman's vision comes true remains to be seen.\n\n===Marvel Comics cameo===\nClark Kent makes a cameo appearance in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|''Thor'']] #341 (1984; art by Walter Simonson). When Thor asks [[Nick Fury]] to set up a new alternate identity for him since he cannot turn into [[Donald Blake]] anymore, Fury gives him a pair of glasses as a disguise aid, stating, \"It always worked for [[Superman|that other guy]].\" Right afterwards, Thor accidentally bumps into Kent, who is attending a press conference at [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with [[Lois Lane]]. Thanks to the glasses, Kent nearly recognizes Thor, but then (ironically) dismisses the idea.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=6668|title=Clark Kent (III&nbsp;\u2014 Post-Crisis)}}.\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=12424|title=Clark Joseph Kent (Post-Crisis)}}.\n*[http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Clark_Kent Clark Kent] at the Smallville Wiki.\n*[http://superman.nu/wiki/index.php/Clark_Kent Supermanica: Clark Kent]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Superman}}\n{{Superman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kent, Clark}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Shuster]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kansas]]\n[[Category:Fictional farmers]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional players of American football]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Fictional writers]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Superman]]\n[[Category:Superheroes with alter egos]]", "sha1": "mlfins71vr5ktp20h54u61h6hclmfim"}}, {"title": "Classification of finite simple groups", "ns": "0", "id": "7445", "revision": {"id": "861415836", "parentid": "860236868", "timestamp": "2018-09-27T07:47:34Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wqwt", "id": "21740901"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/82.136.67.75|82.136.67.75]] ([[User talk:82.136.67.75|talk]]): Discuss ambiguity on talk page. ([[WP:TW|TW]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Group theory sidebar|Finite}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''classification of the finite [[Simple group|simple groups]]''' is a theorem stating that every [[List of finite simple groups|finite simple group]] belongs to one of four broad classes described below. These [[group (mathematics)|groups]] can be seen as the basic building blocks of all [[finite group]]s, in a way reminiscent of the way the [[prime number]]s are the basic building blocks of the [[natural number]]s.  The [[Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem]] is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups. However, a significant difference from  [[integer factorization]] is that such \"building blocks\" do not necessarily determine  a unique group, since there might be many non-[[isomorphic]] groups with the same [[composition series]] or, put in another way, the [[group extension#Extension problem|extension problem]] does not have a unique solution.\n\n[[Group theory]] is central to many areas of pure and applied mathematics and the classification theorem is one of the great achievements of modern mathematics. The proof consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004. [[Daniel Gorenstein|Gorenstein]] (d.1992), [[Richard Lyons (mathematician)|Lyons]], and [[Ronald Solomon|Solomon]] are gradually publishing a simplified and revised version of the proof.\n\n==Statement of the classification theorem==\n{{Main|List of finite simple groups}}\n{{math_theorem|Every finite [[simple group]] is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n* a member of one of three infinite classes of such, namely:\n** the [[cyclic groups]] of prime order,\n** the [[alternating groups]] of degree at least 5,\n** the [[groups of Lie type]]\n* one of 26 groups called the \"[[sporadic groups]]\"\n* the [[Tits group]] (which is sometimes considered a 27th sporadic group).}}\n\nThe classification theorem has applications in many branches of mathematics, as questions about the structure of [[finite group]]s (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups. Thanks to the classification theorem, such questions can sometimes be answered by checking each family of simple groups and each sporadic group.\n\n[[Daniel Gorenstein]] announced in 1983 that the finite simple groups had all been classified, but this was premature as he had been misinformed about the proof of the classification of [[quasithin group]]s. The completed proof of the classification was announced by {{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} after Aschbacher and Smith published a 1221-page proof for the missing quasithin case.\n\n==Overview of the proof of the classification theorem==\n{{harvs|txt|last=Gorenstein|year1=1982|year2=1983}} wrote two volumes outlining the low rank and odd characteristic part of the proof, and {{harvs|txt| | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Lyons | first2=Richard | last3=Smith | first3=Stephen D. | last4=Solomon | first4=Ronald | title=The Classification of Finite Simple Groups: Groups of Characteristic 2 Type | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&ikey=SURV-172 | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-5336-8 | year=2011 | volume=172}}\nwrote a 3rd volume covering the remaining characteristic 2 case. The proof can be broken up into several major pieces as follows:\n\n===Groups of small 2-rank===\nThe simple groups of low [[rank of a group#Generalizations and related notions|2-rank]] are mostly groups of Lie type of small rank over fields of odd characteristic, together with five alternating and seven characteristic 2 type and nine sporadic groups.\n\nThe simple groups of small 2-rank include:\n*Groups of 2-rank 0, in other words groups of odd order, which are all [[Solvable group|solvable]] by the [[Feit\u2013Thompson theorem]].\n*Groups of 2-rank 1. The Sylow 2-subgroups are either cyclic, which is easy to handle using the transfer map, or generalized [[quaternion]], which are handled with the [[Brauer\u2013Suzuki theorem]]: in particular there are no simple groups of 2-rank 1.\n*Groups of 2-rank 2. Alperin showed that the Sylow subgroup must be dihedral, quasidihedral, wreathed, or a Sylow 2-subgroup of ''U''<sub>3</sub>(4). The first case was done by the [[Gorenstein\u2013Walter theorem]] which showed that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''<sub>2</sub>(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''A''<sub>7</sub>, the second and third cases were done by the [[Alperin\u2013Brauer\u2013Gorenstein theorem]] which implies that the only simple groups are isomorphic to ''L''<sub>3</sub>(''q'') or ''U''<sub>3</sub>(''q'') for ''q'' odd or ''M''<sub>11</sub>, and the last case was done by Lyons who showed that ''U''<sub>3</sub>(4) is the only simple possibility.\n*Groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4, classified by the [[Gorenstein\u2013Harada theorem]].\nThe classification of groups of small 2-rank, especially ranks at most 2, makes heavy use of ordinary and modular character theory, which is almost never directly used elsewhere in the classification.\n\nAll groups not of small 2 rank can be split into two major classes: groups of component type and groups of characteristic 2 type. This is because if a group has sectional 2-rank at least 5 then MacWilliams showed that its Sylow 2-subgroups are connected, and the [[balance theorem]] implies that any simple group with connected Sylow 2-subgroups is either of component type or characteristic 2 type. (For groups of low 2-rank the proof of this breaks down, because theorems such as the [[signalizer functor]] theorem only work for groups with elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 3.)\n\n===Groups of component type===\nA group is said to be of component type if for some centralizer ''C'' of an involution, ''C''/''O''(''C'') has a component (where ''O''(''C'') is the core of ''C'', the maximal normal subgroup of odd order).\nThese are more or less the groups of Lie type of odd characteristic of large rank, and alternating groups, together with some sporadic groups.\nA major step in this case is to eliminate the obstruction of the core of an involution. This is accomplished by the [[B-theorem]], which states that every component of ''C''/''O''(''C'') is the image of a component of ''C''.\n\nThe idea is that these groups have a centralizer of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case and have to be treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.\n\n===Groups of characteristic 2 type===\n\nA group is of characteristic 2 type if the [[generalized Fitting subgroup]] ''F''*(''Y'') of every 2-local subgroup ''Y'' is a 2-group.\nAs the name suggests these are roughly the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2, plus a handful of others that are alternating or sporadic or of odd characteristic. Their classification is divided into the small and large rank cases, where the rank is the largest rank of an odd abelian subgroup normalizing a nontrivial 2-subgroup, which is often (but not always) the same as the rank of a Cartan subalgebra when the group is a group of Lie type in characteristic 2.\n\nThe rank 1 groups are the thin groups, classified by Aschbacher, and the rank 2 ones are the notorious [[quasithin group]]s, classified by Aschbacher and Smith. These correspond roughly to groups of Lie type of ranks 1 or 2 over fields of characteristic 2.\n\nGroups of rank at least 3 are further subdivided into 3 classes by the [[trichotomy theorem]], proved by Aschbacher for rank 3 and by Gorenstein and Lyons for rank at least 4.\nThe three classes are groups of GF(2) type (classified mainly by Timmesfeld), groups of \"standard type\" for some odd prime (classified by the Gilman\u2013Griess theorem and work by several others), and groups of uniqueness type, where a result of Aschbacher implies that there are no simple groups.\nThe general higher rank case consists mostly of the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2 of rank at least 3 or 4.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness of the simple groups===\n\nThe main part of the classification produces a characterization of each simple group. It is then necessary to check that there exists a simple group for each characterization and that it is unique. This gives a large number of separate problems; for example, the original proofs of existence and uniqueness of the [[monster group]] totaled about 200 pages, and the identification of the [[Ree groups]] by Thompson and Bombieri was one of the hardest parts of the classification. Many of the existence proofs and some of the uniqueness proofs for the sporadic groups originally used computer calculations, most of which have since been replaced by shorter hand proofs.\n\n==History of the proof==\n\n===Gorenstein's program===\nIn 1972 {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1979|loc=Appendix}} announced a program for completing the classification of finite simple groups, consisting of the following 16 steps:\n# Groups of low 2-rank. This was essentially done by Gorenstein and Harada, who classified the groups with sectional 2-rank at most 4. Most of the cases of 2-rank at most 2 had been done by the time Gorenstein announced his program.\n# The semisimplicity of 2-layers. The problem is to prove that the 2-layer of the centralizer of an involution in a simple group is semisimple.\n# Standard form in odd characteristic. If a group has an involution with a 2-component that is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic, the goal is to show that it has a centralizer of involution in \"standard form\" meaning that a centralizer of involution has a component that is of Lie type in odd characteristic and also has a centralizer of 2-rank 1.\n# Classification of groups of odd type. The problem is to show that if a group has a centralizer of involution in \"standard form\" then it is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic. This was solved by Aschbacher's [[classical involution theorem]].\n# Quasi-standard form\n# Central involutions\n# Classification of alternating groups.\n# Some sporadic groups\n# Thin groups. The simple [[thin finite groups]], those with 2-local ''p''-rank at most 1 for odd primes ''p'', were classified by Aschbacher in 1978\n# Groups with a strongly p-embedded subgroup for ''p'' odd\n# The signalizer functor method for odd primes. The main problem is to prove a [[signalizer functor]] theorem for nonsolvable signalizer functors. This was solved by McBride in 1982.\n# Groups of characteristic ''p'' type. This is the problem of groups with a strongly ''p''-embedded 2-local subgroup with ''p'' odd, which was handled by Aschbacher.\n# Quasithin groups. A [[quasithin group]] is one whose 2-local subgroups have ''p''-rank at most 2 for all odd primes ''p'', and the problem is to classify the simple ones of characteristic 2 type. This was completed by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.\n# Groups of low 2-local 3-rank. This was essentially solved by Aschbacher's [[trichotomy theorem]] for groups with ''e''(''G'')=3. The main change is that 2-local 3-rank is replaced by 2-local ''p''-rank for odd primes.\n# Centralizers of 3-elements in standard form. This was essentially done by the [[Trichotomy theorem]].\n# Classification of simple groups of characteristic 2 type. This was handled by the [[Gilman\u2013Griess theorem]], with 3-elements replaced by ''p''-elements for odd primes.\n\n===Timeline of the proof===\n\nMany of the items in the list below are taken from {{harvtxt|Solomon|2001}}.

Because of the extreme length of the first generation proof, much effort has been devoted to finding a simpler proof, called a '''second-generation classification proof'''. This effort, called \"revisionism\", was originally led by [[Daniel Gorenstein]].\n\n{{As of|2018}}, seven volumes of the second generation proof have been published {{harvs|last=Gorenstein|last2=Lyons|last3=Solomon|year1=1994|year2=1996|year3=1998|year4=1999|year5=2002|year6=2005|year7=2018}}. In 2012 Solomon estimated that the project would need another 5 volumes, but said that progress on them was slow. It is estimated that the new proof will eventually fill approximately 5,000 pages. (This length stems in part from second generation proof being written in a more relaxed style.) Aschbacher and Smith wrote their two volumes devoted to the quasithin case in such a way that those volumes can be part of the second generation proof.\n\nGorenstein and his collaborators have given several reasons why a simpler proof is possible.\n* The most important is that the correct, final statement of the theorem is now known. Simpler techniques can be applied that are known to be adequate for the types of groups we know to be finite simple. In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the [[Janko group]]s) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.\n*Because the conclusion was unknown, the first generation proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much of the work of proving these theorems was devoted to the analysis of numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.\n*Many first generation theorems overlap, and so divide the possible cases in inefficient ways. As a result, families and subfamiles of finite simple groups were identified multiple times. The revised proof eliminates these redundancies by relying on a different subdivision of cases.\n*Finite group theorists have more experience at this sort of exercise, and have new techniques at their disposal.\n\n{{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2004}} has called the work on the classification problem by Ulrich Meierfrankenfeld, Bernd Stellmacher, Gernot Stroth, and a few others, a '''third generation program'''. One goal of this is to treat all groups in characteristic 2 uniformly using the amalgam method.\n\n===Why is the proof so long?===\n\nGorenstein has discussed some of the reasons why there might not be a short proof of the classification similar to the classification of [[compact Lie group]]s.\n\n*The most obvious reason is that the list of simple groups is quite complicated: with 26 sporadic groups there are likely to be many special cases that have to be considered in any proof. So far no one has yet found a clean uniform description of the finite simple groups similar to the parameterization of the compact Lie groups by [[Dynkin diagram]]s.\n*Atiyah and others have suggested that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as [[BN-pair]]s, but this only comes at the end of a very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.\n*Another suggestion for simplifying the proof is to make greater use of [[representation theory]]. The problem here is that representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In the early days of the classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.\n\n==Consequences of the classification==\n\nThis section lists some results that have been proved using the classification of finite simple groups.\n\n*The [[Schreier conjecture]]\n*The [[Signalizer functor theorem]]\n*The [[B conjecture]]\n*The [[Schur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem]] for all groups (though this only uses the [[Feit\u2013Thompson theorem]]).\n*A transitive permutation group on a finite set with more than 1 element has a fixed-point-free element of prime power order.\n*The classification of [[multiple transitivity|2-transitive permutation groups]].\n*The classification of [[rank 3 permutation group]]s.\n*The [[Sims conjecture]]\n*[[Frobenius's theorem (group theory)|Frobenius's conjecture]] on the number of solutions of {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> = 1}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[O'Nan\u2013Scott theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite news | first = Michael | last = Aschbacher | authorlink = Michael Aschbacher | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200407/fea-aschbacher.pdf | title = The Status of the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume = 51 | issue = 7 | pages = 736\u2013740 | ref=harv}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Lyons | first2=Richard | last3=Smith | first3=Stephen D. | last4=Solomon | first4=Ronald | title=The Classification of Finite Simple Groups: Groups of Characteristic 2 Type | url=http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&ikey=SURV-172 | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-5336-8 | year=2011 | volume=172}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Conway |first1=John Horton |authorlink1=John Horton Conway |last2=Curtis |first2=Robert Turner |last3=Norton |first3=Simon Phillips |authorlink3=Simon P.

In the context of [[Eastern Europe]]an archaeology, the term Eneolithic is often preferred to Chalcolithic and other alternatives.\n\nThe Chalcolithic was a period in which [[copper]] is predominant in [[metalworking]] technology. Hence it was the period before it was discovered that adding [[tin]] to copper formed [[bronze]] (a harder and stronger metal). The archaeological site of [[Belovode]], on the mountain of [[Rudnik (mountain)|Rudnik mountain]] in [[Serbia]] has the oldest securely-dated evidence of [[copper smelting]], from 7000 [[Before Present|BP]] (5000 BCE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20100924|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|publisher=UCL Institute of Archaeology|date=23 September 2010|website=UCL.ac.uk|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"archaeology.ws\">{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|author=Bruce Bower|date=July 17, 2010|work=ScienceNews|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Copper Age in the [[Ancient Near East]]   began in the late [[5th millennium BCE]] and lasted for about a millennium before it gave rise to the [[Early Bronze Age]]. \nThe transition from the European Copper Age to [[Bronze Age Europe]] occurs about the same time, between the late 5th and the late [[3rd millennium BCE|3rd millennia BCE]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe multiple names result from multiple recognitions of the period. Originally, the term [[Bronze Age]] meant that either copper or bronze was being used as the chief hard substance for the manufacture of tools and weapons.\n\nIn 1881, [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] recognized that use of copper often preceded the use of bronze, and distinguished between a ''transitional Copper Age'' and the ''Bronze Age proper''. He did not include the transitional period in the [[three-age system]] of Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age, but placed it outside the tripartite system, at its beginning. He did not, however, present it as a fourth age but chose to retain the traditional tripartite system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1884, [[Gaetano Chierici]], perhaps following the lead of Evans, renamed it in [[Italy|Italian]] as the ''eneo-litica'', or \"bronze\u2013stone\" transition. The phrase was never intended to mean that the period was the only one in which both bronze and stone were used. The Copper Age features the use of copper, excluding bronze; moreover, stone continued to be used throughout both the Bronze Age and the [[Iron Age]]. The part ''-litica'' simply names the Stone Age as the point from which the transition began and is not another ''-lithic'' age.\n\nSubsequently, British scholars used either Evans's \"Copper Age\" or the term \"Eneolithic\" (or \u00c6neolithic), a translation of Chierici's ''eneo-litica''. After several years, a number of complaints appeared in the literature that \"Eneolithic\" seemed to the untrained eye to be produced from ''e-neolithic'', \"outside the Neolithic\", clearly not a definitive characterization of the Copper Age. Around 1900, many writers began to substitute ''Chalcolithic'' for Eneolithic, to avoid the false segmentation. It was then that the misunderstanding began among those who did not know Italian. The Chalcolithic was seen as a new ''-lithic'' age, a part of the [[Stone Age]] in which copper was used, which may appear paradoxical. Today, ''Copper Age'', ''Eneolithic'' and ''Chalcolithic'' are used synonymously to mean Evans's original definition of Copper Age.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The literature of European archaeology in general avoids the use of \"Chalcolithic\" (the term \"Copper Age\" is preferred), whereas [[Middle East]]ern archaeologists regularly use it. \"Chalcolithic\" is not generally used by British prehistorians, who disagree as to whether it applies in the British context.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/oxbow/is-there-a-british-chalcolithic.html|title=Is There a British Chalcolithic?: People, Place and Polity in the later Third Millennium (summary)|publisher=Oxbow|year=2012|isbn=9781842174968|editors=Allen, Michael J. et al}}</ref>\n==Near East==\n[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]]]]\n\nThe emergence of [[metallurgy]] may have occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]].

Early metallurgy is also documented at the nearby site of [[Tell Maghzaliyah]], which seems to be dated even earlier, and completely lacks pottery.\n\n\nAnalysis of stone tool assemblages from sites on the [[Tehran Plain]], in Iran, has illustrated the effects of the introduction of copper working technologies on the in-place systems of lithic craft specialists and raw materials. Networks of exchange and specialized processing and production that had evolved during the Neolithic seem to have collapsed by the Middle Chalcolithic ({{circa}} 4500\u20133500&nbsp;BCE) and been replaced by the use of local materials by a primarily household-based production of stone tools.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=H.|last2=Donahue|first2=R.E.|last3=Coningham|first3=R.A.E.|title=Stone Tool Production, Distribution and Use during the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic on the Tehran Plain, Iran|journal=Journal of Persian Studies|date=2002|volume=40|pages=1\u201314|jstor=4300616}}</ref>\n\n\nThe [[Timna Valley]] contains evidence of copper mining in 7000\u20135000&nbsp;BCE.

This dramatic shift is seen throughout the region, including the [[Tehran]] Plain, [[Iran]]. Here, analysis of six archaeological sites determined a marked downward trend in not only material quality, but also in aesthetic variation in the lithic artefacts.

In modern states, circumcision is generally presumed to be legal, but laws pertaining to assault or child custody have been applied in cases involving circumcision. There are currently no states that unequivocally ban infant male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons. In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision of children, proponents of laws in favor of the procedure often point to the rights of the parents or practitioners, namely the right of freedom to religion.

The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without [[medical necessity]]; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible.

It was ratified by the ELCA in 1999, the ECUSA in 2000, after the narrow failure of a previous agreement. Its principal author on the Episcopal side was theological professor [[J. Robert Wright]].  Under the agreement, they recognize the validity of each other's [[baptism]]s and [[ordination]]s. The agreement provided that the ELCA would accept the [[historical episcopate]] and the \"threefold ministry\" of [[Bishop]] - [[Priest]] (or [[Pastor]]) - [[Deacon]] with respect to ministers of communicant churches serving ELCA congregations. This provision was opposed by some in the ELCA, which after its founding merger in 1988, held a lengthy study of the ministry which was undertaken with divided opinions.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In response to concerns about the meaning of the CCM, synod bishops in the ELCA drafted the Tucson resolution<ref> [http://wordalone.org/docs/wa-tucson-resolution.shtml Tucson Resolution (dead link)] archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142844/http://wordalone.org/docs/wa-tucson-resolution.shtml Internet Archive] retrieved August 28, 2018</ref> which presented the official ELCA position. It made clear that there is no requirement to ordain deacons or accept their ministry. It also provided assurance that the ELCA did not and was not required by CCM to change its own theological stance. \n\nSome  within the ELCA argued that the historical episcopate would contradict the traditional [[Lutheran doctrine]] that the church exists wherever the Word is preached and Sacraments are practiced. The traditional ELCA doctrine is affirmed by the Tuscon resolution. Others objected on the grounds that adopting the Episcopal / Anglican view on priestly orders and  hierarchical structure was contrary to the [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheran]] concept of the \"[[priesthood of all believers]]\", which holds that all Christians stand on equal footing before God. They argued that the [[Old Covenant]] required a priest to mediate between God and humanity, but that [[New Covenant]] explicitly abolishes the need for priestly role by making every Christian a priest with direct access to God's grace. The Tucson resolution explained that the ELCA had not adopted the Episcopal view, but ECUSA or Reformed ordinands accepted by ELCA congregations would follow ELCA practice.  Still others objected because of the implied directive that the use of a [[lay presidency]] would be abolished. This was a particularly issue for rural congregations that periodically \"called\" a congregation member to conduct communion services consecrating the elements (of bread and wine for service)  in the interim period or with the absence of ordained clergy (pastor).{{cn|date=August 2018}} The Tuscon resolution explicitly affirmed the continued use of lay ministry.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lutheranism]]\n*[[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]]\n*[[Anglicanism]]\n*[[Porvoo Communion]]\n*[[Waterloo Declaration]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.episcopalchurch.org/page/agreement-full-communion-called-common-mission Text of the agreement]\n*[http://lutheran-episcopal.org The Lutheran-Episcopal Coordinating Committee]\n\n[[Category:Protestant ecumenism]]\n[[Category:Episcopal Church (United States)]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n[[Category:20th-century Lutheranism]]\n[[Category:Anglican ecumenism]]\n[[Category:1999 in Christianity]]\n\n\n{{Anglican-stub}}\n{{Lutheran-stub}}", "sha1": "hvosdyb6wc3lfjet2nf9fnb11b09sxj"}}, {"title": "Context menu", "ns": "0", "id": "7450", "revision": {"id": "851795475", "parentid": "851713700", "timestamp": "2018-07-24T17:13:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Guy Harris", "id": "122189"}, "comment": "/* See also */ The article is called [[Menu key]], not [[Menu_key]] - don't confuse the name in the URL with the name of the page, Wikipedia uses underscore rather than %20 to represent blanks in page names.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}\n[[Image:Menu key screen.jpg|thumb|233px|right|Context menu from [[Mozilla Firefox]], shown in the context of a web page]]\n[[Image:Context menu windows.png|thumb|233px|right|Context menus in [[Windows 10]] are customizable by third-party software.]]\n[[Image:Context_Menu_on_OS_X_10.9.png|thumb|233px|right|Finder context menu in [[macOS]]]]\n[[Image:Context menu.png|thumb|233px|right|[[GNOME]] context menu]]\nA '''context menu''' (also called '''contextual''', '''shortcut''', and '''pop up''' or '''pop-up''' '''menu''') is a [[Menu (computing)|menu]] in a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click [[Mouse (computing)#Operation|mouse operation]]. A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. Usually the available choices are actions related to the [[Selection (user interface)|selected object]]. From a technical point of view, such a context menu is a [[graphical control element (software)|graphical control element]].\n\n==History==\nContext menus first appeared in the [[Smalltalk]] environment on the [[Xerox Alto]] computer, where they were called ''pop-up menus''; they were invented by [[Dan Ingalls]] in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auAXfVwNAJoC&pg=PA252&dq=Dan+Ingalls+pop+up+menu#v=onepage&q=Dan%20Ingalls%20pop%20up%20menu&f=false |title=Explaining Creativity: The Science of Human Innovation |author=R.

[[Lotus 1-2-3]]/G for [[OS/2]] v1.0 added additional formatting options in 1991. Borland [[Quattro Pro]] for Windows v1.0 introduced the Properties context menu option in 1992.\n\n==Implementation==\nContext menus are opened via various forms of user interaction that target a region of the GUI that supports context menus. The specific form of user interaction and the means by which a region is targeted vary:\n* On a computer running [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], or [[Unix]] running the [[X Window System]], clicking the secondary mouse button (usually the right button) opens a context menu for the region that is under the mouse pointer.\n* On systems that support one-button mice, context menus are typically opened by pressing and holding the primary mouse button (this works on the icons in the Dock on [[macOS]]) or by pressing a keyboard/mouse button combination (e.g. Ctrl-mouse click in [[Classic Mac OS]] and macOS). A keyboard alternative for macOS is to enable [[Mouse keys]] in [[Universal Access]]. Then, depending on whether a laptop or compact or extended keyboard type is used, the shortcut is {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 or {{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 (numeric keypad) or {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+i (laptop).\n* On systems with a [[multi-touch]] interface such as MacBook or Surface, the context menu can be opened by pressing or tapping with two fingers instead of just one.\nWindows mouse click behavior is such that the context menu doesn't open while the mouse button is pressed, but only opens the menu when the button is released, so the user has to click again (this time with the first mouse button) to select a context menu item. This behavior differs from that of macOS and most free software GUIs.\n* In Microsoft Windows, pressing the [[Menu key|Application key]] or Shift+F10 opens a context menu for the region that has [[Focus (computing)|focus]].\n\nContext menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. The implementations differ: [[Microsoft Word]] was one of the first applications to only show sub-entries of some menu entries after clicking an arrow icon on the context menu, otherwise executing an action associated with the parent entry. This makes it possible to quickly repeat an action with the parameters of the previous execution, and to better separate options from actions.\n\n=== X Window Managers ===\n\nThe following [[window manager]]s provide context menu functionality:\n\n* [[9wm]]\n* [[IceWM]] - [[middleclick]] and [[rightclick]] context menus on [[Desktop environment|desktop]], [[menubar]]. [[titlebar]]s, and [[titleicon]]\n* [[olwm]]\n* [[openbox]]\n* [[Sawfish (window manager)|sawfish]]\n\n==Usability==\nContext menus have received some criticism from [[usability]] analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features ''only'' available in context menus, which may confuse even experienced users (especially when the context menus can only be activated in a limited area of the application's client window).\n\nContext menus usually open in a fixed position under the [[Elements of graphical user interfaces#Pointer|pointer]], but when the pointer is near a screen edge the menu will be displaced - thus reducing consistency and impeding use of [[muscle memory]]. If the context menu is being triggered by keyboard, such as by using Shift + F10, the context menu appears near the focused widget instead of the position of the pointer, to save recognition efforts.\n\n==In documentation==\nMicrosoft's guidelines call for always using the term ''context menu'', and explicitly deprecate ''shortcut menu''.<ref name=\"msmenu\">{{cite web|year=2011|title=Menus|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742392.aspx|work=Windows desktop applications - Guidelines|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pie menu]]\n*[[Screen hotspot]]\n*[[Menu key]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Graphical control elements}}\n\n[[Category:Graphical user interface elements]]\n[[Category:Graphical control elements]]\n[[Category:Windows administration]]\n[[Category:Mac OS user interface]]", "sha1": "0qd1nid6c7ajj5erpder61y30l77g1u"}}, {"title": "Jews as the chosen people", "ns": "0", "id": "7451", "revision": {"id": "865576103", "parentid": "865545507", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T19:32:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05df", "id": "33185242"}, "comment": "red template", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}}\n{{Jewish philosophy}}\nIn [[Judaism]], \"chosenness\" is the belief that the [[Jews]], via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the [[chosen people]], i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]].

The three largest Jewish denominations\u2014[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]\u2014maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission\u2014to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the [[Torah]].\n\nThis view, however, did not preclude a belief that [[God]] has a relationship with other peoples\u2014rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  [[Moses]] refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|27:16|HE}}), and the [[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew Bible]]) also identifies [[prophet]]s outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of [[Nethanel ibn Fayyumi]], a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...<nowiki>[and]</nowiki> God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966)  The [[Mishnah]] states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human, not Jewish, life, has done the same (save or kill) to an entire world. The [[Tosefta]], an important supplement to the Mishnah<ref>(see Wikipedia \"Tosefta\")</ref>, also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the [[Olam Haba|world to come]]\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nAccording to the [[Israel Democracy Institute]], approximately two thirds of [[Israeli Jews]] believe that Jews are the \"chosen people\".<ref>[http://en.idi.org.il/media/2720081/Democracy%20Index%20English%202013.pdf 2013 Democracy Index], \"We asked: \u201cTo what extent do you believe that the Jews are the \u2018chosen people\u2019?\u201d As shown in Figure 34, roughly two thirds of the Jewish respondents (64.3%) believe \u201cvery strongly\u201d or \u201cquite strongly\u201d that the Jews are indeed the chosen people, while one third (32.7%) do not share this view.\"</ref>\n\n==In the Bible==\nAccording to the Bible, Israel's character as the chosen people is unconditional as it says in {{Bible verse||Deuteronomy|14:2|HE}},\n:\"For you are a holy people to [[YHWH]] your God, and God has chosen you to be his treasured people from all the nations that are on the face of the earth.\"\n\n[[File:136.The Prophet Amos.jpg|thumb|Prophet Amos as depicted by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nThe Torah also says,\n:\"Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from all the peoples, for all the earth is mine\" ({{Bible verse||Exodus|19:5|HE}}).\nGod promises that he will never exchange his people with any other:\n:\"And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.\" [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2017:7&version=NKJV (Genesis 17:7)].\n\nOther Torah verses about chosenness,\n*\"And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation\" ({{Bible verse||Exodus|19:6|HE}}).\n*\"The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people; but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors.\" ({{Bible verse||Deuteronomy|7:7\u20138|HE}}).\n\nThe obligation imposed upon the Israelites was emphasized by the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Amos|3:2|HE}}):\n:\"You only have I singled out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.\"\n\n==Rabbinic views==\n\nSometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission\u2014to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.  This view, however, did not preclude a belief that [[God]] has a relationship with other peoples\u2014rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God.\nBiblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view:  Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|27:16|HE}}), and the [[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew Bible]]) also identifies [[prophet]]s outside the community of Israel.

The Tosefta, a collection of important post-Talmudic discourses, also states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the [[Olam Haba|world to come]]\" (Sanhedrin 105a).\n\nMost Jewish texts do not state that \"God chose the Jews\" by itself. Rather, this is usually linked with a mission or purpose, such as proclaiming God's message among all the nations, even though Jews cannot become \"unchosen\" if they shirk their mission. This implies a special duty, which evolves from the belief that Jews have been pledged by the covenant which God concluded with the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], their ancestor, and again with the entire Jewish nation at [[Mount Sinai]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/chosen-people \"Chosen people.\"] ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.  20 February 2018.</ref> In this view, Jews are charged with living a holy life as God's priest-people.\n\nIn the [[Siddur|Jewish prayerbook (the Siddur)]], chosenness is referred to in a number of ways. The blessing for reading the [[Torah]] reads, \"Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us His Torah.\" In the \"[[Kiddush]]\", a prayer of sanctification, in which the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] is inaugurated over a cup of wine, the text reads, \"For you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations, and have given us the Sabbath as an inheritance in love and favour. Praised are you, Lord, who hallows the Sabbath.\" In the \"Kiddush\" recited on festivals it reads, \"Blessed are You ... who have chosen us from among all nations, raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments.\" The [[Aleinu]] prayer refers to the concept of Jews as a chosen people: <blockquote>\"It is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude.

The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.\"<ref>qtd. in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr4_nhEmtcAC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=%22%22Yes,+I+do+believe+that+the+chosen+people+concept+as+affirmed+by+Judaism+in+its+holy+writ,+its+prayers,+and+its+millennial+tradition.%22&source=bl&ots=CgRAued75m&sig=Z6jain4ueaEkX5Jh0cyDXJXbzhc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjm3JCnkKvZAhUkKsAKHSq7Dw0Q6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&q=%22%22Yes%2C%20I%20do%20believe%20that%20the%20chosen%20people%20concept%20as%20affirmed%20by%20Judaism%20in%20its%20holy%20writ%2C%20its%20prayers%2C%20and%20its%20millennial%20tradition.%22&f=false Mackenzie]</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Michael wyschogrod head shot2.jpg|thumbnail|Michael Wyschogrod]]\nModern Orthodox theologian [[Michael Wyschogrod]] wrote: <blockquote>\"[T]he initial election of [[Abraham]] himself was not earned.  ...

The Torah and the Prophets clearly stated that this does not imply any innate Jewish superiority.  In the words of Amos (3:2) 'You alone have I singled out of all the families of the earth\u2014that is why I will call you to account for your iniquities.' The Torah tells us that we are to be \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" with obligations and duties which flowed from our willingness to accept this status. Far from being a license for special privilege, it entailed additional responsibilities not only toward God but to our fellow human beings. As expressed in the blessing at the reading of the Torah, our people have always felt it to be a privilege to be selected for such a purpose. For the modern traditional Jew, the doctrine of the election and the covenant of Israel offers a purpose for Jewish existence which transcends its own self interests. It suggests that because of our special history and unique heritage we are in a position to demonstrate that a people that takes seriously the idea of being covenanted with God can not only thrive in the face of oppression, but can be a source of blessing to its children and its neighbors. It obligates us to build a just and compassionate society throughout the world and especially in the [[land of Israel]] where we may teach by example what it means to be a 'covenant people, a light unto the nations.'\"<ref>''Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism'', JTSA, New York, 1988, p.33\u201334</ref></blockquote>\n\nRabbi [[Reuven Hammer]] comments on the excised sentence in the Aleinu prayer mentioned above: <blockquote>\"Originally the text read that God has not made us like the nations who \"bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an impotent god\", [...] In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends to give the impression that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.\"<ref>Reuven Hammer, ''Or Hadash'', The Rabbinical Assembly, New York, 2003</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reform views==\n[[Reform Judaism]] views the concept of chosenness in this way: \"Throughout the ages it has been Israel's mission to witness to the Divine in the face of every form of paganism and materialism. We regard it as our historic task to cooperate with all men in the establishment of the kingdom of God, of universal brotherhood, Justice, truth and peace on earth. This is our Messianic goal.\"<ref>''The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism'', Columbus, [[Ohio]], 1937</ref> In 1999 the Reform movement stated, \"We affirm that the Jewish people are bound to God by an eternal covenant, as reflected in our varied understandings of Creation, Revelation and Redemption [...] We are Israel, a people aspiring to holiness, singled out through our ancient covenant and our unique history among the nations to be witnesses to God's presence. We are linked by that covenant and that history to all Jews in every age and place.\"<ref>''Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism'', adopted at the 1999 [[Pittsburgh]] Convention, Central Conference of American Rabbis</ref>\n\n==Alternative views==\n{{see also|Kabbalah#Distinction between Jews and non-Jews}}\n\n===Equality of souls===\n[[File:Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson2 crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Chest high portrait of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson wearing a black hat|upright|Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], known as ''\"the Lubavitcher Rebbe\"'']]\nMany [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources, notably the [[Tanya]], contain statements to the effect that the Jewish soul is qualitatively different from the non-Jewish soul.  A number of known [[Chabad]] rabbis offered alternative readings of the Tanya, did not take this teaching literally, and even managed to reconcile it with the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] ideas of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[class struggle]]. The original text of the Tanya refers to the \"idol worshippers\" and does not mention the \"nations of the world\" at all, although such interpretation was endorsed by [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] and is popular in contemporary Chabad circles. [[Hillel of Parich]], an early Tanya commentator, wrote that the souls of righteous Gentiles are more similar to the Jewish souls, and are generally good and not egoistic. This teaching was accepted by Schneerson and is considered normative in Chabad.<ref>Lessons in Tanya, Vol. 1, Ch. 1</ref>\n\n====Different in character but not value====\nAccording to the author of the Tanya himself, a righteous non-Jew can achieve a high level of spiritually, similar to an angel, although his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one.<ref>\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1, \u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05de\u05e6\u05d4</ref> [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn|Tzemach Tzedek]], the third rebbe of Chabad, wrote that the [[Islam|Muslims]] are naturally good-hearted people. Rabbi Yosef Jacobson, a popular contemporary Chabad lecturer, teaches that in today's world most non-Jews belong to the category of righteous Gentiles, effectively rendering the Tanya's attitude anachronistic.\n\nDov Ber Pinson, a contemporary Chabad mystic, denies the idea that there is any essential difference between the Jews and non-Jews. According to his theory, every person has a lower animalistic and higher Godly soul. The Tanya does not talk about Jews and non-Jews as social groups, but describes the internal struggle between the materialistic \"Gentile\" and spiritual \"Jewish\" levels of consciousness within every human soul.<ref>Dov Ber Pinson, Reincarnation and Judaism</ref>\n\n====Altruism====\nAn [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] interpretation of Tanya was offered by [[Abraham Yehudah Khein]], a prominent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Chabad rabbi, who supported [[anarchist communism]] and considered [[Peter Kropotkin]] a great [[Tzaddik]]. Khein basically read the Tanya backwards; since the souls of idol worshipers are known to be evil, according to the Tanya, while the Jewish souls are known to be good, he concluded that truly altruistic people are really Jewish, in a spiritual sense, while Jewish nationalists and class oppressors are not. By this logic, he claimed that [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] probably have Jewish souls, while [[Leon Trotsky]] and other totalitarians do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to [[ape]]s, are merely \"Jewish by birth certificate\".<ref>\u05e8' \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d7\u05df, \u05d1\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea (Rabbi Abraham Chen, \"In the Kingdom of Judaism\")</ref>\n\n====Righteous non-Jews====\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] also believed that Jewishness is a level of consciousness, and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the [[Book of Malachi]], one can find \"potential Jews\" among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of \"holy faith\", which \"activated\" the Jewishness in their soul. These people would otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so. Instead, they recognize the Divine unity within their pagan religions.<ref>Likutei Moharan, Part 2 ,5</ref>\n\n[[Isaac ben Moses Arama|Isaac Arama]], an influential philosopher and mystic of the 15th century, believed that righteous non-Jews are spiritually identical to the righteous Jews.<ref>Isaac Arama, Akedat Yitzchak, Ch. 60</ref> Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]], a famous [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Talmud]]ic commentator and [[Maimonides|Maimonidian]] philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, to be part of a greater \"spiritual Israel\". He explicitly included Christians and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who had no sense of morality. The only exceptions are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.\n\nMeiri applied his idea of \"spiritual Israel\" to the Talmudic statements about unique qualities of the Jewish people. For example, he believed that the famous saying that Israel is above astrological predestination (''Ein Mazal le-Israel'') also applied to the followers of other ethical faiths. He also considered countries, inhabited by decent moral non-Jews, such as [[Languedoc]], as a spiritual part of the [[Holy Land]].<ref>Gregg Stern.

Routledge Jewish Studies Series</ref>\n\n===Spinoza===\n[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|180px|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]\nOne Jewish critic of chosenness was the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]].<ref>Levy,\n Zeev.  [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/spinoza-and-the-philosophical-impossibility-of-a-chosen-people/ \"Spinoza and the Philosophical Impossibility of a Chosen People.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''.  1993.  20 February 2018.</ref> In the third chapter of his ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', Spinoza mounts an argument against a naive interpretation of God's choice of the Jews. Bringing evidence from the [[Bible]] itself, he argues that God's choice of Israel was not unique (he had chosen other nations before choosing the Hebrew nation) and that the choice of the Jews is neither inclusive (it does not include all of the Jews, but only the 'pious' ones) nor exclusive (it also includes 'true gentile prophets'). Finally, he argues that God's choice is not unconditional. Recalling the numerous times God threatened the complete destruction of the Hebrew nation, he asserts that this choice is neither absolute, nor eternal, nor necessary.\n\n==Reconstructionist criticism==\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] rejects the concept of chosenness. Its founder, Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]], said that the idea that God chose the Jewish people leads to [[racist]] beliefs among Jews, and thus must be excised from Jewish theology. This rejection of chosenness is made explicit in the movement's [[siddur]]im (prayer books).  For example, the original blessing recited before reading from the Torah contains the phrase, \"asher bahar banu mikol ha\u2019amim\"\u2014\"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, ''who has chosen us from among all peoples'' by giving us the Torah.\"  The Reconstructionist version is rewritten as \"asher kervanu la\u2019avodato\", \"Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, ''who has drawn us to your service'' by giving us the Torah.\" In the mid-1980s, the Reconstructionist movement issued its ''Platform on Reconstructionism''. It states that the idea of chosenness is \"morally untenable\", because anyone who has such beliefs \"implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others.\"<ref>Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, newsletter, September 1986, pages D, E.</ref>\n\nNot all Reconstructionists accept this view.  The newest siddur of the movement, ''Kol Haneshamah'', includes the traditional blessings as an option, and some modern Reconstructionist writers have opined that the traditional formulation is not racist, and should be embraced.<ref>e.g. Mitchell Max, ''The Chosen People: Reclaiming Our Sacred Myth''</ref>\n\nAn original prayer book, by Reconstructionist feminist poet [[Marcia Falk]], ''The Book of Blessings'', has been widely accepted by both Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Falk rejects all concepts relating to hierarchy or distinction; she sees any distinction as leading to the acceptance of other kinds of distinctions, thus leading to prejudice. She writes that as a politically liberal feminist, she must reject distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, Jews and non-Jews, and to some extent even distinctions between the Sabbath and the other six days of the week. She thus rejects the idea of chosenness as unethical. She also rejects Jewish theology in general, and instead holds to a form of religious humanism. Falk writes: <blockquote>\"The idea of Israel as God's chosen people [...] is a key concept in rabbinic Judaism. Yet it is particularly problematic for many Jews today, in that it seems to fly in the face of monotheistic belief that all humanity is created in the divine image\u2014and hence, all humanity is equally loved and valued by God [...] I find it difficult to conceive of a feminist Judaism that would incorporate it in its teaching: the valuing of one people ''over and above'' others is all too analogous to the privileging of one sex over another.\"<ref>Falk, 1996</ref></blockquote> Reconstructionist author [[Judith Plaskow]] also criticises the idea of chosenness, for many of the same reasons as Falk. A politically liberal lesbian, Plaskow rejects most distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, and Jews and non-Jews. In contrast to Falk, Plaskow does not reject all concepts of difference as inherently leading to unethical beliefs, and holds to a more classical form of Jewish theism than Falk.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nA number of responses to these views have been made by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain [[Haredi]] communities, such as [[Chabad]]). A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms of Judaism in all denominations of Judaism, which do not have a problem with the concepts of chosenness.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Views from other religions==\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Islamic-Jewish relations}}\nThe children of Israel enjoy a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran (2:47 and 2:122)<ref>http://www.askmusa.org/site/c.ehLKKZPJLuF/b.3125653/k.7027/The_Jews_and_the_Quran.htm</ref> However, Muslim scholars point out that this status did not confer upon Israelites any racial superiority, and was only valid so long as the Israelites maintain their covenant with God:<ref>M.

Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam has neither reversed nor reformed its theology concerning the succession of both the Jews and the Christians. According to Beker, this presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<ref>Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Macmilan, 2008, Preface</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Ethnocentrism==\nIsraeli philosopher Ze\u2019ev Levy<!-- notable, has page in he and de wikis --> writes that chosenness can be \"(partially) justified only from the historical angle\" with respect to its spiritual and moral contribution to Jewish life through the centuries, \"a powerful agent of consolation and hope\".

It is shaped by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire, featuring summer-drought-tolerant plants with hard [[sclerophyllous]] evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft-leaved, [[drought-deciduous]], [[scrubland|scrub]] community of [[coastal sage scrub]], found below the chaparral biome.

Mature chaparral (stands that have survived for greater intervals between fires) is characterized by nearly impenetrable, dense thickets (except the more open chaparral of the desert).  These plants are highly flammable during the late summer and autumn months when conditions are characteristically hot and dry.  They grow as woody shrubs with thick, leathery, and often small leaves, contain green leaves all year (are evergreen), and are typically drought resistant (with some exceptions<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venturas|first=Martin D.|last2=MacKinnon|first2=Evan D.|last3=Dario|first3=Hannah L.|last4=Jacobsen|first4=Anna L.|last5=Pratt|first5=R.

The Chaparral area receives about {{convert|38|\u2013|100|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year. This makes the chaparral most vulnerable to fire in the late summer and fall.\n\nThe chaparral ecosystem as a whole is adapted to be able to recover from infrequent wildfires (fires occurring a minimum of 15 years apart); indeed, chaparral regions are known culturally and historically for their impressive fires. (This does create a conflict with human development adjacent to and expanding into chaparral systems.) Additionally, Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/614708491|title=Fire, native peoples, and the natural landscape|date=2002|publisher=Island Press|others=Vale, Thomas R., 1943-|isbn=9781559638890|location=Washington, DC|oclc=614708491}}</ref> Before a major fire, typical chaparral plant communities are dominated by [[manzanita]], chamise (also called greasewood; ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]'') and ''[[Ceanothus]]'' species, [[toyon]] (which can sometimes be interspersed with [[California scrub oak|scrub oak]]s), and other drought-resistant shrubs with hard ([[sclerophyllous]]) leaves; these plants resprout (see [[resprouter]]) from underground [[burl]]s after a fire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The shoots of these plants are, however, not resistant to chaparral crown-fire regimes as the bark is simply not thick enough. Plants that are long-lived in the seed bank or serotenous with induced germination after fire include chamise'', Ceanothus,'' and fiddleneck''.'' Some chaparral plant communities may grow so dense and tall that it becomes difficult for large animals and humans to penetrate, but may be teeming with smaller fauna in the understory. Many chaparral plant species require some fire cue (heat, smoke, or charred wood, and chemical changes in the soil following fires) for germination. Others, such as annual and herbaceous species like ''[[Phacelia]]'' require fires to allow sunlight to reach them, and are known as [[fire follower]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} During the time shortly after a fire, chaparral communities may contain soft-leaved herbaceuous annual plants that dominate the community for the first few years \u2013 until the burl resprouts and seedlings of chaparral perennials create an overstory, blocking the sunlight from other plants in the community. When the overstory regrows, seeds of annuals and smaller plants may lie dormant until the next fire creates the conditions required for germination. Mid-sized plants such as ''Ceonothus'' fix nitrogen, while others cannot, which, together with the need for exposure to the sun, creates a symbiotic relationship of the entire community with infrequent fires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nBecause of the hot, dry conditions that exist in the California summer and fall, chaparral is one of the most fire-prone plant communities in North America. Some fires are caused by lightning, but these are usually during periods of high humidity and low winds and are easily controlled. Nearly all of the very large wildfires are caused by human activity during periods of very hot, dry easterly [[Santa Ana winds]]. These man-made fires are commonly caused by power line failures, vehicle fires and collisions, sparks from machinery, arson, or campfires. In natural Chaparral communities without human interference, the fires are ignition-prone as there are plenty of ground fuels and the temperatures are fire-permitting during the dry season.\n\nThough adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be exterminated by frequent fires. A moderate frequency of fire (less than ten years) will result in the loss of seeder plants such as [[wikipedia:Manzanita|''Manzanita'' spp.]] This moderate frequency disallows seeder plants to reach their reproductive size before the next fire and the community shifts to a sprouter-dominance. High frequency fires (less than five years) can cause the additional loss of sprouters by exhausting their reserves below-ground. Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to non-native annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under drought brought about by climate change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Syphard|first=Alexandra D.|last2=Radeloff|first2=Volker C.|last3=Keeley|first3=Jon E.|last4=Hawbaker|first4=Todd J.|last5=Clayton|first5=Murray K.|last6=Stewart|first6=Susan I.|last7=Hammer|first7=Roger B.|date=2007-07-01|title=Human Influence on California Fire Regimes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/06-1128.1/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1388\u20131402|doi=10.1890/06-1128.1|issn=1939-5582}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=R.

Developed from a type of [[schooner]] known as [[Baltimore clipper]]s, clipper ships had three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and a [[square rig]]. They were generally narrow for their length, small by later 19th century standards, could carry limited bulk freight, and had a large total [[sail]] area. Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American [[shipyard]]s, though France, Brazil, the [[Netherlands]] and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade, and on the New York-to-San Francisco route around [[Cape Horn]] during the [[California Gold Rush]]. [[Dutch clipper]]s were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to [[Java]].\n\nThe boom years of the clipper ship era began in 1843 as a result of a growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China. It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\n==Origin and usage of \"clipper\"==\n{{Wiktionary|clip}}\nThe term \"clipper\" most likely derives from the verb \"clip\", which in former times meant, among other things, to run or fly swiftly. [[John Dryden|Dryden]], the English poet, used the word \"clip\" to describe the swift flight of a falcon in the 17th century when he said \"And, with her eagerness the quarry missed, Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind.\" The ships appeared to clip along the ocean water. The term \"clip\" became synonymous with \"speed\" and was also applied to fast horses and sailing ships. \"To clip it,\" and \"going at a good clip,\" remained familiar expressions in the early 20th century.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\n[[File:\"Sea Witch\" opium clipper 1831.jpg|thumb|left|\"Opium clipper\" ''Water Witch'', a British ship built in 1831]]\nWhile the first application of the term \"clipper\" in a nautical sense is by no means certain, it seems to have had an American origin when applied to the [[Baltimore clipper]]s of the late 18th century. When these vessels of a new model were built, which were intended to \"clip\" over the waves rather than plough through them, the improved type of craft became known as \"clippers\" because of their speed.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\nIn England the nautical term \"clipper\" appeared a little later. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says its earliest quotation for \"clipper\" is from 1830. This does not mean, however, that little British opium clippers from prior to 1830 were not called \"opium clippers\" just as they are today. Carl C. Cutler reports the first newspaper appearance was in 1835, and by then the term was apparently familiar. An undated painting of the British ''Water Witch'' built in 1831 is labeled ''OPIUM CLIPPER \"WATER WITCH\"'' so the term had at least passed into common usage during the time that this ship sailed.\n\nThere is no single definition of the characteristics of a clipper ship, but mariner and author [[Alan Villiers]] describes them as follows:<blockquote>To sailors, three things made a ship a clipper.  She must be sharp-lined, built for speed.  She must be tall-sparred and carry the utmost spread of canvas.  And she must ''use'' that sail, day and night, fair weather and foul.<ref name=\"Villiers 1962, p. 216\">Villiers (1962), p. 216</ref></blockquote>  Optimized for speed, they were too fine-lined to carry much cargo.<ref name=\"Villiers 1962, p. 216\"/>  Clippers typically carried extra sails such as skysails and moonrakers on the masts, and studdingsails on booms extending out from the hull or yards,<ref>Villiers (1962), frontispiece and p.220</ref> which required extra sailors to handle them.<ref>Villiers (1962), p. 216, 220</ref>  In conditions where other ships would shorten sail, clippers drove on, heeling so much that their lee [[gunwale|rails]] were in the water.<ref>Villiers (1962), pp. 217, 218</ref>\n\nA clipper is often confused with a [[windjammer]], but they are two completely different types of ship. Clippers were optimized for speed only and carrying highly priced cargo in small quantities, such as tea, spices or opium; a windjammer is a large sailing ship which, although it carries a large sail area, is optimized, by contrast, for cargo capacity, ease of handling and carrying low priced bulk cargo, such as grain, fertilizers or lumber. Whereas clippers had very short lifespans\u2014most were scrapped after only two decades of service\u2014windjammers could have fifty or more years of service life, and several windjammers are still today in use as [[school ship]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sovereignoftheseasdockedphoto.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sovereign of the Seas (clipper)|Sovereign of the Seas]]'' set the record for world's fastest sailing ship in 1854]]\n[[File:Hornetclippership.jpg|thumb|''[[Hornet (clipper)|Hornet]]'' \u2013 an American clipper ship of the 1850s]]\n[[File:Portrait of an American Clipper Ship.jpeg|thumb|American clipper ship, painted in typical style by Chinese artist [[Lai Fong]]]]\n\nThe first ships to which the term \"clipper\" seems to have been applied were the [[Baltimore clipper]]s. Baltimore clippers were [[topsail]] [[schooner]]s developed in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] before the [[American Revolution]], and which reached their zenith between 1795 and 1815.  They were small, rarely exceeding 200 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons OM]], and modelled after French [[lugger]]s.<ref name=\"clark\">''The Clipper Ship Era'', Clarke, Arthur H., 1912</ref> Some were lightly armed in the [[War of 1812]], sailing under [[Letter of Marque|Letters of Marque and Reprisal]], when the type\u2014exemplified by ''Chasseur'', launched at [[Fells Point, Baltimore]] in 1814\u2014became known for her incredible speed; the deep [[draft (hull)|draft]] enabled the Baltimore clipper to sail [[Close hauled|close to the wind]].<ref>Villiers 1973.</ref> Clippers, running the British blockade of Baltimore, came to be recognized for speed rather than cargo space.\n\nSpeed was also required for the Chinese opium trade between England, India and China. Small, sharp-bowed British vessels were the result. An early example, which is today known as an opium clipper, was ''Transit'' of 1819. She was followed by many more.<ref name=\"index\">{{cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/becites/genealogy/immigrant/87062528.idx.html#s |title=Fast Sailing Ships: Their Design and Construction, 1775\u20131875, MacGregor, David R., 1988, Index |publisher=Catdir.loc.gov |date=2001-10-18 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Baltimore Clippers still continued to be built, and were built specifically for the China opium trade running opium between India and China, a trade that only became unprofitable for American shipowners in 1849.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas N.

She did, however, influence the building of ''[[Rainbow (clipper)|Rainbow]]'' in 1845, the first [[Extreme Clipper|extreme clipper]] ship.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\nIn [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, the shipbuilders [[Alexander Hall and Sons]] developed the \"Aberdeen\" clipper bow in the late 1830s: the first was ''Scottish Maid'' launched in 1839.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenships.com/sb_alexander_hall.asp |title=Alexander Hall & Sons Ltd |publisher=Aberdeen Ships |date=2006-11-04 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref> ''Scottish Maid'', 150 tons OM, was the first British clipper ship.<ref name=\"clark\" /> \"''Scottish Maid'' was intended for the Aberdeen-London trade, where speed was crucial to compete with steamships. The Hall brothers tested various hulls in a water tank and found the clipper design most effective. The design was influenced by tonnage regulations. Tonnage measured a ship's cargo capacity and was used to calculate tax and harbour dues. The new 1836 regulations measured depth and breadth with length measured at half midship depth. Extra length above this level was tax-free and became a feature of clippers. ''Scottish Maid'' proved swift and reliable and the design was widely copied.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenships.com/related.asp?index=27234&shipid=100020 |title=Aberdeen Built Ships |publisher=Aberdeenships.com |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref> The earliest British clipper ships were built for trade amongst the British Isles. Then followed the vast clipper trade of tea, opium, spices and other goods from the Far East to Europe, and the ships became known as \"tea clippers\".\n\nFrom 1839, larger American clipper ships started to be built beginning with ''Akbar'', 650 tons OM, in 1839, and including the 1844-built [[Houqua (clipper)|Houqua]], 581 tons OM. These larger vessels were built predominantly for use in the China tea trade and known as \"tea clippers\". Smaller clipper vessels also continued to be built predominantly for the China opium trade and known as \"opium clippers\" such as the 1842-built ''[[Ariel (clipper)|Ariel]]'', 100 tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|OM]].<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\nThen in 1845 ''[[Rainbow (clipper)|Rainbow]]'', 757 tons OM, the first [[Extreme Clipper|extreme clipper]] was launched in New York. These American clippers were larger vessels designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. Extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855. \n\nFrom 1851 or earlier another type of clipper ship was also being built in American shipyards, the [[medium clipper]]. \nIn the mid-1800s, shipbuilders in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] began building the medium clipper ship. They \u201cquietly evolved a new type (of ship) of about 450 tons burden which, handled by eighteen officers and men, would carry half as much freight as a British-Indianman of 1500 tons with a crew of 125, and sail half again as fast.\u201d Most owners wanted ships that could do all kinds of work and the \u201cfinest type\u201d then being built was the Medford or Merrimac East Indianman. An example would be the Columbiana built in Medford in 1837, or Jotham Stetson\u2019s ship the Rajah, 531 tons, 140 feet long which was constructed in the previous year. As Admiral Morison points out, ships built in Medford by the firms of J.O. Curtis, Hayden & Cudworth, S. Lapham \u201chave more fast California passages to their credit, considering the number they built, than those of any other place.\u201d That is quite a record.<ref name=MedfordMus>[http://www.medfordhistorical.org/medford-history/about-medford/medford-built-sailing-ships/ Medford Historical Society & Museum:Medford-Built Sailing Ships, at medfordhistorical.org] Accessed 19 October 2017</ref>\n\nIn 1851, shipbuilders in Medford, Massachusetts built the ''Antelope''.  Often called the ''[[Antelope of Boston]]'' to distinguish it from other ships of the same name, this vessel is sometimes called one of the first medium clipper ships.  A ship-design journalist noted that \"the design of her model was to combine large stowage capacity with good sailing qualities.\"<ref>''Boston Daily Atlas'', November 29, 1851</ref>  The ''Antelope'' was relatively flat-floored and had only an 8-inch dead rise at half floor.\n\nThe medium clipper, though still very fast, had comparatively more allowance for cargo. After 1854 extreme clippers were replaced in American shipbuilding yards by medium clippers.<ref name=\"clark\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Flying Cloud (clipper)|Flying Cloud]]'' was a clipper ship that set the world's sailing record for the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours. She held this record for over 100 years, from 1854 to 1989.[1]  ''Flying Cloud'' was the most famous of the clippers built by [[Donald McKay]]. She was known for her extremely close race with the ''Hornet'' in 1853; for having a woman navigator, Eleanor Creesy, wife of Josiah Perkins Creesy, who skippered the ''Flying Cloud'' on two record-setting voyages from New York to San Francisco; and for sailing in the Australia and timber trades.\n\nClipper ships largely ceased being built in American shipyards in 1859 when, unlike the earlier boom years, only 4 clipper ships were built. That is except for a small number built in the 1860s.  The last American clipper ship was \"the Pilgrim\" launched in 1873 from the shipyards of Medford, Massachusetts, built by Joshua T. Foster.  Among ship owners of the day, \u201cMedford-built\u201d came to mean the best.<ref name=MedfordMus/>\n\nDuring the time from 1859 British clipper ships continued to be built. Earlier British clipper ships had become known as extreme clippers, and were considered to be \"as sharp as the American\"<ref name=\"index\" /> built ships. From 1859 a new design was developed for British clipper ships that was nothing like the American clippers. These ships built from 1859 continued to be called extreme clippers. The new design had a sleek graceful appearance, less sheer, less freeboard, lower bulwarks, and smaller breadth. They were built for the China tea trade and began with ''Falcon'' in 1859,  and finished with the last ships built in 1870. It is estimated that 25 to 30 of these ships were built, and no more than 4\u20135 per year. The earlier ships were made from wood, though some were made from iron, just as some British clippers had been made from iron prior to 1859. In 1863 the first tea clippers of composite construction were brought out, combining the best of both worlds. Composite clippers had the strength of iron spars with wooden hulls, and [[copper sheathing]] could be added to prevent the fouling that occurred on iron hulls.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\nAfter 1869 with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] that greatly advantaged steam vessels (see below, \"Decline\"), the tea trade then collapsed for clippers. From the late 1860s-early 1870s the clipper trade increasingly focused on trade and the carrying of immigrants between England and Australia and New Zealand, a trade that had begun earlier with the Australian Gold Rush in the 1850s. British-built clipper ships were used for this trade, as were many American-built ships which were sold to British owners. Even in the 1880s, sailing ships were still the main carriers of cargoes to and from Australia and New Zealand. Eventually, however, even this trade became unprofitable, and the aging clipper fleet became unseaworthy.<ref name=\"clark\" />\n\n== China clippers and the apogee of sail{{anchor|Opium_clipper|Tea_clipper|China clipper}} ==\n[[File:Buttersworth - flying cloud.jpg|thumb|''The Clipper Ship \"Flying Cloud\" off the Needles, Isle of Wight'', by [[James E. Buttersworth]], 1859\u201360.]]\n[[File:Clipper Ship Southern Cross Leaving Boston Harbor 1851.jpeg|thumb|Clipper ship ''Southern Cross'' leaving Boston Harbor, 1851, by [[Fitz Hugh Lane]]]]\n[[File:Tea Clipper Foochow - sand painting by Brian Pike.jpg|thumb|Tea Clipper Foochow - sand painting by Environmental Sand-painter Brian Pike]]\nAmong the most notable clippers were the China clippers, also called '''tea clippers''' or '''opium clippers''', designed to ply the trade routes between Europe and the [[East Indies]]. The last example of these still in reasonable condition was ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', preserved in [[dry dock]] at [[Greenwich]], United Kingdom. [[Cutty Sark#Conservation and fire|Damaged by fire]] on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation, the ship was permanently elevated three meters above the dry dock floor in 2010 as part of a plan for long-term preservation.\n\nBefore the early 18th century, the East India Company paid for its tea mainly in silver. However, when the Chinese Emperor chose to embargo European manufactured commodities and demand payment for all Chinese goods in silver, the price rose, restricting free trade. The [[East India Company]] began to manufacture a product that was desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British: opium. This had a significant influence on both India and China. Opium was also imported into Britain and was not prohibited because it was thought to be medically beneficial. [[Laudanum]], which was made from opium was also used as a pain killer, to induce sleep and to suppress anxiety. The famous literary opium addicts [[Thomas De Quincey]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Wilkie Collins]] also took it for its pleasurable effects. The [[Limehouse]] area in London was notorious for its opium dens, many of which catered for Chinese sailors as well as English addicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/conMediaFile.3989/The-opium-clipper-Water-Witch-%281831%29.html |title=The Opium Clippers |publisher=Portcities.org.uk |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref>\n\nClippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. One passenger ship survives, the [[City of Adelaide (1864)|City of Adelaide]] designed by [[William Pile (shipbuilder)|William Pile]] of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as tea, [[opium]], spices, people, and mail. The return could be spectacular. The ''[[Challenger (clipper)|Challenger]]'' returned from Shanghai with ''\"the most valuable cargo of tea and silk ever to be laden in one bottom\"''.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = State Street Trust Co.  | last = Forbes | first = Allan |author2=Ralph Mason Eastman | title = Yankee ship sailing cards...  | year = 1952 }}</ref> Competition among the clippers was public and fierce, with their times recorded in the newspapers. The ships had short expected lifetimes and rarely outlasted two decades of use before they were broken up for salvage. Given their speed and maneuverability, clippers frequently mounted [[cannon]] or [[carronade]]s and were used for [[pirate|piracy]], [[privateer]]ing, [[smuggling]], or interdiction service.\n[[File:Clipper barque Spirit of the Age, PY0633.jpg|thumb|Clipper barque ''Spirit of the Age'' 1854 by [[Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton|T. G. Dutton]]]]\nThe last China clippers were acknowledged as the fastest sail vessels. When fully rigged and riding a tradewind, they had peak average speeds over {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}. [[The Great Tea Race of 1866]] showcased their speed.  China clippers are also the fastest commercial sailing vessels ever made. Their speeds have been exceeded many times by modern [[yacht]]s, but never by a commercial sail vessel. Only the fastest [[windjammer]]s could attain similar speeds.\n{{quotation|\nThere are many ways of judging the speed of a ship: by knots, by day's runs, by port-to-port records.  Judged by any test, the American clippers were supreme.\n\nDonald McKay's ''[[Sovereign of the Seas (clipper)|Sovereign of the Seas]]''  reported the highest speed ever achieved by a sailing ship \u2013 {{convert|22|kn|km/h}}, made while running her easting down to Australia in 1854.  (John Griffiths' first clipper, the ''Rainbow'', had a top speed of 14 knots...) There are eleven other instances of a ship's logging {{convert|18|kn|km/h}} or over.  Ten of these were recorded by American clippers...\n Besides the breath-taking {{convert|465|nmi|km|sing=on}} day's run of the ''[[Champion of the Seas]]'', there are thirteen other cases of a ship's sailing over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} in 24 hours...\n\nAnd with few exceptions all the port-to-port sailing records are held by the American clippers.\n| Lyon, Jane D | p. 138 ''Clipper Ships and Captains'' (1962) New York: American Heritage Publishing }}\n\nThe 24h record of the ''Champion of the Seas'' wasn't broken until 1984 (by a multihull), or 2001 (by another monohull).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=81&Itemid=21 |title=24 Hour Distance |publisher=Sailspeedrecords.com |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n\nDecline in the use of clippers started with the economic slump following the [[Panic of 1857]] and continued with the gradual introduction of the [[steamship]]. Although clippers could be much faster than early steamships, they depended on the vagaries of the wind, while steamers could keep to a schedule. The ''steam clipper'' was developed around this time, and had auxiliary steam engines which could be used in the absence of wind. An example was ''[[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]'', built in 1857 and wrecked on the coast of [[Anglesey]] in 1859. The final blow was the [[Suez Canal]], opened in 1869, which provided a great shortcut for steamships between Europe and Asia, but was difficult for sailing ships to use. With the absence of the tea trade, some clippers began operating in the wool trade, between Britain and Australia.\n{{quotation|\n\u201cThey [clipper ships] still hold their own for long sea voyages.\n\nThere is a limit to the use of steam, and it is reached when the distance to be travelled makes the cost of coal and the space it occupies greater than the value of the cargo will warrant.\n\nUntil some new motive power replaces steam, or steam is replaced by the use of petroleum or other concentrated fuel, the clipper still has an occupation, and the hearts of all old-time skippers will be gladdened by the sight of her white wings upon the seas.\u201d\n<ref>\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Rideing\n  | first = William H\n  | title = Ocean steamships; a popular account of their construction, development, management and appliances\n  | publisher = C.

Since the 1920s, there has been speculation that nuclear fusion might be possible at much lower temperatures by catalytically fusing hydrogen absorbed in a metal catalyst. In 1989, a claim by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann (then one of the world's leading electrochemists) that such cold fusion had been observed caused a brief media sensation before the majority of scientists criticized their claim as incorrect after many found they could not replicate the excess heat. Since the initial announcement, cold fusion research has continued by a small community of researchers who believe that such reactions happen and hope to gain wider recognition for their experimental evidence.\n\n===Early research===\nThe ability of [[palladium hydride|palladium to absorb hydrogen]] was recognized as early as the nineteenth century by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]].{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=7}}<ref>{{Cite journal|title = On the Absorption and Dialytic Separation of Gases by Colloid Septa|url = http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/156/399|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|date = 1866-01-01|issn = 0261-0523|pages = 399\u2013439|volume = 156|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1866.0018|first = Thomas|last = Graham|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151231225845/http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/156/399|archivedate = 31 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In the late 1920s, two Austrian born scientists, [[Friedrich Paneth]] and [[Kurt Peters (chemist)|Kurt Peters]], originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature.

After a brief period of interest by the wider scientific community, their reports were called into question by nuclear physicists. Pons and Fleischmann never retracted their claims, but moved their research program to France after the controversy erupted.\n\n====Events preceding announcement====\n[[File:Cold fusion electrolysis.svg|thumb|Electrolysis cell schematic]]\n[[Martin Fleischmann]] of the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Stanley Pons]] of the [[University of Utah]] hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of [[deuterium]] that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the [[heavy water]] being renewed at intervals.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50&nbsp;\u00b0C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}}\n\nIn 1988 Fleischmann and Pons applied to the [[United States Department of Energy]] for funding towards a larger series of experiments.

This creates a high partial pressure, reducing the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough by a factor of ten to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment.<ref name=\"distance\" /> It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower potential barrier could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a simple application of [[Coulomb's law]].

Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there has not yet been a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation that cold fusion researchers have made in calorimetry analyses and energy budgets.\n\n====Reproducibility====\nIn 1989, after Fleischmann and Pons had made their claims, many research groups tried to reproduce the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, without success. A few other research groups, however, reported successful reproductions of cold fusion during this time. In July 1989, an Indian group from the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] ([[P. K. Iyengar]] and M. Srinivasan) and in October 1989, [[John Bockris|John Bockris']] group from [[Texas A&M University]] reported on the creation of tritium. In December 1990, professor [[Richard Oriani]] of the [[University of Minnesota]] reported excess heat.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nGroups that did report successes found that some of their cells were producing the effect, while other cells that were built exactly the same and used the same materials were not producing the effect.{{sfn|ps=|Platt|1998}} Researchers that continued to work on the topic have claimed that over the years many successful replications have been made, but still have problems getting reliable replications.{{sfn|ps=|Simon|2002|pp=145\u2013148}} [[Reproducibility]] is one of the main principles of the scientific method, and its lack led most physicists to believe that the few positive reports could be attributed to experimental error.{{sfn|ps=|Platt|1998}}<ref group=\"text\" name=\"reger\"/> The DOE 2004 report said among its conclusions and recommendations:\n\n{{quote|text=\"Ordinarily, new scientific discoveries are claimed to be consistent and reproducible; as a result, if the experiments are not complicated, the discovery can usually be confirmed or disproved in a few months.

A group at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] found problems with their neutron detector, and Texas A&M discovered bad wiring in their thermometers.{{sfn|ps=|Bird|1998|pp=261\u2013262}} These retractions, combined with negative results from some famous laboratories,{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} led most scientists to conclude, as early as 1989, that no positive result should be attributed to cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Bird|1998|pp=261\u2013262}}{{sfn|ps=|Saeta|1999|loc= (pages 5\u20136; \"Response\"; Heeter, Robert F.)}}\n\n====Calorimetry errors====\nThe calculation of excess heat in electrochemical cells involves certain assumptions.<ref>{{harvnb|Biberian|2007}}&nbsp;\u2013 (Input power is calculated by multiplying current and voltage, and output power is deduced from the measurement of the temperature of the cell and that of the bath\")</ref> Errors in these assumptions have been offered as non-nuclear explanations for excess heat.\n\nOne assumption made by Fleischmann and Pons is that the efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible [[Joule heating|resistive heating]] and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} This assumption gives the amount of energy expended converting liquid D<sub>2</sub>O into gaseous D<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990|loc=Appendix}} The efficiency of electrolysis is less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter.

Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and reduce maintenance cost associated with [[asphalt]] pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.\n\nCoal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot [[sealcoat]] products used to protect the structural integrity of the underlying pavement.<ref name=\"fs20113010\">{{cite web| author1 = Mahler BJ| author2 = Van Metre PC| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| title = Coal-Tar-Based Pavement Sealcoat, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Environmental Health| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet| date = {{date| 2 feb 2011}}| accessdate = {{date| 8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328042236/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| archivedate = 2013-03-28| df = }}</ref> Sealcoat products that are coal-tar based typically contain 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch.<ref name=\"fs20113010\"/> Research<ref name=lakes>{{cite journal| title = Contribution of PAHs from coal-tar pavement sealcoat and other sources to 40 U.S. lakes| author1 = Van Metre PC| author2 = Mahler BJ| journal = U.S. Geological Survey| date = {{date| 15 dec 2010}}| pmid = 21112613| doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.014| volume=409| issue=2| pages=334\u201344| bibcode=2010ScTEn.409..334V}}</ref> shows it is used in [[United States]] states from [[Alaska]] to [[Florida]], but several areas have banned its use in sealcoat products,\n<ref name=austin>{{cite web| url = http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Watershed/coaltar_ordinance.pdf| title = City of Austin Ordinance 20051117-070| date = {{date|17 nov 2005}}| accessdate = {{date|8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130531014726/http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Watershed/coaltar_ordinance.pdf| archivedate = 2013-05-31| df = }}</ref><ref name=dc>{{cite web| title = District Bans Coal-Tar Pavement Products| url = http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/ddoe/section/2/release/17479| date = {{date|26 jun 2009}}| accessdate = {{date|8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121226213006/http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/ddoe/section/2/release/17479| archivedate = 2012-12-26| df = }}</ref><ref name=dane>{{cite web| publisher = Dane County Office of Lakes and Watersheds| url = http://pdf.countyofdane.com/ordinances/ORD080.pdf| title = Ordinance 80 : Establishing Regulations on Coal Tar Sealcoat Products Application and Sale| date = {{date| 1 jul 2007}}| accessdate = {{date| 8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110824044232/http://pdf.countyofdane.com/ordinances/ORD080.pdf| archivedate = 2011-08-24| df = }}</ref> including the District of Columbia; the City of Austin, Texas; Dane County, Wisconsin; Washington State; and several municipalities in Minnesota and others.<ref>{{cite web| title = Coal Tar Free America&nbsp;\u2013 Bans| url = http://coaltarfreeamerica.blogspot.com/p/bans.html| date = | accessdate = {{date|8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095421/http://coaltarfreeamerica.blogspot.com/p/bans.html| archivedate = 2014-10-06| df = }}</ref><ref name=\"EESI\">{{cite conference| conferenceurl = http://www.eesi.org/pahs-increasing-urban-us-lakes-14-apr-2011| conference = PAHs Increasing in Urban U.S. Lakes| url = http://files.eesi.org/mahler_041411.pdf| title = Causes of Increasing Concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in U.S. Lakes| author = Barbara J Mahler| publisher = Environmental and Energy Study Institute| date = {{date|14 apr 2011}}| accessdate = {{date| 8 mar 2013}}| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005105420/http://files.eesi.org/mahler_041411.pdf| archivedate = 2011-10-05| df = }}</ref>\n\n=== Industry ===\nBeing flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire [[boilers]]. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.\n\nA large part of the binder used in the [[graphite]] industry for making \"green blocks\" is coke oven volatiles (COV), a considerable portion of which is coal tar. During the baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial graphite production, most of the coal tar binders are vaporised and are generally burned in an incinerator to prevent release into the atmosphere, as COV and coal tar can be injurious to health.\n\nCoal tar is also used to manufacture paints, synthetic dyes (notably [[tartrazine]]/Yellow #5), and photographic materials.\n\nIn the [[coal gas]] era, there were many companies in Britain whose business was to [[distill]] coal tar to separate the higher-value fractions, such as [[naphtha]], [[creosote]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]].

Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, women and men, who gathered around her.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nAs social and political tensions mounted in Siena, Catherine found herself drawn to intervene in wider politics. She made her first journey to [[Florence]] in 1374, probably to be interviewed by the Dominican authorities at the General Chapter held in Florence in May 1374, though this is controverted (if she was interviewed, then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox).<ref name=foley/> It seems that at this time she acquired Raymond of Capua as her confessor and spiritual director.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n\nAfter this visit, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through \"the total love for God.\"{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=342}} In Pisa, in 1375, she used what influence she had to sway that city and [[Lucca]] away from alliance with the anti-papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength. She also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade. It was in Pisa in 1375 that, according to Raymond of Capua's biography, she received the [[stigmata]] (visible, at Catherine's request, only to herself).{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n{{Christian mysticism}}\nPhysical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. From 1375{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} onwards, she began dictating letters to scribes.<ref name=\"Siena. Available Means 2001\"/> These letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle, increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the [[Papacy]] from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] to [[Rome]]. She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].\n\nTowards the end of 1375, she returned to Siena, to assist a young political prisoner, Niccol\u00f2 di Tuldo, at his execution.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}<ref>Letter T273, written by Catherine to Raymond, probably in June 1375, describes the event.</ref> In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] as ambassador of the [[Republic of Florence]] to make peace with the Papal States (on 31 March 1376 Gregory XI had placed Florence under interdict).

During this period, in autumn 1377, she had the experience which led to the writing of her ''Dialogue'' and learned to write, although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence.<ref name=\"Gardner\" /><ref>This experience is recorded in Letter 272, written to Raymond in October 1377.</ref>\n\nLate in 1377 or early in 1378 Catherine again travelled to Florence, at the order of Gregory XI, to seek peace between Florence and Rome. Following Gregory's death in [[Western Schism|March 1378 riots]], the revolts of the [[Ciompi]], broke out in Florence on 18 June, and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated. Eventually, in July 1378, peace was agreed between Florence and Rome; Catherine returned quietly to Florence.\n\nIn late November 1378, with the outbreak of the [[Western Schism]], the new Pope, [[Urban VI]], summoned her to Rome. She stayed at Pope Urban VI's court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}\n\nFor many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CSIENA.HTM Butler, Alban.

This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood. Her confessor, Blessed Raymond, ordered her to eat properly.

Though much of this material is heavily [[Hagiography|hagiographic]], it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct Catherine's life. Various sources are particularly important, especially the works of Raymond of Capua, who was Catherine's spiritual director and close friend from 1374 until her death, and himself became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Order in 1380. Raymond began writing what is known as the ''Legenda Major'', his ''Life'' of Catherine, in 1384, and completed it in 1395.\n\nAnother important work written after Catherine's death was ''Libellus de Supplemento'' (''Little Supplement Book''), written between 1412 and 1418 by Tommaso d'Antonio Nacci da Siena (commonly called Thomas of Siena, or Tommaso Caffarini): the work is an expansion of Raymond's ''Legenda Major'' making heavy use of the notes of Catherine's first confessor, Tommaso della Fonte (notes that do not survive anywhere else). Caffarini later published a more compact account of Catherine's life, entitled the ''Legenda Minor''.\n\nFrom 1411 onwards, Caffarini also co-ordinated the compiling of the ''Processus'' of Venice, the set of documents submitted as part of the process of [[canonisation]] of Catherine, which provides [[Christian testimony|testimony]] from nearly all of Catherine's disciples. There is also an anonymous piece entitled \"Miracoli della Beata Caterina\" (''Miracle of Blessed Catherine''), written by an anonymous Florentine. A few other relevant pieces survive.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 2}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Caterina - Libro della divina dottrina, circa 1475 - 2367969.jpg|thumb|'' Libro della divina dottrina'' (commonly known as ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''), c.1475]]\n[[File:L'epistole della serafica vergine s. Caterina da Siena.tif|thumb|''L'epistole della serafica vergine s. Caterina da Siena'' (1721)]]\n\nThree genres of work by Catherine survive:\n* Her major treatise is ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''. This was probably begun in October 1377, and was certainly finished by November 1378. Contemporaries of Catherine are united in asserting that much of the book was dictated while Catherine was in ecstasy, though it also seems possible that Catherine herself may then have re-edited many passages in the book.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 13}} It is a dialogue between a soul who \"rises up\" to God and God himself.\n* Catherine's letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. Many of these were dictated, although she herself learned to write in 1377; more than 300 have survived. In her letters to the Pope, she often addressed him affectionately simply as ''Babbo'' (\"Daddy\"), instead of the formal form of address  \"Your Holiness\". Other correspondents include her various confessors, among them [[Raymond of Capua]], the kings of France and Hungary, the infamous mercenary [[John Hawkwood]], the Queen of Naples, members of the [[Visconti family]] of Milan, and numerous religious figures. Approximately one third of her letters are to women.\n* 26 prayers of Catherine of Siena also survive, mostly composed in the last eighteen months of her life.\n\n==Theology==\nCatherine's theology can be described as [[Christian mysticism|mystical]], and was employed towards practical ends for her own spiritual life or those of others.<ref>Noffke, Suzanne. \"Catherine of Siena.\" In Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition c. 1100-c. 1500.

When they opened the bag to show the guards, it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals. Once back at Siena, as they reopened the bag her head was visible once more.

He is best known as the author of ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', which presented [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]\u2013the idea that the Earth was shaped by the same scientific processes still in operation today\u2013to the broad general public. ''Principles of Geology'' also challenged theories popularised by [[Georges Cuvier]], which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in Europe at the time.{{sfnp|Cannon|1961|pp=301-314}}\n\nHis scientific contributions included an explanation of [[earthquake]]s, the theory of gradual \"backed up-building\" of [[volcano]]es, and in [[stratigraphy]] the division of the [[Tertiary]] period into the [[Pliocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Eocene]]. He also coined the currently-used names for geological [[Era (geology)|eras]], [[Palaeozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]]. He incorrectly conjectured that icebergs may be the emphasis behind the transport of [[glacial erratic]]s, and that silty [[loess]] deposits might have settled out of flood waters.\n\nLyell, following [[Deism|deistic]] traditions, favoured an indefinitely long age for the earth, despite geological evidence suggesting an old but finite age.{{sfnp|Rudwick|2014|p=}}  He was a close friend of [[Charles Darwin]], and contributed significantly to Darwin's thinking on the processes involved in evolution. He helped to arrange the simultaneous publication in 1858 of papers by Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] on [[natural selection]], despite his personal religious qualms about the theory. He later published evidence from geology of the time man had existed on Earth.\n\n==Biography==\nLyell was born into a wealthy family, on 14 November 1797, at the family's [[estate house]], [[Kinnordy House]], near [[Kirriemuir]] in [[Forfarshire]]. He was the eldest of ten children. Lyell's father, also named [[Charles Lyell (botanist)|Charles Lyell]], was noted as a translator and scholar of [[Dante]]. Also an accomplished botanist, it was he who first exposed his son to the study of nature. Lyell's grandfather, also Charles Lyell, had made the family fortune supplying the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], enabling him to buy Kinnordy House.\n[[File:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|thumb|The main geographical <br />divisions of Scotland]]\n\nThe [[family seat]] is located in [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]], near the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. Round the house, in the [[strath]], is good farmland, but within a short distance to the north-west, on the other side of the fault, are the [[Grampian Mountains]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. His family's second country home was in a completely different geological and ecological area: he spent much of his childhood at [[Bartley Lodge]] in the [[New Forest]], in Hampshire in southern England.\n\nLyell entered [[Exeter College, Oxford]], in 1816, and attended [[William Buckland]]'s lectures. He graduated with a BA Hons. second class degree in classics, in December 1819, and gained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] 1821.{{sfnp|Bailey|1962|p=}}{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}\nAfter graduation he took up law as a profession, entering [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1820. He completed a circuit through rural England, where he could observe geological phenomena. In 1821 he attended [[Robert Jameson]]'s lectures in Edinburgh, and visited [[Gideon Mantell]] at [[Lewes]], in [[Sussex]]. In 1823 he was elected joint secretary of the [[Geological Society]]. As his eyesight began to deteriorate, he turned to geology as a full-time profession.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} His first paper, \"On a recent formation of freshwater limestone in Forfarshire\", was presented in 1822.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} By 1827, he had abandoned law and embarked on a geological career that would result in fame and the general acceptance of uniformitarianism, a working out of the ideas proposed by [[James Hutton]] a few decades earlier.\n\n[[File:Lyell 1840.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Lyell at the [[British Association]] meeting in Glasgow 1840. Painting by Alexander Craig.]]\nIn 1832, Lyell married [[Mary Horner]] in Bonn, daughter of [[Leonard Horner]] (1785\u20131864), also associated with the [[Geological Society of London]]. The new couple spent their honeymoon in Switzerland and Italy on a geological tour of the area.{{sfn|MaComber|1997}}\n[[File:Lyell Family Grave Brookwood Cemetery.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lyell Family Grave in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] with a memorial to Lyell]]\nDuring the 1840s, Lyell travelled to the United States and Canada, and wrote two popular travel-and-geology books: ''Travels in North America'' (1845) and ''A Second Visit to the United States'' (1849). After the [[Great Chicago Fire]], Lyell was one of the first to donate books to help found the [[Chicago Public Library]]. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nLyell's wife died in 1873, and two years later (in 1875) Lyell himself died as he was revising the twelfth edition of ''Principles''.

He came from a prosperous family, worked briefly as a lawyer in the 1820s, and held the post of Professor of Geology at [[King's College London]] in the 1830s. From 1830 onward his books provided both income and fame. Each of his three major books was a work continually in progress. All three went through multiple editions during his lifetime, although many of his friends (such as Darwin) thought the first edition of the ''Principles'' was the best written.<ref>{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=F. |year=1887 |title=Life and letters of Charles Darwin |volume=II |page=90 |location=London |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=F |last2=Seward |first2=A.C. |year=1903 |title=More letters of Charles Darwin |volume=II |page=232 |location=London. |ref=harv}}</ref> Lyell used each edition to incorporate additional material, rearrange existing material, and revisit old conclusions in light of new evidence.\n\n[[File:Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|Lyell between 1865 and 1870]]\n\n''[[Principles of Geology]]'', Lyell's first book, was also his most famous, most influential, and most important. First published in three volumes in 1830\u201333, it established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist and propounded the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].{{sfn|Thanukos|2012}} It was a work of synthesis, backed by his own personal observations on his travels.\n\nThe central argument in ''Principles'' was that ''the present is the key to the past''&nbsp;\u2013 a concept of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which [[David Hume]] had stated as \"all inferences from experience suppose&nbsp;... that the future will resemble the past\", and [[James Hutton]] had described when he wrote in 1788 that \"from what has actually been, we have data for concluding with regard to that which is to happen thereafter.\"<ref name=\"KEY TO THE PAST\">{{cite web |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34786.htm |title=The Present is the Key to the Past is the Key to the Future |first=Elizabeth Lincoln |last=Mathieson |date=13 May 2002 |publisher=The Geological Society of America |accessdate=28 September 2010 |ref=harv}}</ref> Geological remains from the distant past can, and should, be explained by reference to geological processes now in operation and thus directly observable. Lyell's interpretation of geological change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a powerful influence on the young [[Charles Darwin]]. Lyell asked [[Robert FitzRoy]], captain of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], to search for erratic boulders on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey voyage of the ''Beagle'']], and just before it set out FitzRoy gave Darwin Volume 1 of the first edition of Lyell's ''Principles''. When the ''Beagle'' made its first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in the [[Cape Verde]] islands, Darwin found rock formations which seen \"through Lyell's eyes\" gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels.\n\nWhile in South America Darwin received Volume 2 which considered the ideas of [[Lamarck]] in some detail. Lyell rejected Lamarck's idea of organic [[evolution]], proposing instead \"Centres of Creation\" to explain diversity and territory of species. However, as discussed [[Charles Lyell#Evolution|below]], many of his letters show he was fairly open to the idea of evolution.{{sfnp|Judd|1910|p=}} In geology Darwin was very much Lyell's disciple, and brought back observations and his own original theorising, including ideas about the formation of [[atoll]]s, which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism. On the return of the ''Beagle'' (October 1836) Lyell invited Darwin to dinner and from then on they were close friends. Although Darwin discussed evolutionary ideas with him from 1842, Lyell continued to reject evolution in each of the first nine editions of the ''Principles''. He encouraged Darwin to publish, and following the 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Lyell finally offered a tepid endorsement of evolution in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.\n\n[[File:Lyell Principles frontispiece.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece from ''Elements of Geology'']]\n\n''Elements of Geology'' began as the fourth volume of the third edition of ''[[Principles of Geology|Principles]]'': Lyell intended the book to act as a suitable field guide for students of geology.{{sfnp|Bailey|1962|p=}} The systematic, factual description of geological formations of different ages contained in ''Principles'' grew so unwieldy, however, that Lyell split it off as the ''Elements'' in 1838. The book went through six editions, eventually growing to two volumes and ceasing to be the inexpensive, portable handbook that Lyell had originally envisioned. Late in his career, therefore, Lyell produced a condensed version titled ''Student's Elements of Geology'' that fulfilled the original purpose.\n\n''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' brought together Lyell's views on three key themes from the geology of the [[Quaternary Period]] of Earth history: glaciers, evolution, and the [[age of the human race]]. First published in 1863, it went through three editions that year, with a fourth and final edition appearing in 1873. The book was widely regarded as a disappointment because of Lyell's equivocal treatment of [[evolution]]. Lyell, a devout Christian, had great difficulty reconciling his beliefs with [[natural selection]].{{sfnp|Bynum|1984|pp=153-187}}\n\n==Scientific contributions==\nLyell's geological interests ranged from [[volcano]]es and geological dynamics through [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeontology]], and [[glaciology]] to topics that would now be classified as [[archaeology|prehistoric archaeology]] and [[paleoanthropology]]. He is best known, however, for his role in popularising the doctrine of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. He played a critical role in advancing the study of [[loess]].{{sfnp|Smalley|Gaudenyi|Jovanovic|2015|pp=45-50}}\n\n===Uniformitarianism===\nFrom 1830 to 1833 his multi-volume ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was published. The work's subtitle was \"An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation\", and this explains Lyell's impact on science. He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} He was, along with the earlier [[John Playfair]], the major advocate of [[James Hutton]]'s idea of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. This was in contrast to [[catastrophism]], an idea of abrupt geological changes, which had been adapted in England to support belief in [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]]. Describing the importance of uniformitarianism on contemporary geology, Lyell wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Never was there a doctrine more calculated to foster indolence, and to blunt the keen edge of curiosity, than this assumption of the discordance between the former and the existing causes of change... The student was taught to despond from the first. Geology, it was affirmed, could never arise to the rank of an exact science... [With catastrophism] we see the ancient spirit of speculation revived, and a desire manifestly shown to cut, rather than patiently untie, the Gordian Knot.<small>-Sir Charles Lyell, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', 1854 edition, p.196; quoted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Galilei |first=Galileo |title=Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems |year=2001 |publisher=Modern Science Library |location=New York |pages=ix\u2013x |editor=Stephen Jay Gould}}</ref></small></blockquote>\n\nLyell saw himself as \"the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old dispensation of Moses.\"{{sfn|Porter|1976|p=91}} The two terms, ''uniformitarianism'' and ''catastrophism'', were both coined by [[William Whewell]];<ref>Whewell, William 1837. ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', vol. IV of the Historical and Philosophical Works of William Whewell. Chapter VIII The two antagonistic doctrines of geology. [reprint of 3rd edition of 1857, publ. Cass 1967].</ref> in 1866 R. Grove suggested the simpler term ''continuity'' for Lyell's view, but the old terms persisted. In various revised editions (12 in all, through 1872), ''Principles of Geology'' was the most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing. For his efforts he was knighted in 1848, then made a baronet in 1864.\n\n===Geological Surveys===\nLyell noted the \"economic advantages\" that geological surveys could provide, citing their felicity in mineral-rich countries and provinces. Modern surveys, like the [[British Geological Survey]] (founded in 1835), and the [[US Geological Survey]] (founded in 1879), map and exhibit the natural resources within the country. So, in endorsing surveys, as well as advancing the study of geology, Lyell helped to forward the business of modern extractive industries, such as the coal and oil industry.\n\n===Volcanoes and geological dynamics===\n[[File:Vesuvius from plane.jpg|thumb|Lyell argued that volcanoes like Vesuvius had built up gradually.]]\nBefore the work of Lyell, phenomena such as earthquakes were understood by the destruction that they brought. One of the contributions that Lyell made in ''Principles'' was to explain the cause of earthquakes.{{sfnp|Adams|1938|p=}} Lyell, in contrast focused on recent earthquakes (150 yrs), evidenced by surface irregularities such as faults, fissures, stratigraphic displacements and depressions.{{sfnp|Adams|1938|p=}}\n\nLyell's work on volcanoes focused largely on [[Vesuvius]] and [[Mount Etna|Etna]], both of which he had earlier studied. His conclusions supported gradual building of volcanoes, so-called \"backed up-building\",{{sfnp|Bailey|1962}} as opposed to the upheaval argument supported by other geologists.\n\n===Stratigraphy===\nLyell's most important specific work was in the field of [[stratigraphy]]. From May 1828, until February 1829, he travelled with [[Roderick Impey Murchison]] (1792\u20131871) to the south of France (Auvergne volcanic district) and to Italy.{{sfnp|Bailey|1962}}{{sfn|MaComber|1997}}{{sfnp|Stafford|1989|p=}} In these areas he concluded that the recent strata (rock layers) could be categorised according to the number and proportion of marine shells encased within. Based on this he proposed dividing the [[Tertiary]] period into three parts, which he named the [[Pliocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Eocene]].\n\n===Glaciers===\n[[File:glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Lateral moraine on a glacier joining the Gorner Glacier, Zermatt, Switzerland.]]\nIn ''Principles of Geology'' (first edition, vol. 3, Ch. 2, 1833){{sfn|MaComber|1997}} Lyell proposed that [[iceberg]]s could be the means of transport for [[Glacial erratic|erratics]]. During periods of global warming, ice breaks off the poles and floats across submerged continents, carrying debris with it, he conjectured. When the iceberg melts, it rains down sediments upon the land. Because this theory could account for the presence of diluvium, the word ''drift'' became the preferred term for the loose, unsorted material, today called ''till''. Furthermore, Lyell believed that the accumulation of fine angular particles covering much of the world (today called [[loess]]) was a deposit settled from mountain flood water.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyell|first=Charles|title=Life, Letters and Journals of Sir Charles Lyell|year=1881|page=110|chapter=XXIV|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]| url=https://archive.org/stream/lifelettersandj01lyelgoog#page/n130/mode/2up|quote=<br>You hint at icebergs and northern waves. The former has no doubt had its influence, and when icebergs turn over, or fall to pieces, huge waves are caused not merely ''from'' the north. But it has always seemed to me that much more influence ought to be attributed to simple denudation where beds of loose sand, gravel, or mud were upheaved, and sometimes alternately depressed and upraised in an open sea. The exposure of such destructible materials must have led to the confusion you allude to, but much less so where the beds were protected in fiords, &c. The broken fossils found in these strata would agree with my denudation hypothesis, which I think strengthened by the frequent regular re-stratification of the beds containing the deep and shallow water species.}}</ref> Today some of Lyell's mechanisms for geological processes have been disproven, though many have stood the test of time.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}} His observational methods and general analytical framework remain in use today as foundational principles in geology.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}\n\n===Evolution===\nLyell initially accepted the conventional view of other men of science, that the fossil record indicated a directional geohistory in which species went extinct. Around 1826, when he was on circuit, he read [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s ''Zoological Philosophy'' and on 2 March 1827 wrote to [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell]], expressing admiration, but cautioning that he read it \"rather as I hear an advocate on the wrong side, to know what can be made of the case in good hands\".:{{sfnp|Rudwick|2010|pp=244\u2013250}}\n:\"I devoured Lamark... his theories delighted me... I am glad that he has been courageous enough and logical enough to admit that his argument, if pushed as far as it must go, if worth anything, would prove that men may have come from the [[Orangutan|Ourang-Outang]]. But after all, what changes species may really undergo!... That the Earth is quite as old as he supposes, has long been my creed...\"<ref>Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol. 1 p. 168</ref>\nHe struggled with the implications for human dignity, and later in 1827 wrote private notes on Lamarck's ideas. Lyell reconciled [[transmutation of species]] with [[natural theology]] by suggesting that it would be as much a \"remarkable manifestation of creative Power\" as creating each species separately. He countered Lamarck's views by rejecting continued cooling of the Earth in favour of \"a fluctuating cycle\", a long-term steady-state geohistory as proposed by [[James Hutton]]. The fragmentary fossil record already showed \"a high class of fishes, close to reptiles\" in the [[Carboniferous]] period which he called \"the first Zoological era\", and quadrupeds could also have existed then. In November 1827, after [[William Broderip]] found a [[Middle Jurassic]] fossil of the early mammal ''[[Phascolotherium|Didelphis]]'', Lyell told his father that \"There was everything but man even as far back as the Oolite.\"{{sfnp|Rudwick|2010|pp=244\u2013250}} Lyell inaccurately portrayed Lamarckism as a response to the fossil record, and said it was falsified by a lack of progress. He said in the second volume of ''Principles'' that the occurrence of this one fossil of the higher mammallia \"in these ancient strata, is as fatal to the theory of successive development, as if several hundreds had been discovered.\"{{sfn|Ruse|1999|p=76}}\n\n[[File:Charles Darwin portrait by T. H. Maguire, 1849.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Charles Darwin]]\n\nIn the first edition of ''Principles'', the first volume briefly set out Lyell's concept of a steady state with no real progression of fossils, in which humanity had appeared recently, with unique intellectual and moral qualities but no great physical distinction from animals. The second volume dismissed Lamarck's claims of animal forms arising from habits, continuous [[spontaneous generation]] of new life, and man having evolved from lower forms. Lyell explicitly rejected Lamark's concept of transmutation of species, drawing on Cuvier's arguments, and concluded that species had been created with stable attributes. He discussed the geographical distribution of plants and animals, and proposed that every species of plant or animal was descended from a pair or individual, originated in response to differing external conditions. Species would regularly go extinct, in a \"struggle for existence\" between hybrids, or a \"war one with another\" due to population pressure. He was vague about how replacement species formed, portraying this as an infrequent occurrence which could rarely be observed.{{sfn|Ruse|1999|pp=75\u201377}}\n\nThe leading naturalist Sir [[John Herschel]] wrote from [[Cape Town]] on 20 February 1836, thanking Lyell for sending a copy of ''Principles'' and praising the book as opening a way for bold speculation on \"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others\" \u2013 by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]], \"the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\".{{sfn|Babbage|1838|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A25&pageseq=232 225\u2013227]}} Lyell replied: \"In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad to find that you think it probable that it may be carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this rather to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to offend a certain class of persons by embodying in words what would only be a speculation.\"{{sfn|Ruse|1999|p=84}} \n[[William Whewell|Whewell]] subsequently questioned this topic, and in March 1837 Lyell told him:{{sfnp|Judd|1910|p=}}\n:\"If I had stated... the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects\".<ref>Lyell to [[William Whewell]], 7 March 1837. In Lyell K. 1881. ''The life and letters of Sir Charles Lyell''. 2 vols, London. vol. 2 p. 5</ref>\n\nAs a result of his letters and, no doubt, personal conversations, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] and [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] were convinced that, at the time he wrote ''Principles'', he believed new species had arisen by natural methods. [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] wrote worried letters to him about this.{{sfnp|Judd|1910|pp=83\u201386|loc= Ch. 8}}\n\nBy the time [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] returned from the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] in 1836, he had begun to doubt Lyell's ideas about the permanence of species. He continued to be a close personal friend, and Lyell was one of the first scientists to support ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', though he did not subscribe to all its contents. Lyell was also a friend of Darwin's closest colleagues, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], but unlike them he struggled to square his religious beliefs with evolution. This inner struggle has been much commented on. He had particular difficulty in believing in [[natural selection]] as the main motive force in evolution.{{sfnp|Bowler |2003|pp=129\u2013134, 149\u2013150, 215}}{{sfnp|Mayr |1982|pp=375\u2013381, 404\u2013408}}{{sfnp|Bartholomew |1973|pp=261\u2013303}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1862.]]\n\nLyell and Hooker were instrumental in arranging the peaceful co-publication of the theory of natural selection by Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1858: each had arrived at the theory independently. Lyell's data on [[stratigraphy]] were important because Darwin thought that populations of an organism changed slowly, requiring \"geological time\".\n\nAlthough Lyell did not publicly accept evolution (descent with modification) at the time of writing the ''Principles'',{{sfnp|Lyell|1832|pp= 20\u201321}} after the Darwin\u2013Wallace papers and the ''Origin'' Lyell wrote in his notebook:\n:3 May 1860: \"Mr. Darwin has written a work which will constitute an era in geology & natural history to show that... the descendants of common parents may become in the course of ages so unlike each other as to be entitled to rank as a distinct species, from each other or from some of their progenitors\".{{sfnp|Wilson|1970|p=407}}\n\nLyell's acceptance of natural selection, Darwin's proposed mechanism for evolution, was equivocal, and came in the tenth edition of ''Principles''.{{sfn|Wilson|1973}}{{sfnp|Desmond|1982|p=179|ps=: \"Even Charles Lyell agreed... that 'natural selection was a force quite subordinate to that variety-making or creative power to which all the wonders of the organic world must be referred.' \"}} ''[[The Antiquity of Man]]'' (published in early February 1863, just before Huxley's ''Man's place in nature'') drew these comments from Darwin to Huxley:\n:\"I am fearfully disappointed at Lyell's excessive caution\" and \"The book is a mere 'digest' \".<ref>Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982\u2013present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol. 11, pp. 173, 181.</ref>\nQuite strong remarks: no doubt Darwin resented Lyell's repeated suggestion that he owed a lot to [[Lamarck]], whom he (Darwin) had always specifically rejected. Darwin's daughter Henrietta (Etty) wrote to her father: \"Is it fair that Lyell always calls your theory a modification of Lamarck's?\" <ref>Burkhardt F. and Smith S. 1982\u2013present. ''The correspondence of Charles Darwin.'' Cambridge, vol. 11, p. 223.</ref>{{sfnp|Browne|203|p=219}}\n\nIn other respects ''Antiquity'' was a success. It sold well, and it \"shattered the tacit agreement that mankind should be the sole preserve of theologians and historians\".{{sfnp|Browne|203|p=218}} But when Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged, Darwin wrote \"Oh!\" in the margin of his copy.{{sfnp|Bynum|1984|pp=153-187}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Mount Lyell Group.jpg|right|thumb|California's Mount Lyell group]]\n\nPlaces named after Lyell:\n\n* [[Lyell, New Zealand]]\n* [[Mount Lyell (California)]]\n* [[Mount Lyell (Canada)]]\n* [[Lyell Land]] (Greenland)\n* [[Lyell Glacier]]\n* [[Lyell Canyon]]\n* [[Lyell Glacier, South Georgia]]\n* [[Mount Lyell (Tasmania)]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===''Principles of Geology''===\n\n====Online first edition====\n* {{cite book |last=Lyell |first=Charles |volume=vol. 1 |title=Principles of geology, being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |year=1830 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A505.1&pageseq=1|ref=harv|display-authors=0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyell |first=Charles |volume=vol. 2 |title=Principles of geology, being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |year=1832 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A505.2&pageseq=1|ref=harv|display-authors=0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyell |first=Charles |volume=vol. 3 |title=Principles of geology, being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |year=1833 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A505.3&pageseq=1|ref=harv|display-authors=0}}\n\n====Details of publication====\n{{main|Principles of Geology}}\n* ''Principles of Geology'' 1st edition, 1st vol.

It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the [[London Athletic Club]] as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&nbsp;acre (51,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) site.<ref name=\"stadium\"/> Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had also designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=69\u201371}}</ref> Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.\n\nStarting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.<ref name=\"stadium\"/> The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the \"Shed End\", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.<ref name=\"stadium\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/StadiumHistory/0,,10268,00.html\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512170633/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/StadiumHistory/0%2C%2C10268%2C00.html\n |archivedate=12 May 2012\n |title=Stadium History \u2013 Introduction\n |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC\n |accessdate=20 May 2012\n |deadurl=yes\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.<ref name=\"stadium\"/> Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the [[Fee simple|freehold]] being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.<ref name=\"stadium\"/> The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.\n\nWhen Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the [[Ken Bates|Bates]] era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the \"Chelsea Village\" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of ''\"Chelsea Village\"'' or ''\"The Village\"''.\n[[File:Chelsea-ilkmac.jpg|left|frame|Chelsea ''vs.'' [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at Stamford Bridge on 23 September 1905; Chelsea won 1\u20130.]]\nThe Stamford Bridge [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the [[Association football pitch|pitch]], the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders.

Note that the installation is essentially two separate plants, inherent to the CANDU6 design.]]\n\nThe '''CANDU''', for '''Canada Deuterium Uranium''', is a Canadian [[pressurized heavy-water reactor]] design used to generate electric power. The acronym refers to its [[deuterium]] oxide ([[heavy water]]) [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and its use of (originally, [[natural uranium|natural]]) [[uranium]] fuel. CANDU reactors were first developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership between [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL), the [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], [[Canadian General Electric]], and other companies.\n\nThere have been two major types of CANDU reactors, the original design of around 500&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> that was intended to be used in multi-reactor installations in large plants, and the rationalized '''CANDU 6''' in the 600&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> class that is designed to be used in single stand-alone units or in small multi-unit plants. CANDU 6 units were built in [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]], as well as Pakistan, Argentina, South Korea, Romania, and China. A single example of a non-CANDU 6 design was sold to India. The multi-unit design was used only in [[Ontario]], Canada, and grew in size and power as more units were installed in the province, reaching ~880&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> in the units installed at the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]]. An effort to rationalize the larger units in a fashion similar to CANDU 6 led to the '''CANDU 9'''.\n\nBy the early 2000s, sales prospects for the original CANDU designs were dwindling due to the introduction of newer designs from other companies. AECL responded by cancelling CANDU 9 development and moving to the [[Advanced CANDU reactor]] (ACR) design. ACR failed to find any buyers; its last potential sale was for an expansion at Darlington, but this was cancelled in 2009. In October 2011, the Canadian Federal Government licensed the CANDU design to [[Candu Energy Inc.|Candu Energy]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[SNC-Lavalin]]), which also acquired the former reactor development and marketing division of AECL at that time. Candu Energy offers support services for existing sites and is completing formerly stalled installations in Romania and Argentina through a partnership with [[China National Nuclear Corporation]]. SNC Lavalin, the successor to AECL, is pursuing new Candu 6 reactor sales in Argentina (Atucha 3), as well as China and Britain. Sales effort for the ACR reactor has ended.\n\n== Design and operation==\n[[File:CANDU Reactor Schematic.svg|thumb|400px|Schematic diagram of a CANDU reactor: {{color box|#f2cd44}} Hot and {{color box|#feeda9}} cold sides of the primary heavy-water loop; {{color box|#e12c2c}} hot and {{color box|#3d99fa}} cold sides of secondary light-water loop; and {{color box|#ffccff}} cool heavy water moderator in the '''calandria''', along with partially inserted adjuster rods (as CANDU [[control rod]]s are known).\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n {{ordered list\n | Fuel bundle\n | Calandria (reactor core)\n | Adjuster rods\n | [[Heavy-water]] pressure reservoir\n | [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|Steam generator]]\n | [[Water|Light-water]] [[pump]]\n | Heavy-water pump\n | Fueling machines\n | Heavy-water [[neutron moderator|moderator]]\n | Pressure tube\n | Steam going to [[steam turbine]]\n | Cold water returning from turbine\n | [[Containment building]] made of [[reinforced concrete]]\n }}\n}}\n]]\n\nThe basic operation of the CANDU design is similar to other nuclear reactors. [[nuclear fission|Fission]] reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a ''primary cooling loop''. A [[heat exchanger]], also known as a [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]], transfers the heat to a ''secondary cooling loop'', which powers a steam [[turbine]] with an [[electric generator]] attached to it (for a typical [[Rankine cycle|Rankine thermodynamic cycle]]). The exhaust steam from the turbines is then cooled, condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator. The final cooling often uses cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]] near [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], use a diffuser to spread the warm outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment. {{Citation needed span|text=A [[cooling tower]] can be used, but it reduces efficiency and increases costs considerably.|reason=|date=November 2017}}\n\nWhere the CANDU design differs is in the details of the fissile core and the primary cooling loop. [[Natural uranium]] consists of a mix of mostly [[uranium-238]] with small amounts of [[uranium-235]] and trace amounts of other isotopes. Fission in these elements releases high-energy [[neutron]]s, which can cause other U-235 atoms in the fuel to undergo fission as well. This process is much more effective when the neutron energies are much lower than what the reactions release naturally. Most reactors use some form of [[neutron moderator]] to lower the energy of the neutrons, or \"[[thermal neutron|thermalize]]\" them, which makes the reaction more efficient. The energy lost by the neutrons heats the moderator and is extracted for power.\n\nMost commercial reactor designs use normal water as the moderator. Water absorbs some of the neutrons, enough that it is not possible to keep the reaction going in natural uranium. CANDU replaces this \"light\" water with [[heavy water]].\nHeavy water's extra neutron decreases its ability to absorb excess neutrons, resulting in a better [[neutron economy]]. This allows CANDU to run on unenriched [[natural uranium]], or uranium mixed with a wide variety of other materials such as [[plutonium]] and [[thorium]]. This was a major goal of the CANDU design; by operating on natural uranium the cost of enrichment is removed. This also presents an advantage in [[nuclear proliferation]] terms, as there is no need for enrichment facilities, which might also be used for weapons.\n\n{{anchor|Calandria (nuclear reactor)}}<!--- [[Calandria (nuclear reactor)]] is a redirect to here;  this is where the term is defined in wikipedia. --->\n\n===Calandria and fuel design===\nIn conventional [[light-water reactor]] (LWR) designs, the entire fissile core is placed in a large [[pressure vessel]]. The amount of heat that can be removed by a unit of a coolant is a function of the temperature; by pressurizing the core, the water can be heated to much greater temperatures [[boiling point|before boiling]], thereby removing more heat and allowing the core to be smaller and more efficient. Building a pressure vessel of the required size is a challenge. At the time of CANDU's design, Canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the pressure vessels of this size.<ref name=\"Basic CANDU Design\">B. Rouben, [http://www.unene.ca/un802-2005/ben/BasicCANDUDesign.pdf \"Basic CANDU Design\"], University Network for Excellence in Nuclear Engineering, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn CANDU the fuel bundles are instead contained in much smaller metal tubes about 10&nbsp;cm diameter. The tubes are then contained in a larger vessel containing additional heavy water acting purely as a moderator. This vessel, known as a ''[[Calandria (nuclear reactor)|calandria]]'', is not pressurized and remains at much lower temperatures, making it much easier to fabricate. In order to prevent the heat from the pressure tubes leaking into the surrounding moderator, each fuel tube is enclosed in a second tube. [[Carbon dioxide]] gas in the gap between the two tubes acts as an insulator. The moderator tank also acts as a large [[heat sink]] that provides an additional [[nuclear safety|safety]] feature.\n\nIn a conventional design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core to shut down and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can be removed from the core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.\n\nEach fuel bundle is a cylinder assembled from alloy tubes containing ceramic pellets of fuel. In older designs, the assembly had 28 or 37 half-meter-long fuel tubes with 12 such assemblies lying end-to-end in a pressure tube. The newer [[CANFLEX]] bundle has 43 tubes, with two pellet sizes (so the power rating can be increased without melting the hottest pellets). It is about {{convert|10|cm|in}} in diameter, {{convert|0.5|m|in}} long and weighs about {{convert|20|kg|lbs}} and replaces the 37-tube bundle. To allow the [[neutron]]s to flow freely between the bundles, the tubes and bundles are made of neutron-transparent [[zirconium alloy|zircaloy]] ([[zirconium]] + 2.5% wt [[niobium]]).\n\n=== Purpose of using heavy water ===\n{{further|nuclear reactor physics|nuclear fission|heavy water}}\n[[File:CANDU fuel bundles.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Two CANDU fuel bundles: Each about 50&nbsp;cm in length and 10&nbsp;cm in diameter, and generating about {{convert|1|GWh|lk=in|abbr=on}} of electricity during its time in the reactor]]\n[[File:Bruce-Nuclear-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], operating eight CANDU reactors, is the [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power plant in the world]] by net operating capacity]]\n\nNatural uranium is a mix of [[isotope]]s, mainly [[uranium-238]], with 0.72% fissile [[uranium-235]] by weight. A reactor aims for a steady rate of fission over time, where the neutrons released by fission cause an equal number of fissions in other [[fissile|fissile atoms]]. This balance is referred to as ''[[critical mass|criticality]]''. The neutrons released in these reactions are fairly energetic and don't readily react with (get \"captured\" by) the surrounding fissile material. In order to improve this rate, they must have their energy ''moderated'', ideally to the same energy as the fuel atoms themselves. As these neutrons are in thermal equilibrium with the fuel, they are referred to as ''[[thermal neutron]]s''.\n\nDuring moderation it helps to separate the neutrons and uranium, since <sup>238</sup>U has a large affinity for intermediate-energy neutrons (\"resonance\" absorption), but is only easily fissioned by the few energetic neutrons above \u22481.5\u20132&nbsp;[[MeV]]. Since most of the fuel is usually <sup>238</sup>U, most reactor designs are based on thin fuel rods separated by moderator, allowing the neutrons to travel in the moderator before entering the fuel again. More neutrons are released than are needed to maintain the chain reaction; when uranium-238 absorbs just the excess, plutonium is created, which helps to make up for the depletion of uranium-235. Eventually the build-up of [[fission product]]s that are even more neutron-absorbing than <sup>238</sup>U slows the reaction and calls for refuelling.\n\nLight water makes an excellent moderator, the [[hydrogen|light hydrogen]] atoms are very close in mass to a neutron and can absorb a lot of energy in a single collision (like a collision of two billiard balls). Light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, and there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of <sup>235</sup>U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. In order to allow criticality, the fuel must be ''[[enriched uranium|enriched]]'', increasing the amount of <sup>235</sup>U to a usable level. In [[light-water reactor]]s, the fuel is typically enriched to between 2% and 5% <sup>235</sup>U (the leftover fraction with less <sup>235</sup>U is called [[depleted uranium]]). Enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They are also a [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] concern, as they can be used to enrich the <sup>235</sup>U much further, up to [[weapons-grade]] material (90% or more <sup>235</sup>U). This can be remedied if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an [[International Atomic Energy Agency|internationally approved]] supplier.\n\nThe main advantage of [[heavy-water]] [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] over light water is the reduced absorption of the neutrons that sustain the chain reaction, allowing a lower concentration of active atoms (to the point of using unenriched natural uranium fuel). [[Deuterium]] (\"heavy hydrogen\") already has the extra neutron that light hydrogen would absorb, reducing the tendency to capture neutrons. Deuterium has twice the mass of a single neutron (vs light hydrogen, which has about the same mass); the mismatch means that more collisions are needed to moderate the neutrons, requiring a larger thickness of moderator between the fuel rods. This increases the size of the reactor core and the leakage of neutrons. It is also the practical reason for the calandria design, otherwise, a very large pressure vessel would be needed.<ref name=\"Basic CANDU Design\"/> The low <sup>235</sup>U density in natural uranium also implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality, because the ratio of <sup>235</sup>U to fission products + <sup>238</sup>U is lower. In CANDU most of the moderator is at lower temperatures than in other designs, reducing the spread of speeds and the overall speed of the moderator particles. This means that most of the neutrons will end up at a lower energy and be more likely to cause fission, so CANDU not only \"burns\" natural uranium, but it does so more effectively as well. Overall, CANDU reactors use 30\u201340% less mined uranium than light-water reactors per unit of electricity produced. This is a major advantage of the heavy-water design; it not only requires less fuel, but as the fuel does not have to be enriched, it is much less expensive as well.\n\nA further unique feature of heavy-water moderation is the greater stability of the [[chain reaction]]. This is due to the relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2&nbsp;MeV), leading to some [[n,2n|energetic neutrons]] and especially [[Photodisintegration|gamma rays]] breaking the deuterium nuclei apart to produce extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of [[Nuclear fission products|fission fragments]] have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. The slow response of these gamma-generated neutrons delays the [[Nuclear chain reaction#Timescales of nuclear chain reactions|response of the reactor]] and gives the operators extra time in case of an emergency. Since [[gamma ray]]s travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction in one part of the reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the fission neutrons are thoroughly slowed down before they reach another fuel rod, meaning that it takes neutrons a longer time to get from one part of the reactor to the other. Thus if the chain reaction accelerates in one section of the reactor, the change will propagate itself only slowly to the rest of the core, giving time to respond in an emergency. The independence of the neutrons' energies from the nuclear fuel used is what allows such fuel flexibility in a CANDU reactor, since every fuel bundle will experience the same environment and affect its neighbors in the same way, whether the fissile material is [[uranium-235]], [[uranium-233]] or [[plutonium]].\n\nCanada developed the heavy-water-moderated design in the post\u2013[[World War II]] era to explore nuclear energy while lacking access to enrichment facilities. War-era enrichment systems were extremely expensive to build and operate, whereas the heavy water solution allowed the use of natural uranium in the experimental [[ZEEP]] reactor. A much less expensive enrichment system was developed, but the United States classified work on the [[zippe-type centrifuge#Centrifuge uranium enrichment|cheaper gas centrifuge]] process. The CANDU was therefore designed to use natural uranium.\n\n==Safety features==\nThe CANDU includes a number of active and passive safety features in its design. Some of these are a side effect of the physical layout of the system.\n\nCANDU designs have a positive [[void coefficient]], as well as a small power coefficient, normally considered bad in reactor design. This implies that steam generated in the coolant will ''increase'' the reaction rate, which in turn would generate more steam. This is one of the many reasons for the cooler mass of moderator in the calandria, as even a serious steam incident in the core would not have a major impact on the overall moderation cycle. Only if the moderator itself starts to boil, would there be any significant effect, and the large thermal mass ensures that this will occur slowly. The deliberately \"sluggish\" response of the fission process in CANDU allows controllers more time to diagnose and deal with problems.<ref name=safe>{{cite web|url = http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm | title = Canadian Nuclear FAQ, Section D | work = The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock | accessdate=  2005-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe fuel channels can only maintain criticality if they are mechanically sound. If the temperature of the fuel bundles increases to the point where they are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means that they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimal for a chain reaction, and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own and is normally kept relatively cool.<ref name=safe/>\n\nHeat generated by fission products would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The CANDU designs have several emergency cooling systems, as well as having limited self-pumping capability through thermal means (the steam generator is well above the reactor). Even in the event of a catastrophic accident and core [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]], it is important to remember that the fuel is not critical in light water.<ref name=safe/> This means that cooling the core with water from nearby sources will not add to the reactivity of the fuel mass.\n\nNormally the rate of fission is controlled by light-water compartments called liquid zone controllers, which absorb excess neutrons, and by adjuster rods, which can be raised or lowered in the core to control the neutron flux. These are used for normal operation, allowing the controllers to adjust reactivity across the fuel mass, as different portions would normally burn at different rates depending on their position. The adjuster rods can also be used to slow or stop criticality. Because these rods are inserted into the low-pressure calandria, not the high-pressure fuel tubes, they would not be \"ejected\" by steam, a design issue for many pressurized-water reactors.\n\nThere are two independent, fast-acting safety shutdown systems as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets and drop under gravity into the core to quickly end criticality. This system works even in the event of a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure [[gadolinium nitrate]] neutron absorber solution into the calandria.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#candu_control | title = Canadian Nuclear FAQ, Section A | work = The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock | accessdate=  2005-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Fuel cycle ==\n[[File:CANDU fuel cycles.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Range of possible CANDU fuel cycles: CANDU reactors can accept a variety of fuel types, including the used fuel from light-water reactors]]\n\nA heavy-water design can sustain a chain reaction with a lower concentration of fissile atoms than light-water reactors, allowing it to use some alternative fuels; for example, \"[[reprocessed uranium|recovered uranium]]\" (RU) from used LWR fuel. CANDU was designed for natural uranium with only 0.7%&nbsp;U-235, so RU with 0.9%&nbsp;U-235 is a rich fuel. This extracts a further 30\u201340% energy from the uranium. The DUPIC (''Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU'') process under development can recycle it even without reprocessing. The fuel is sintered in air (oxidized), then in hydrogen (reduced) to break it into a powder, which is then formed into CANDU fuel pellets.\nCANDU can also [[thorium fuel cycle|breed fuel]] from the more abundant [[thorium]]. This is being [[thorium fuel cycle|investigated]] by India to take advantage of its natural thorium reserves.<ref>[http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/08/canada-and-china-work-on-thorium-candu.html \"Canada and China work on Thorium Candu Fuel and India May Start Mining 1 million tons of Thorium\"], [[Next Big Future]], Aug. 2, 2012.</ref>\n\nEven [[MOX fuel#Overview|better than LWRs]], CANDU can utilize a mix of uranium and plutonium oxides ([[MOX fuel]]), the plutonium either from dismantled [[nuclear weapon]]s or reprocessed reactor fuel. The mix of isotopes in reprocessed plutonium is not attractive for weapons, but can be used as fuel (instead of being simply nuclear waste), while burning [[weapons-grade plutonium]] eliminates a proliferation hazard. If the aim is explicitly to burn plutonium or other [[actinide]]s from spent fuel, then special inert-matrix fuels are proposed to do this more efficiently than MOX. Since they contain no uranium, these fuels do not breed any extra plutonium.\n\n==Economics==\nThe neutron economy of heavy-water moderation and precise control of on-line refueling allow CANDU to use a great range of fuels other than enriched uranium, e.g., natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], and used LWR fuel. Given the expense of enrichment, this can make fuel much cheaper. There is an initial investment into the tonnes of 99.75% pure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e |title=Canadian Nuclear FAQ|work=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock |accessdate=5 March 2005}} [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e A. CANDU Nuclear Power Technology A.3 What is \"heavy water\"?] \"'reactor-grade' heavy water, nominally 99.75 wt% deuterium content\".</ref> heavy water to fill the core and heat-transfer system. In the case of the Darlington plant, costs released as part of a [[freedom of information act]] request put the overnight cost of the plant (four reactors totalling 3,512&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> net capacity) at $5.117 billion CAD (about $4.2 billion USD at early-1990s exchange rates). Total capital costs including interest were $14.319 billion CAD (about $11.9 billion USD) with the heavy water accounting for $1.528 billion, or 11%, of this.<ref>[http://www.cleanairalliance.org/files/active/0/DarlingtonFOIresults.pdf \"Final and Total Capital Costs of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station\"], Ontario Power Generation, 27 April 2004.</ref>\n\nSince heavy water is less efficient at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator-to-fuel ratio and a larger core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases the cost for standard features like the [[containment building]]. Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are \u224865% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU, costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only \u224810% of the total, so the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable. The next-generation [[Advanced CANDU Reactor]] (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light-water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator.\n\nWhen first introduced, CANDUs offered much better [[capacity factor]] (ratio of power generated to what would be generated by running at full power, 100% of the time) than LWRs of a similar generation. The light-water designs spent, on average, about half the time being refueled or maintained. Since the 1980s, dramatic improvements in LWR outage management have narrowed the gap, with several units achieving capacity factors ~90% and higher, with an overall fleet performance of 92% in 2010.<ref>[http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/reliableandaffordableenergy/graphicsandcharts/usnuclearindustrycapacityfactors/ \"U.S. Nuclear Industry Capacity Factors (1971\u20132010)\"], Nuclear Energy Institute, 2010.</ref> The latest-generation CANDU 6 reactors have an 88\u201390% CF, but overall performance is dominated by the older Canadian units with CFs on the order of 80%.<ref>[http://media.cns-snc.ca/nuclear_info/candu_performance.html CANDU Lifetime Performance to 30 September 2009], Canadian Nuclear Society.</ref> Refurbished units have demonstrated poor performance to date, on the order of 65%.<ref>Jack Gibbons, \"Darlington Re-Build Consumer Protection Plan\", Ontario Clear Air Alliance, 23 September 2010, p. 3.</ref>\n\nSome CANDU plants suffered from [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station#Cost overruns|cost overruns]] during construction, often from external factors such as government action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/ontariovotes2003/features/power_091703.html |title=Ontario Votes 2003 \u2013 Features \u2013 Who's got the power? |publisher=CBC}}</ref> For instance, a number of imposed construction delays led to roughly a doubling of the cost of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario.

Tritium + deuterium mix undergoes [[nuclear fusion]] more easily than any other substance. Tritium can be used in both the \"fusion boost\" of a [[boosted fission weapon]] and the main fusion process of an [[H-bomb]]. In an H-bomb, it is usually created ''in situ'' by neutron irradiation of [[Isotopes of lithium#Lithium-6|lithium-6]].\n\nTritium is extracted from some CANDU plants in Canada, mainly to improve safety in case of heavy-water leakage. The gas is stockpiled and used in a variety of commercial products, notably [[Tritium illumination|\"powerless\" lighting systems]] and medical devices. In 1985 what was then Ontario Hydro sparked controversy in Ontario due to its plans to sell tritium to the U.S.  The plan, by law, involved sales to non-military applications only, but some speculated that the exports could have freed American tritium for the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Future demands appear to outstrip production, in particular the demands of future generations of experimental [[fusion reactor]]s like [[ITER]]. Currently between 1.5 and 2.1&nbsp;kg of tritium are recovered yearly at the Darlington separation facility, of which a minor fraction is sold.<ref>Scott Willms, [http://fire.pppl.gov/fesac_dp_ts_willms.pdf \"Tritium Supply Considerations\"], Los Alamos National Laboratory, 14 January 2003.</ref>\n\nThe 1998 [[Operation Shakti]] test series in India included one bomb of about 45&nbsp;kt yield that India has publicly claimed was a hydrogen bomb.

WR-1's outlet temperature was about 490&nbsp;\u00b0C compared to the CANDU&nbsp;6's nominal 310&nbsp;\u00b0C, which means that {{clarify span|less cooling fluid is needed to remove the same amount of heat|but oils have at least twice lower heat capacity than water|date=May 2018}}, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.<ref>[http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/wr-1/wr-1_5.html \"Fact Sheet: WR-1 Reactor\"], Canadian Nuclear Society.</ref><ref>[http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/wr-1/wr-1_1.html \"Whiteshell Reactor no. 1\"], Canadian Nuclear Society.</ref>\n\n===600 MW<sub>e</sub> designs===\nThe successes at NPD and Douglas Point led to the decision to construct the first multi-unit station in Pickering, Ontario.  Pickering A, consisting of Units 1 to 4, went into service in 1971.  Pickering B with units 5 to 8 came online in 1983, giving a full-station capacity of 4,120&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub>.  The station is very close to the city of [[Toronto]], in order to reduce [[electric power transmission|transmission]] costs.\n\nA series of improvements to the basic Pickering design led to the CANDU&nbsp;6 design, which first went into operation in the early 1980s. CANDU&nbsp;6 was essentially a version of the Pickering power plant that was redesigned to be able to be built in single-reactor units. CANDU&nbsp;6 was used in several installations outside Ontario, including the [[Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station|Gentilly-2]] in Quebec, and [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]] in New Brunswick. CANDU&nbsp;6 forms the majority of foreign CANDU systems, including the designs exported to Argentina, Romania, China and South Korea. Only India operates a CANDU system that is not based on the CANDU&nbsp;6 design.\n\n===900 MW<sub>e</sub> designs===\nThe [[economics of nuclear power plants]] generally scale well with size. This improvement at larger sizes is offset by the sudden appearance of large quantities of power on the grid, which leads to a lowering of electricity prices through supply and demand effects. Predictions in the late 1960s suggested that growth in electricity demand would overwhelm these downward pricing pressures, leading most designers to introduce plants in the 1000&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> range.\n\nPickering&nbsp;A was quickly followed by such an upscaling effort for the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], constructed in stages between 1970 and 1987. It is the largest nuclear facility in North America and second largest in the world (after [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki-Kariwa]] in Japan), with eight [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] at around 800&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> each, in total 6,232&nbsp;MW (net) and 7,276&nbsp;MW (gross).  Another, smaller, upscaling led to the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]] design, similar to the Bruce plant, but delivering about 880&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> per reactor in a four-reactor station.\n\nAs was the case for the development of the Pickering design into the CANDU&nbsp;6, the Bruce design was also developed into the similar CANDU&nbsp;9.<ref>[http://www.iasmirt.org/SMiRT15/S01-4 \"CANDU 9 Evolution and Future Heavy Water Reactors\"], AECL, 15\u201320 August 1999.</ref> Like the CANDU&nbsp;6, the CANDU&nbsp;9 is essentially a repackaging of the Bruce design, so that it can be built as a single-reactor unit. No CANDU&nbsp;9 reactors have been built.\n\n===Generation III+ designs===\n{{Main|Advanced CANDU Reactor}}\nThrough the 1980s and 90s the nuclear power market suffered a major crash, with few new plants being constructed in North America or Europe. Design work continued throughout, and new design concepts were introduced that dramatically improved safety, capital costs, economics and overall performance. These [[Generation III reactor|generation III+]] and [[Generation IV reactor|generation IV]] machines became a topic of considerable interest in the early 2000s, as it appeared that a [[nuclear renaissance]] was underway and large numbers of new reactors would be built over the next decade.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html \"The Nuclear Renaissance\"], World Nuclear Association.</ref>\n\nAECL had been working on a design known as the ACR-700, using elements of the latest versions of the CANDU&nbsp;6 and CANDU&nbsp;9, with a design power of 700&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub>.<ref name=\"CANDU Evolution\"/> During the nuclear renaissance, the upscaling seen in the earlier years re-expressed itself, and the ACR-700 was developed into the 1200&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> ACR-1000. ACR-1000 is the next-generation (officially, \"generation III+\") CANDU technology, which makes some significant modifications to the existing CANDU design.<ref name=acr1000/>\n\nThe main change, and the most radical among the CANDU generations, is the use of pressurized light water as the coolant. This significantly reduces the cost of implementing the primary cooling loop, which no longer has to be filled with expensive heavy water. The ACR-1000 uses about 1/3rd the heavy water needed in earlier-generation designs. It also eliminates tritium production in the coolant loop, the major source of tritium leaks in operational CANDU designs. The redesign also allows a slightly negative [[void coefficient|void reactivity]], a major design goal of all Gen III+ machines.<ref name=acr1000>[http://www.aecl.ca/Assets/Publications/ACR1000-Tech-Summary.pdf \"ACR-1000 Technical Summary\"], AECL.</ref>\n\nThe design also requires the use of [[enriched uranium#slightly enriched uranium|slightly enriched uranium]], enriched by about 1 or 2%. The main reason for this is to increase the burn-up ratio, allowing bundles to remain in the reactor longer, so that only a third as much spent fuel is produced. This also has effects on operational costs and timetables, as the refuelling frequency is reduced. As is the case with earlier CANDU designs, the ACR-1000 also offers online refuelling.<ref name=acr1000/>\n\nOutside of the reactor, the ACR-1000 has a number of design changes that are expected to dramatically lower capital and operational costs. Primary among these changes is the design lifetime of 60 years, which dramatically lowers the price of the electricity generated over the lifetime of the plant. The design also has an expected capacity factor of 90%. Higher-pressure steam generators and turbines improve efficiency downstream of the reactor.<ref name=acr1000/>\n\nMany of the operational design changes were also applied to the existing CANDU&nbsp;6 to produce the Enhanced CANDU&nbsp;6. Also known as CANDU&nbsp;6e or EC&nbsp;6, this was an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU&nbsp;6 design with a gross output of 740&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over 50 years, with a mid-life program to replace some of the key components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual [[capacity factor]] is more than 90%. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs. The CANDU&nbsp;6e is designed to operate at power settings as low as 50%, allowing them to adjust to load demand much better than the previous designs.<ref>[http://www.aecl.ca/Reactors/EC6.htm \"Enhanced CANDU 6\"], AECL.</ref>\n\n===Sales efforts in Canada===\nBy most measures, the CANDU is \"the Ontario reactor\". The system was developed almost entirely in Ontario, and only two experimental designs were built in other provinces. Of the 29 commercial CANDU reactors built, 22 are in Ontario. Of these 22, a number of reactors have been removed from service. Two new CANDU reactors have been proposed for Darlington with Canadian government help with financing,<ref>{{cite news | first = David | last = Ljunggren | title = Canada nuclear firms seek Ottawa financing | publisher = Reuters | date = 7 August 2008 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0743618220080807?sp=true | accessdate = 2008-08-10}}</ref> but these plans ended in 2009 due to high costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2009/07/14/26b_cost_killed_nuclear_bid.html |title=$26B cost killed nuclear bid |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=14 July 2009 |first=Tyler | last= Hamilton}}</ref>\n\nAECL has heavily marketed CANDU within Canada, but has found a limited reception. To date, only two non-experimental reactors have been built in other provinces, one each in Quebec and New Brunswick, other provinces have concentrated on hydro and coal-fired plants. Several Canadian provinces have developed large amounts of hydro power. Alberta and Saskatchewan do not have extensive hydro resources, and use mainly fossil fuels to generate electric power.\n\nInterest has been expressed in [[Western Canada]], where CANDU reactors are being considered as heat and electricity sources for the energy-intensive [[tar sands|oil sands]] extraction process, which currently uses [[natural gas]]. [[Energy Alberta Corporation]] announced 27 August 2007 that they had applied for a licence to build a new nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30&nbsp;km west of the town of [[Peace River, Alberta]]), with two ACR-1000 reactors going online in 2017 producing 2.2 [[gigawatt]]s (electric).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/08/28/alberta-nuclear.html \"Company begins process to build Alberta's 1st nuclear plant\"], CBC News, 28 August 2007.</ref> A 2007 parliamentary review suggested placing the development efforts on hold.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/03/28/oilsands-nuclear-idUKN2838636320070328 \"Canada wary of nuclear power for oil sands\"], Reuters, 28 May 2007.</ref>\n\nThe company was later purchased by Bruce Power,<ref>[http://www.energyquest4nanticoke.ca/intent.htm \"Bruce Power Signs Letter of Intent With Energy Alberta Corporation\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827032951/http://www.energyquest4nanticoke.ca/intent.htm |date=27 August 2011 }}, Marketwire, 29 November 2007.</ref> who proposed expanding the plant to four units of a total 4.4 gigawatts.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/IT-Bruce_Power_to_make_important_announcement_130308.html \"Bruce Power to prepare Alberta site\"], ''World Nuclear News'', 14 March 2008.</ref> These plans were upset and Bruce later withdrew its application for the Lac Cardinal, proposing instead a new site about 60&nbsp;km away.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=24286 \"Bruce thinks again on Alberta site\"], ''World Nuclear News'', 9 January 2009.</ref> The plans are currently moribund after a wide consultation with the public demonstrated that while about {{frac|5}} of the population were open to reactors, {{frac|4}} were opposed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=275218E7F1F68-B25C-81BE-9AF25F7ADE436D8A |title=Province releases results of nuclear consultation |date=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2016/04/13/though-there-is-potential-for-nuclear-power-in-alberta-theres-more-than-just-public-opinion-holding-it-back |title=Though there is potential for nuclear power in Alberta, there's more than just public opinion holding it back |first=Doug |last=Johnson |date=13 April 2016 |newspaper=Edmonton Examiner}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign sales===\nDuring the 1970s, the international nuclear sales market was extremely competitive, with many national nuclear companies being supported by their governments' foreign embassies. In addition, the pace of construction in the United States had meant that cost overruns and delayed completion was generally over, and subsequent reactors would be cheaper. Canada, a relatively new player on the international market, had numerous disadvantages in these efforts. The CANDU was deliberately designed to reduce the need for very large machined parts, making it suitable for construction by countries without a major industrial base. Sales efforts have had their most success in countries that could not locally build designs from other firms.\n\nIn the late 1970s, AECL noted that each reactor sale would employ 3,600 Canadians and result in $300 million in balance-of-payments income.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/science_technology/energy_production/clips/906/ \"The push to sell Candus abroad\"], CBC, 7 December 1978.</ref> These sales efforts were aimed primarily at countries being run by dictatorships or similar, a fact that led to serious concerns in parliament.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/science_technology/energy_production/clips/900/ \"Selling Candus to 'the wrong people, at the wrong time'\"], CBC, 1976.</ref> These efforts also led to a scandal when it was discovered millions of dollars had been given to foreign sales agents, with little or no record of who they were, or what they did to earn the money.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/science_technology/energy_production/clips/904/ \"Mysterious millions spent on Candu sales commissions\"], CBC, 14 October 1976.</ref> This led to a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] investigation after questions were raised about sales efforts in Argentina, and new regulations on full disclosure of fees for future sales.<ref>\"$4 million bribe given on Candu Argentina says\", ''Toronto Star'', 13 June 1985.</ref>\n\nCANDU's first success was the sale of early CANDU designs to India. In 1963, an agreement was signed for export of a 200 MWe power reactor based  on the Douglas Point reactor. The success of the deal led to the 1966 sale of a second reactor of the same design. The first reactor, then known as [[Rajasthan Atomic Power Station|RAPP-1]] for \"Rajasthan Atomic Power Project\", began operation in 1972. A serious problem with cracking of the reactor's end shield led to the reactor being shut down for long periods, and the reactor was finally downrated to 100&nbsp;MW.<ref>\"Datafile: India\", Nuclear Engineering International, February 1995, p. 22.</ref> Construction of the RAPP-2 reactor was still underway when India detonated its first [[atomic bomb]] in 1974, leading to Canada ending nuclear dealings with the country. Part of the sales agreement was a technology transfer process. When Canada withdrew from development, India continued construction of CANDU-like plants across the country.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.ccnr.org/exports_3.html#3.2 \"Exporting Disaster: CANDUs for India\"], Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, November 1996.</ref>  By 2010, CANDU-based reactors were operational at the following sites: Kaiga (3), Kakrapar (2), Madras (2), Narora (2), Rajasthan (6), and Tarapur (2).\n\nIn Pakistan, the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]] with a gross capacity of 137&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> was built between 1966 and 1971.\n\nIn 1972, AECL submitted a design based on the Pickering plant to Argentina's Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica process, in partnership with the Italian company Italimpianti. High inflation during construction led to massive losses, and efforts to re-negotiate the deal were interrupted by the March 1976 coup led by General Videla. The [[Embalse Nuclear Power Station]] began commercial operation in January 1984.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.ccnr.org/exports_3.html#3.1 \"Exporting Disaster: The Cordoba CANDU\"], Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, November 1996.</ref> There have been ongoing negotiations to open more CANDU&nbsp;6 reactors in the country, including a 2007 deal between Canada, China and Argentina, but to date no firm plans have been announced.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=13990 \"Canada, Argentina and China to cooperate on Candu projects\"], ''World Nuclear News'', 5 September 2007.</ref>\n\nA licensing agreement with Romania was signed in 1977, selling the CANDU&nbsp;6 design for $5 million per reactor for the first four reactors, and then $2 million each for the next twelve. In addition, Canadian companies would supply a varying amount of equipment for the reactors, about $100 million of the first reactor's $800 million price tag, and then falling over time. In 1980, [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] asked for a modification to provide goods instead of cash, in exchange the amount of Canadian content was increased and a second reactor would be built with Canadian help. Economic troubles in the country worsened throughout the construction phase. The first reactor of the [[Cernavod\u0103 Nuclear Power Plant]] only came online in April 1996, a decade after its December 1985 predicted startup.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.ccnr.org/exports_2.html#2.3 \"Exporting Disaster: Romania\"], Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, November 1996.</ref> Further loans were arranged for completion of the second reactor, which went online in November 2007.<ref>[http://www.aecl.ca/Reactors/CANDU6/CANDU6-Units/Cernavoda.htm \"Cernavoda\"], AECL.</ref>\n\nIn January 1975, a deal was announced for a single CANDU&nbsp;6 reactor to be built in South Korea, now known as the [[Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant|Wolsong-1 Power Reactor]].

In December 1990 a further deal was announced for three additional units at the same site, which began operation in the period 1997\u20131999.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.ccnr.org/exports_2.html#2.4 \"Exporting Disaster: South Korea\"], Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, November 1996.</ref> South Korea also negotiated development and technology transfer deals with Westinghouse for their advanced System-80 reactor design, and all future development is based on locally built versions of this reactor.<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C_South_Koreas_nuclear_power_independence_2805082.html \"South Korea's nuclear power independence\"], ''World Nuclear News'', 28 May 2008.</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, construction started on a CANDU&nbsp;6 reactor in Qinshan China [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]], as Phase III (units 4 and 5) of the planned 11 unit facility.

In the case of nuclear power, one normally includes two additional costs, the cost of permanent waste disposal, and the cost of decommissioning the plant when its useful lifetime is over. Generally, the capital costs dominate the price of nuclear power, as the amount of power produced is so large that it overwhelms the cost of fuel and maintenance.<ref>[http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/WebHomeCostOfNuclearPower \"Cost of Nuclear Power\"], nuclearinfo.net.</ref> The [[World Nuclear Association]] calculates that the cost of fuel, including all processing, accounts for less than one cent (0.01&nbsp;USD) per kWh.<ref name=econ>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html|title=The Economics of Nuclear Power|publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]]}}</ref>\n\nInformation on economic performance on CANDU is somewhat lopsided; the majority of reactors are in Ontario, which is also the \"most public\" among the major CANDU operators, so their performance dominates the available information. Based on Ontario's record, the economic performance of the CANDU system is quite poor.{{According to whom|date=December 2015}} Although much attention has been focussed on the problems with the Darlington plant, every CANDU design in Ontario went over budget by at least 25%, and average over 150% higher than estimated.<ref name=apexa>Jack Gibbons, \"Darlington Re-Build Consumer Protection Plan\", Ontario Clear Air Alliance, 23 September 2010, Appendix A, p. 7\u20138.</ref> Darlington was the worst, at 350% over budget, but this project was stopped in-progress thereby incurring additional interest charges during a period of high interest rates, which is a special situation that was not expected to repeat itself.\n\nIn the 1980s, the pressure tubes in the Pickering&nbsp;A reactors were replaced ahead of design life due to unexpected deterioration caused by [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. Extensive inspection and maintenance has avoided this problem in later reactors.\n\nAll the Pickering&nbsp;A and Bruce&nbsp;A reactors were shut down in 1999 in order to focus on restoring operational performance in the later generations at Pickering, Bruce, and Darlington. Before restarting the Pickering&nbsp;A reactors, OPG undertook a limited refurbishment program. The original cost and time estimates based on inadequate project scope development were greatly below the actual time and cost and it was determined that Pickering units 2 and 3 would not be restarted for commercial reasons. Despite this refurbishment, the reactors have not performed well since the restart.{{According to whom|date=December 2015}}\n\nThese overruns were repeated at Bruce, with Units 3 and 4 running 90% over budget.<ref name=apexa/> Similar overruns were experienced at Point Lepreau,<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/10/20/nb-point-lepreau.html \"Point Lepreau overruns to cost $1.6B\"], CBC News, 20 October 2009.</ref> and Gentilly-2 plant was shut down on December 28, 2012.<ref>CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-s-gentilly-2-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-29-years-1.1159855 \"Quebec's Gentilly-2 nuclear plant shuts down after 29 years\"], ''CBC'', December 28, 2012.</ref>\n\nBased on the projected capital costs, and the low cost of fuel and in-service maintenance, in 1994 power from CANDU was predicted to be well under 5&nbsp;cents/kWh.<ref>[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionC.htm#SectionC \"How do the economic benefits of nuclear power compare to other sources in Canada?\"], CANDU FAQ, Section C.1.</ref> In 1998, [[Ontario Hydro]] calculated that the cost of generation from CANDU was 7.7&nbsp;cents/kWh, whereas hydropower was only 1.1&nbsp;cents/kWh, and their coal-fired plants were 4.3&nbsp;cents/kWh. As Ontario Hydro received a regulated price averaging 6.3&nbsp;cents/kWh for power in this period, the revenues from the other forms of generation were being used to fund the operating losses of the nuclear plants. The debt left over from the nuclear construction could not be included in the rate base until the reactors were declared in service, thereby exacerbating the total capital cost of construction with unpaid interest, at that time around $15&nbsp;billion, and another $3.5&nbsp;billion in debts throughout the system<ref name=strand>[http://www.cleanairalliance.org/files/nukedebt.pdf \"Ontario\u2019s Stranded Nuclear Debt: A Cautionary Tale\"], Ontario Clean Air Alliance, 1 March 2011.</ref> was held by a separate entity and repaid through a standing charge on electricity bills.\n\nIn 1999, Ontario Hydro was broken up and its generation facilities re-formed into [[Ontario Power Generation]] (OPG). In order to make the successor companies more attractive for private investors, $19.4&nbsp;billion in \"stranded debt\" was placed in the control of the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation. This debt is slowly paid down through a variety of sources, including a 0.7-cent/kWh tariff on all power, all income taxes paid by all operating companies, and all dividends paid by the OPG and [[Hydro One]]. Even with these sources of income, the amount of debt has grown on several occasions, and in 2010 stood at almost $15&nbsp;billion. This is in spite of total payments on the order of $19&nbsp;billion, ostensibly enough to have paid off the debt entirely if interest repayment requirements are ignored.<ref name=strand/>\n\nDarlington is currently{{When|date=December 2015}} in the process of considering a major re-build of several units, as it too is reaching its design mid-life time. The budget is currently estimated to be between $8.5 and $14 billion, and produce power at 6 to 8 cents/kWh. This prediction is based on three assumptions that appear to have never been met in operation: that the rebuild will be completed on-budget, that the system will operate at an average [[capacity utilization]] of 82%, and that the Ontario taxpayer will pay 100% of any cost overruns.<ref name=g5>Jack Gibbons, \"Darlington Re-Build Consumer Protection Plan\", Ontario Clear Air Alliance, 23 September 2010, p. 5.</ref> Although Darlington Units 1, 3 and 4 have operated with an average lifetime annual capacity factor of 85% and Unit 2 with a capacity factor of 78%,<ref>[http://media.cns-snc.ca/nuclear_info/candu_performance.html  \"CANDU Lifetime Performance\"], Canadian Nuclear Society.</ref> refurbished units at Pickering and Bruce have lifetime capacity factors between 59 and 69%.<ref name=g5/> This includes periods of several years while the units were shut down for the retubing and refurbishing.

According to Cort\u00e9s himself, on 27 February 1525, he learned from a citizen of [[Tenochtitlan]], Mexicalcingo, that Cuauht\u00e9moc, [[Coanacoch]] (the ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]), and [[Tetlepanquetzal]], the ruler of [[Tlacopan]], were plotting his death. Cort\u00e9s interrogated them until each confessed and then had Cuauht\u00e9moc, Tetlepanquetzal, and another lord, Tlacatlec, hanged. Cort\u00e9s wrote that the other lords would be too frightened to plot against him again, as they believed he had uncovered the plan through magic powers. Cort\u00e9s's account is supported by the historian [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]].<ref>Restall (2004, pp.149\u2013150).</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], a [[conquistador]] serving under Cort\u00e9s who recorded his experiences in his book ''[[The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'', the supposed plot was revealed by two men, named Tapia and Juan Vel\u00e1squez. D\u00edaz portrays the executions as unjust and based on no evidence, and he admits to having liked Cuauht\u00e9moc personally. He also records Cuauht\u00e9moc giving the following speech to Cort\u00e9s through his [[interpreting|interpreter]] [[Malinche]]:\n{{quote|Oh Malinzin [i.e., Cort\u00e9s]! Now I understand your false promises and the kind of death you have had in store for me. For you are killing me unjustly.

The spy reported honestly, but Cort\u00e9s invented the plot himself. Cuauht\u00e9moc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cort\u00e9s cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors.

Archeologist [[Eulalia Guzm\u00e1n]], a \"passionate [[Indigenismo in Mexico|indigenista]]\", excavated the bones in 1949, which were discovered shortly after bones of Cort\u00e9s, found in Mexico City, had been authenticated by the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia]] (INAH). Initially, Mexican scholars congratulated Guzm\u00e1n, but after a similar examination by scholars at INAH, their authenticity as Cuauhtemoc's was rejected, as the bones in the ossuary belonged to several different persons, several of them seemingly women. The finding caused a public uproar. A panel assembled by Guzm\u00e1n gave support to the initial contention. The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) had another panel examine the bones, which gave support to INAH's original finding, but did not report on the finding publicly.<ref>Benjamin Keen, ''The Aztec Image in Western Thought'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press 1971, pp 468-69.</ref><ref>Wigberto Jim\u00e9nez Moreno, \"Los hallazgos de Ixcateopan\", ''Historia Mexicana'' XII (1962-63), 161-181</ref> A scholarly study of the controversy was published in 2011 and argued that the available data suggests that the grave is an elaborate hoax prepared by a local of Ichcateopan as a way of generating publicity, and that subsequently supported by Mexican nationalists such as Guzman who wished to use the find for political purposes.<ref>Paul Gillingham, ''Cuauhtemoc's Bones: Forging National Identity in Modern Mexico''.

There is also a [[Cuauht\u00e9moc (Monterrey Metro)|metro station in Monterrey]] named after him.\n\nCuauht\u00e9moc is also one of the few non-Spanish [[given name]]s for Mexican boys that is perennially popular.\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]] Sol\u00f3rzano, a prominent Mexican politician, is named after him. In the Aztec campaign of the [[Personal computer game|PC game]] ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]]'', the player plays as Cuauht\u00e9moc, despite the name ''[[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]]'' for the campaign itself, and Cuauht\u00e9moc narrates the openings and closings to each scenario. In the next installment to the series, ''[[Age of Empires 3: The War Chiefs]]'', Cuauht\u00e9moc was the leader of Aztecs. The [[Mexico|Mexican]] football player [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco]] was also named after him.\n\nIn the 1996 [[Rage Against The Machine]] single ''[[People of the Sun]]'', lyricist [[Zack De La Rocha]] rhymes \"When the fifth sun sets get back reclaimed, The spirit of Cuauht\u00e9moc alive and untamed\".\n\nCuauht\u00e9moc, in the name Guatemoc, is portrayed sympathetically in the adventure novel ''[[Montezuma's Daughter]]'', by [[Henry Rider Haggard|H.

If the particles are hard [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]] [[spheres]] that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross section is related to their geometric size. If the particles interact through some action-at-a-distance force, such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[gravity]], their scattering cross section is generally larger than their geometric size. When a cross section is specified as a function of some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy, it is called a '''differential cross section'''. When a cross section is integrated over all scattering angles (and possibly other variables), it is called a '''total cross section'''. Cross sections are typically denoted {{math|''\u03c3''}} ([[sigma]]) and measured in units of area.\n\nScattering cross sections may be defined in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]] for collisions of accelerated beams of one type of particle with targets (either stationary or moving) of a second type of particle. The probability for any given reaction to occur is in proportion to its cross section. Thus, specifying the cross section for a given reaction is a proxy for stating the probability that a given scattering process will occur.\n\nThe measured [[reaction rate]] of a given process depends strongly on experimental variables such as the density of the target material, the intensity of the beam, the detection efficiency of the apparatus, or the angle setting of the detection apparatus. However, these quantities can be factored away, allowing measurement of the underlying two-particle collisional cross section.\n\nDifferential and total scattering cross sections are among the most important measurable quantities in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]].\n\n== Collision among gas particles ==\n[[File:CrossSectionFig1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Figure 1.''' In a gas of particles of individual diameter {{math|2''r''}}, the cross section {{math|''\u03c3''}}, for collisions is related to the particle number density {{math|''n''}}, and mean free path between collisions {{math|''\u03bb''}}.]]\n\nIn a [[gas]] of finite-sized particles there are collisions among particles that depend on their cross-sectional size. The average distance that a particle travels between collisions depends on the density of gas particles. These quantities are related by\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\frac{1}{n \\lambda},</math>\n\nwhere\n: {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the cross section of a two-particle collision ([[SI]] units: m<sup>2</sup>),\n: {{math|''\u03bb''}} is the [[mean free path]] between collisions (SI units: m),\n: {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m<sup>\u22123</sup>).\n\nIf the particles in the gas can be treated as hard spheres of radius {{math|''r''}} that interact by direct contact, as illustrated in Figure 1, then the effective cross section for the collision of a pair is\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\pi \\left(2r\\right)^2</math>\n\nIf the particles in the gas interact by a force with a larger range than their physical size, then the cross section is a larger effective area that may depend on a variety of variables such as the energy of the particles.\n\nCross sections can be computed for atomic collisions but also are used in the subatomic realm. For example, in [[nuclear physics]] a \"gas\" of low-energy [[neutrons]] collides with nuclei in a reactor or other nuclear device, with a [[Neutron cross section|cross section that is energy-dependent]] and hence also with well-defined [[mean free path]] between collisions.\n\n== Attenuation of a beam of particles ==\n\nIf a beam of particles enters a thin layer of material of thickness {{math|d''z''}}, the flux {{math|''\u03a6''}} of the beam will decrease by {{math|d''\u03a6''}} according to\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm d \\Phi}{\\mathrm d z} = -n \\sigma \\Phi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the total cross section of ''all'' events, including [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or transformation to another species. The number density of scattering centers is designated by {{math|''n''}}. Solving this equation exhibits the exponential attenuation of the beam intensity:\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\Phi_0 e^{-n \\sigma z},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>0</sub>}} is the initial flux, and {{math|''z''}} is the total thickness of the material. For light, this is called the [[Beer\u2013Lambert law]].\n\n== Differential cross section ==\n\nConsider a [[classical mechanics|classical]] measurement where a single particle is scattered off a single stationary target particle. Conventionally, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] is used, with the target placed at the origin and the {{math|''z''}} axis of this coordinate system aligned with the incident beam. The angle {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the '''scattering angle''', measured between the incident beam and the scattered beam, and the {{math|''\u03c6''}} is the [[azimuthal angle]].\n\n:[[Image:Differential cross section.svg|none|600px]]\n\nThe [[impact parameter]] {{math|''b''}} is the perpendicular offset of the trajectory of the incoming particle, and the outgoing particle emerges at an angle {{math|''\u03b8''}}. For a given interaction ([[Coulomb's law|Coulombic]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[gravitation]]al, contact, etc.), the impact parameter and the scattering angle have a definite one-to-one functional dependence on each other. Generally the impact parameter can neither be controlled nor measured from event to event and is assumed to take all possible values when averaging over many scattering events. The differential size of the cross section is the area element in the plane of the impact parameter, i.e. {{math|d''\u03c3'' {{=}} ''b'' d''\u03c6'' d''b''}}. The differential angular range of the scattered particle at angle {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the solid angle element {{math|d''\u03a9'' {{=}} sin ''\u03b8'' d''\u03b8'' d''\u03c6''}}. The differential cross section is the quotient of these quantities, {{math|{{sfrac|d''\u03c3''|d''\u03a9''}}}}.\n\nIt is a function of the scattering angle (and therefore also the impact parameter), plus other observables such as the momentum of the incoming particle. The differential cross section is always taken to be positive, even though larger impact parameters generally produce less deflection. In cylindrically symmetric situations (about the beam axis), the [[azimuthal angle]] {{math|''\u03c6''}} is not changed by the scattering process, and the differential cross section can be written as\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}(\\cos \\theta)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\sigma}{\\mathrm{d} \\Omega} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varphi </math>.\n\nIn situations where the scattering process is not azimuthally symmetric, such as when the beam or target particles possess magnetic moments oriented perpendicular to the beam axis, the differential cross section must also be expressed as a function of the azimuthal angle.\n\nFor scattering of particles of incident flux {{math|''F''<sub>inc</sub>}} off a stationary target consisting of many particles, the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''\u03c3''|d''\u03a9''}}}} at an angle {{math|(''\u03b8'',''\u03c6'')}} is related to the flux of scattered particle detection {{math|''F''<sub>out</sub>(''\u03b8'',''\u03c6'')}} in particles per unit time by\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega}(\\theta,\\varphi) = \\frac{1}{n t \\Delta\\Omega} \\frac{F_\\text{out}(\\theta,\\varphi)}{F_\\text{inc}}.</math>\n\nHere {{math|\u0394''\u03a9''}} is the finite angular size of the detector (SI unit: [[steradian|sr]]), {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m<sup>\u22123</sup>), and {{math|''t''}} is the thickness of the stationary target (SI units: m). This formula assumes that the target is thin enough that each beam particle will interact with at most one target particle.\n\nThe total cross section {{math|''\u03c3''}} may be recovered by integrating the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''\u03c3''|d''\u03a9''}}}} over the full [[solid angle]] ({{math|4\u03c0}} steradians):\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\oint_{4\\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega} \\, \\mathrm d \\Omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega} \\sin \\theta \\, \\mathrm d \\theta \\, \\mathrm d \\varphi.</math>\n\nIt is common to omit the \u201cdifferential\u201d [[qualifier]] when the type of cross section can be inferred from context. In this case, {{math|''\u03c3''}} may be referred to as the ''integral cross section'' or ''total cross section''. The latter term may be confusing in contexts where multiple events are involved, since \u201ctotal\u201d can also refer to the sum of cross sections over all events.\n\nThe differential cross section is extremely useful quantity in many fields of physics, as measuring it can reveal a great amount of information about the internal structure of the target particles. For example, the differential cross section of [[Rutherford scattering]] provided strong evidence for the existence of the atomic nucleus.\n\nInstead of the solid angle, the [[momentum transfer]] may be used as the independent variable of differential cross sections.\n\nDifferential cross sections in inelastic scattering contain [[Resonance (particle physics)|resonance peaks]] that indicate the creation of metastable states and contain information about their energy and lifetime.\n\n== Quantum scattering ==\n\nIn the [[stationary state|time-independent]] formalism of [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] scattering, the initial [[wave function]] (before scattering) is taken to be a plane wave with definite [[momentum]] {{math|''k''}}:\n\n: <math>\\phi_-(\\mathbf r) \\;\\stackrel{r \\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\; e^{i k z},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''r''}} are the ''relative'' coordinates between the projectile and the target. The arrow indicates that this only describes the ''asymptotic behavior'' of the wave function when the projectile and target are too far apart for the interaction to have any effect.\n\nAfter the scattering takes place, it is expected that the wave function takes on the following asymptotic form:\n\n:<math>\\phi_+(\\mathbf r) \\;\\stackrel{r \\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\; f(\\theta,\\phi) \\frac{e^{i k r}}{r},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is some function of the angular coordinates known as the [[scattering amplitude]]. This general form is valid for any short-ranged, energy-conserving interaction. It is not true for long-ranged interactions, so there are additional complications when dealing with electromagnetic interactions.\n\nThe full wave function of the system behaves asymptotically as the sum\n\n:<math>\\phi(\\mathbf r) \\;\\stackrel{r \\to \\infty}{\\longrightarrow}\\; \\phi_-(\\mathbf r) + \\phi_+(\\mathbf r).</math>\n\nThe differential cross section is related to the scattering amplitude:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\bigl|f(\\theta, \\phi)\\bigr|^2.</math>\n\nThis has the simple interpretation as the probability density for finding the scattered projectile at a given angle.\n\nA cross section is therefore a measure of the effective surface area seen by the impinging particles, and as such is expressed in units of area. The cross section of two [[elementary particle|particles]] (i.e. observed when the two particles are [[collision|colliding]] with each other) is a measure of the interaction event between the two particles. The cross section is proportional to the probability that an interaction will occur; for example in a simple scattering experiment the number of particles scattered per unit of time (current of scattered particles {{math|''I''<sub>r</sub>}}) depends only on the number of incident particles per unit of time (current of incident particles {{math|''I''<sub>i</sub>}}), the characteristics of target (for example the number of particles per unit of surface {{math|''N''}}), and the type of interaction. For {{math|''N\u03c3'' \u226a 1}} we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nI_\\text{r} &= I_\\text{i}N\\sigma, \\\\\n\\sigma &= \\frac{I_\\text{r}}{I_\\text{i}} \\frac{1}{N} \\\\\n&= \\text{probability of interaction} \\times \\frac{1}{N}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Relation to the S-matrix ===\n\nIf the [[reduced mass]]es and [[momentum|momenta]] of the colliding system are {{math|''m<sub>i</sub>''}}, {{math|'''p'''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''m<sub>f</sub>''}}, {{math|'''p'''<sub>''f''</sub>}} before and after the collision respectively, the differential cross section is given by{{clarify|reason=This section is an uncontextualized leap. We have jumped, without announcement, from the Schr\u00f6dinger PDE for a wave in a potential to the language of QFT for two particles colliding.|date=September 2016}}\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm d\\sigma}{\\mathrm d\\Omega} = \\left(2\\pi\\right)^4 m_i m_f \\frac{p_f}{p_i} \\bigl|T_{fi}\\bigr|^2,</math>\n\nwhere the on-shell {{math|''T''}} matrix is defined by\n:<math>S_{fi} = \\delta_{fi} - 2\\pi i \\delta\\left(E_f - E_i\\right) \\delta\\left(\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_f\\right) T_{fi}</math>\n\nin terms of the [[S-matrix]]. Here {{math|''\u03b4''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The computation of the S-matrix is the main goal of the [[scattering theory]].\n\n== Units ==\n\nAlthough the [[SI unit]] of total cross sections is [[square meter|m<sup>2</sup>]], smaller units are usually used in practice.\n\nIn nuclear and particle physics, the conventional unit is the barn [[barn (unit)|b]], where 1&nbsp;b = 10<sup>\u221228</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> = 100&nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]]<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|pages=127\u201328}}</ref> Smaller [[metric prefix|prefixed]] units such as [[milli-|mb]] and [[micro-|\u03bcb]] are also widely used. Correspondingly, the differential cross section can be measured in units such as mb/sr.\n\nWhen the scattered radiation is visible light, it is conventional to measure the path length in [[centimetre]]s. To avoid the need for conversion factors, the scattering cross section is expressed in cm<sup>2</sup>, and the number concentration in cm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The measurement of the scattering of visible light is known as [[nephelometry]], and is effective for particles of 2\u201350&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] in diameter: as such, it is widely used in [[meteorology]] and in the measurement of [[atmospheric pollution]].\n\nThe scattering of [[X-ray]]s can also be described in terms of scattering cross sections, in which case the square [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] is a convenient unit: 1&nbsp;\u00c5<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>\u221220</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> = {{val|10000|u=[[picometre|pm]]<sup>2</sup>}} = 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;b.\n\n== Scattering of light ==\n\nFor light, as in other settings, the scattering cross section is generally different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, and it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]], shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is proportional to the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present.\n\nIn terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{mvar|\u03c3}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]{{clarify|reason=Is scattering \"removal of light from a beam\"? Then this characterization should be stated explicitly. Also, it should be explained that luminescence removes light from the direct beam (if this is true), even though one normally associates luminescence with adding light.|date=September 2016}}. The sum of the absorption and scattering cross sections is sometimes referred to as the extinction cross section.\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sigma_\\text{a} + \\sigma_\\text{s} + \\sigma_\\text{l}.</math>\nThe total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer\u2013Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to particle concentration:\n:<math>A_\\lambda = C l \\sigma,</math>\nwhere {{math|''A<sub>\u03bb</sub>''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''\u03bb''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the particle concentration as a number density, and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]].

In general, the scattering cross section is different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, as it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]] in addition to the shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is determined by the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present. In terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{math|''\u03c3''}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]:\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sigma_\\text{a} + \\sigma_\\text{s} + \\sigma_\\text{l}.</math>\n\nThe total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer\u2013Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to concentration: {{math|''A<sub>\u03bb</sub>'' {{=}} ''Cl\u03c3''}}, where {{math|''A<sub>\u03bb</sub>''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''\u03bb''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the concentration as a [[number density]], and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]].

This can be seen when driving in [[fog]]gy weather: the droplets of water (which form the fog) scatter red light less than they scatter the shorter wavelengths present in white light, and the red rear fog light can be distinguished more clearly than the white headlights of an approaching vehicle. That is to say that the scattering cross section of the water droplets is smaller for red light than for light of shorter wavelengths, even though the physical size of the particles is the same.\n\n=== Meteorological range ===\n\nThe scattering cross section is related to the [[visibility|meteorological range]] {{math|''L''<sub>V</sub>}}:\n\n:<math>L_\\text{V} = \\frac{3.9}{C \\sigma_\\text{scat}}.</math>\n\nThe quantity {{math|''C\u03c3''<sub>scat</sub>}} is sometimes denoted {{math|''b''<sub>scat</sub>}}, the scattering coefficient per unit length.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Scattering cross section, {{math|''\u03c3''<sub>scat</sub>}}|file=S05490}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Example 1: elastic collision of two hard spheres ===\n\nThe elastic collision of two hard spheres is an instructive example that demonstrates the sense of calling this quantity a cross section. {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''r''}} are respectively the radii of the scattering center and scattered sphere.\nThe total cross section is\n\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{tot} = \\pi \\left(r + R\\right)^2.</math>\n\nSo in this case the total scattering cross section is equal to the area of the circle (with radius {{math|''r'' + ''R''}}) within which the center of mass of the incoming sphere has to arrive for it to be deflected, and outside which it passes by the stationary scattering center.\n\n=== Example 2: scattering light from a 2D circular mirror ===\n\nAnother example illustrates the details of the calculation of a simple [[light]] scattering model obtained by a reduction of the dimension. For simplicity, we will consider the scattering of a beam of light on a plane treated as a uniform density of parallel rays and within the framework of [[geometrical optics]] from a circle with radius {{math|''r''}} with a perfectly reflecting boundary. Its three-dimensional equivalent is therefore the more difficult problem of a laser or flashlight light scattering from the mirror sphere, for example, from the mechanical bearing ball.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|url=\n|doi= 10.1016/j.optcom.2003.08.019\n|title=More on patterns in Mie scattering\n|year=2003\n|author=M.

Let {{math|''\u03b1''}} be the angle between the [[ray (optics)|light ray]] and the [[radius]] joining the reflection point of the light ray with the center point of the circle mirror. Then the increase of the length element perpendicular to the light beam is expressed by this angle as\n:<math>\\mathrm dx = r \\cos \\alpha \\,\\mathrm d \\alpha,</math>\nthe reflection angle of this ray with respect to the incoming ray is then {{math|2''\u03b1''}}, and the scattering angle is\n:<math>\\theta = \\pi - 2 \\alpha.</math>\nThe energy or the number of photons reflected from the light beam with the intensity or density of photons {{math|''I''}} on the length {{math|d''x''}} is \n:<math>I \\,\\mathrm d \\sigma = I \\,\\mathrm dx(x) = I r \\cos \\alpha \\,\\mathrm d \\alpha = I \\frac{r}{2} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\,\\mathrm d \\theta = I \\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\theta} \\,\\mathrm d \\theta.</math>\nThe differential cross section is therefore ({{math|d''\u03a9'' {{=}} d''\u03b8''}})\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\theta} = \\frac{r}{2} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right).</math> \nAs it is seen from the behaviour of the [[sine]] function, this quantity has the maximum for the backward scattering ({{math|''\u03b8'' {{=}} \u03c0}}; the light is reflected perpendicularly and returns), and the zero minimum for the scattering from the edge of the circle directly forward ({{math|''\u03b8'' {{=}} 0}}). It confirms the intuitive expectations that the mirror circle acts like a diverging [[lens (optics)|lens]], and a thin beam is more diluted the closer it is from the edge defined with respect to the incoming direction. The total cross section can be obtained by summing (integrating) the differential section of the entire range of angles:\n:<math>\\sigma = \\int_0^{2 \\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\theta} \\,\\mathrm d \\theta = \\int_0^{2 \\pi} \\frac{r}{2} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\,\\mathrm d \\theta = \\left. -r \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right|_0^{2 \\pi} = 2 r,</math> \nso it is equal as much as the circular mirror is totally screening the two-dimensional space for the beam of light. In three dimensions for the mirror ball with the radius {{math|''r''}} it is therefore equal {{math|''\u03c3'' {{=}} \u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n=== Example 3: scattering light from a 3D spherical mirror ===\n\nWe can now use the result from the Example 2 to calculate the differential cross section for the light scattering from the perfectly reflecting sphere in three dimensions. Let us denote now the radius of the sphere as {{math|''a''}}. Let us parametrize the plane perpendicular to the incoming light beam by the cylindrical coordinates {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''\u03c6''}}. In any plane of the incoming and the reflected ray we can write now from the previous example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nr &= a \\sin \\alpha,\\\\\n\\mathrm dr &= a \\cos \\alpha \\,\\mathrm d \\alpha,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhile the impact area element is \n:<math> \\mathrm d \\sigma = \\mathrm d r(r) \\times r \\,\\mathrm d \\varphi = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\,\\mathrm d \\theta \\,\\mathrm d \\varphi.</math>\nUsing the relation for the solid angle in the spherical coordinates:\n:<math>\\mathrm d\\Omega = \\sin \\theta \\,\\mathrm d \\theta \\,\\mathrm d \\varphi</math>\nand the trigonometric identity\n:<math>\\sin \\theta = 2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right),</math>\nwe obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega} = \\frac{a^2}{4},</math> \nwhile the total cross section as we expected is\n:<math>\\sigma = \\oint_{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm d \\sigma}{\\mathrm d \\Omega} \\,\\mathrm d \\Omega = \\pi a^2.</math>\nAs one can see, it also agrees with the result from the Example 1 if the photon is assumed to be a rigid sphere of zero radius.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Nuclear cross section]]\n* [[Neutron cross section]]\n* [[Partial wave analysis]]\n* [[Scattering amplitude]]\n* [[Cross sectional area]]\n* [[Flow velocity]]\n* [[Luminosity (scattering theory)]]\n* [[Particle detector]]\n* [[Radar cross-section]]\n* [[Rutherford scattering]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2009}}\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* J.

The term encompasses a broad variety of [[legend]]s and stories, especially those considered sacred narratives. Mythological [[Mytheme|themes and elements]] occur throughout Christian literature, including recurring myths such as ascending to a mountain, the ''[[axis mundi]]'', myths of combat, [[katabasis|descent into the Underworld]], accounts of a [[dying-and-rising god]], [[Flood myth|flood stories]], stories about the founding of a tribe or city, and myths about great [[hero|heroes]] (or [[saint]]s) of the past, [[paradise]]s, and [[self-sacrifice]].\n\nVarious authors have also used it to refer to other mythological and [[allegory  | allegorical]] elements found in the [[Bible]], such as the story of the [[Leviathan]]. The term has been applied{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} to myths and legends from the [[Middle Ages]], such as the story of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], the stories of [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]], and the legends of the ''[[Parsival]]''. Multiple commentators have classified [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' as a work of Christian mythology. The term has also been applied to modern stories revolving around Christian themes and motifs, such as the writings of [[C. S. Lewis]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Madeleine L'Engle]], and [[George MacDonald]].\n\nOver the centuries, Christianity has divided into many [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s. Not all of these denominations hold the same set of sacred traditional narratives. For example, the [[books of the Bible]] accepted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]] include a number of texts and stories (such as those narrated in the [[Book of Judith]] and [[Book of Tobit]]) that many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations do not accept as [[canonical gospel|canonical]].\n\n==Attitudes==\n{{See also|Religion and mythology}}\nChristian theologian and professor of [[New Testament]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]] wrote that:<ref>{{cite book |title=KERYGMA AND MYTH by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics edited by Hans Werner Bartsch |last=Bultmann |first=Rudolf |year=2005 |publisher=Harper & Row |url=https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/the-mythological-element-in-the-message-of-the-new-testament-and-the-problem-of-its-re-interpretation-part-i/ |page=21}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe cosmology of the New Testament is essentially [[Myth|mythical]] in character. The world is viewed as a three storied structure, with the earth in the center, the heaven above, and the underworld beneath. Heaven is the abode of God and of celestial beings -- the angels. The underworld is hell, the place of torment. Even the earth is more than the scene of natural, everyday events, of the trivial round and common task. It is the scene of the supernatural activity of God and his angels on the one hand, and of Satan and his demons on the other. These supernatural forces intervene in the course of nature and in all that men think and will and do. Miracles are by no means rare. Man is not in control of his own life. Evil spirits may take possession of him. Satan may inspire him with evil thoughts. Alternatively, God may inspire his thought and guide his purposes. He may grant him heavenly visions. He may allow him to hear his word of succor or demand. He may give him the supernatural power of his Spirit. History does not follow a smooth unbroken course; it is set in motion and controlled by these supernatural powers. This \u00e6on is held in bondage by Satan, sin, and death (for \"powers\" is precisely what they are), and hastens towards its end. That end will come very soon, and will take the form of a cosmic catastrophe. It will be inaugurated by the \"woes\" of the last time. Then the Judge will come from heaven, the dead will rise, the last judgment will take place, and men will enter into eternal salvation or damnation.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Myths as traditional or sacred stories===\n[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|Saint Brendan's voyage, from a German manuscript]]\nIn its broadest academic sense, the word ''myth'' simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term \"myth\" to sacred stories.<ref>[http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm#SACRED What is a Myth?]</ref> [[Folklorists]] often go further, defining myths as \"tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters\".<ref>[http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~mmagouli/defmyth.htm#DEFINING%20MYTH Defining myth]</ref>\n\nIn [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]], ''muthos'', from which the English word ''myth'' derives, meant \"story, narrative.\" By the time of Christ, ''muthos'' had started to take on the connotations of \"fable, fiction,\"<ref>Eliade, Myth and Reality (1968), p. 162</ref> and early Christian writers often avoided calling a story from canonical scripture a \"[[myth]]\".<ref>Sullivan</ref> [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] warned [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] to have nothing to do with \"godless and silly myths\" (''beb\u0113thous kai gra\u014ddeis muthous)''.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:7}} (\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6).</ref> This negative meaning of \"myth\" passed into popular usage.<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', pp. 23</ref> Some modern Christian scholars and writers have attempted to rehabilitate the term \"myth\" outside academia, describing stories in canonical scripture (especially the Christ story) as \"true myth\"; examples include [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Andrew Greeley]].<ref group=\"n\">C. S. Lewis used the expression \"true myth\" to describe the story of Jesus Christ: \"The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths\" (C. S. Lewis, in Brown). Andrew Greeley stated: \"Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith\" (Greeley, ''Myths of Religion'', in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5).</ref> Several modern Christian writers, such as [[C.S.

These non-canonical Christian myths include legends, folktales, and elaborations on canonical Christian mythology. Christian tradition has produced a rich body of legends that were never incorporated into the official scriptures. Legends were a staple of medieval literature.<ref>Guerber, p. 2</ref> Examples include [[hagiography|hagiographies]] such as the stories of [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Valentine]]. A case in point is the historical and canonized [[Brendan|Brendan of Clonfort]], a 6th century Irish churchman and founder of abbeys. Round his authentic figure was woven a tissue that is arguably [[legend]]ary rather than historical: the ''Navigatio'' or \"Journey of Brendan\". The legend discusses mythic events in the sense of supernatural encounters. In this narrative, Brendan and his shipmates encounter sea monsters, a [[paradise|paradisal island]] and a floating ice islands and a rock island inhabited by a holy hermit: literal-minded devot\u00e9s still seek to identify \"Brendan's islands\" in actual geography.  This voyage was recreated by [[Tim Severin]], suggesting that [[whale]]s, [[iceberg]]s and [[Rockall]] were encountered.<ref>{{cite book |last=Severin |first=Timothy |authorlink=Tim Severin |title=The Brendan Voyage |date=April 1982|publisher=McGraw-Hill |id= ISBN 0070563357 }}</ref>\n\nFolktales form a major part of non-canonical Christian tradition. Folklorists define folktales (in contrast to \"true\" myths) as stories that are considered purely fictitious by their tellers and that often lack a specific setting in space or time.<ref name = \"moo\">Segal, p. 5; Zong In-Sob, p. xxi; Welker</ref> Christian-themed folktales have circulated widely among peasant populations. One widespread folktale genre is that of the Penitent Sinner (classified as Type 756A, B, C, in the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson index of tale types]]); another popular group of folktales describe a clever mortal who outwits the Devil.<ref>Degh, p. 67</ref> Not all scholars accept the folkloristic convention of applying the terms \"myth\" and \"folktale\" to different categories of traditional narrative.<ref name = \"tsrltb\">Segal, p. 5</ref>\n\nChristian tradition produced many popular stories elaborating on canonical scripture. According to an English folk belief, certain herbs gained their current healing power from having been used to heal [[Christ]]'s wounds on [[Mount Calvary]]. In this case, a non-canonical story has a connection to a non-narrative form of [[folklore]] \u2014 namely, [[folk medicine]].<ref>Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 30-31</ref> [[Arthurian legend]] contains many elaborations upon canonical mythology. For example, [[Sir Balin]] discovers the [[Lance of Longinus]], which had pierced the side of Christ.<ref>Thomas Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' 2:16</ref> According to a tradition widely attested in early Christian writings, [[Adam]]'s skull lay buried at Calvary; when Christ was crucified, his blood fell over Adam's skull, symbolizing humanity's redemption from Adam's sin.<ref>Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 375; Wilson, pp. 159-66</ref>\n\n==Things shared with Hebrew mythology==\n{{Main|Hebrew mythology}}\n* Cosmogony\n** [[Genesis creation narrative#First narrative: creation week|The 7-day creation week narrative]] (Genesis 1-2:3)\n** [[Genesis creation narrative#Second_narrative:_Eden|The Eden narrative]] (Genesis 2:4-3:24)\n** allegories for [[Satan]]'s [[The War of Heaven|revolution against God]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n* Origins\n** [[Fall of Man#Genesis|The Fall of Man]]: Although the Book of Genesis does not mention [[original sin]], many Christians interpret the Fall as the origin of original sin.\n** [[Noah's Ark]]\n** [[The Tower of Babel]]: the origin and division of nations and languages\n* The life of [[Abraham]]\n* [[The Exodus]] of the Hebrews from Egypt\n* The Hebrews' conquest of the [[Promised Land]]\n* The period of the [[Prophet#Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)|Hebrew prophets]].

Here the narrative is combined by the author with a story of how all Christian theology \"came to be\". For example the story of Jesus as the \"word\" or \"[[Logos#Use in Christianity|Logos]]\" ([[John 1:1]]), the [[incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Logos or [[Son of god#Jesus as divine|Son of God]] as the man Jesus (e.g., Luke 1:35), and Christ's [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for humanity's sins (e.g., Matthew 26:28).

Examples include [[Abgarus of Edessa]] and [[Saint George]]. Legends about saints are commonly called [[hagiographies]]. Some such stories are heavily [[miracle|miraculous]], such as those found in [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''; others, less so.\n*Stories about artifacts such as the [[Holy Grail]], [[Holy Lance]] and [[Shroud of Turin]].\n*Names and biographical details supplied for unnamed Biblical characters: see ''[[List of names for the Biblical nameless]]''\n*The legends of [[King Arthur]] and [[Matter of France|Charlemagne]] as Christian kings, notably the [[Quest]] for the [[Holy Grail]].\n*Legendary history of the [[Christian church]]es, such as the tales from the [[Crusades]] or the [[paladin]]s in medieval [[romance (genre)|romance]].\n*Legends of the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Priory of Sion]].\n*Medieval Christian stories about [[angel]]s and [[guardian angel]]s.\n*Non-canonical elaborations or amendments to Biblical tales, such as the tales of [[Salome (disciple)|Salom\u00e9]], the [[Magi|Three Wise Men]], or St. [[Dismas]].\n\n{{See also|Christian literature}}\n\n==Connections to other belief systems==\n===Zoroastrianism===\nSome scholars believe that many elements of Christian mythology, particularly its linear portrayal of time, originated with the [[Persian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>Campbell, p. 190-92</ref> [[Mary Boyce]], an authority on Zoroastrianism, writes:\n{{quote|Zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgment, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general Last Judgment, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. These doctrines were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowings by Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<ref>Boyce, p. 29</ref>}}\n\n[[Mircea Eliade]] believes the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before Zoroastrianism influenced them. However, he argues,\n\"a number of other [Jewish] religious ideas were discovered, revalorized, of systematized in Iran\". These ideas include a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil, belief in a future savior and [[resurrection]], and \"an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good\".<ref>Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302</ref>\n\n===Other connections===\nIn [[Buddhist mythology]], the demon [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] tries to distract the historical Buddha, [[Siddhartha Gautama]], before he can reach enlightenment. [[Huston Smith]], a professor of philosophy and a writer on comparative religion, notes the similarity between Mara's temptation of the Buddha before his ministry and Satan's temptation of Christ before his ministry.<ref>Smith, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn the [[Book of Revelation]], the author sees a vision of a pregnant woman in the sky being pursued by a huge red dragon. The dragon tries to devour her child when she gives birth, but the child is \"caught up to God and his throne\". This appears to be an allegory for the triumph of Christianity: the child presumably represents Christ; the woman may represent God's people of the Old and New Testaments (who produced Christ); and the Dragon symbolizes Satan, who opposes Christ.<ref>footnote on Revelation 12:1-6 in ''The New American Bible'', St Joseph Edition</ref> According to Catholic scholars, the images used in this allegory may have been inspired by pagan mythology:\n<blockquote>\"This corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster.\"<ref>footnote on Revelation 12:1-6 in ''The New American Bible'', St Joseph Edition. The footnote does not specify which pagan myths it means.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Mythical themes and types==\nAcademic studies of mythology often define mythology as deeply valued stories that explain a society's existence and world order: those narratives of a society's creation, the society's origins and foundations, their god(s), their original heroes, mankind's connection to the \"divine\", and their narratives of [[eschatology]] (what happens in the \"after-life\").  This is a very general outline of some of the basic sacred stories with those themes.\n\n===Cosmogonic myths===\nThe Christian texts use the same [[creation myth]] as [[Jewish mythology]] as written in the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis, the world was created out of a darkness and water in seven days. (Unlike a Jew, a Christian might include the miracle of Jesus' birth as a sort of second cosmogonic event)<ref>According to Mircea Eliade, \"for the Christian, time begins anew with the birth of Christ, for the Incarnation establishes a new situation of man in the cosmos\" (''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 111).</ref> Canonical Christian scripture incorporates the two Hebrew cosmogonic myths found in Genesis 1-2:2 and Genesis 2:\n\n====Genesis 1-2:3====\nIn the first text on the creation (Genesis 1-2:3), the Creator is called ''[[Elohim]]'' (translated \"God\"). He creates the universe over a six-day period, creating a new feature each day: first he creates day and night; then he creates the firmament to separate the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\"; then he separates the dry land from the water; then he creates plants on the land; then he places the sun, moon, and stars in the sky; then he creates swimming and flying animals; then he creates land animals; and finally he creates [[Adam and Eve|man and woman]] together, \"in his own image\". On the seventh day, God rests, providing the rationale for the custom of resting on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].<ref>Exodus 20:8-11</ref>\n\n====Genesis 2:4-3:24====\nThe second creation myth in Genesis differs from the first in a number of important elements. Here the Creator is called ''Yahweh elohim'' (commonly translated \"Lord God\", although [[Yahweh]] is in fact the personal name of the God of Israel and does not mean Lord).\n\nThis myth begins with the words, \"When the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> God made the earth and the heavens, and no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth ...\" (Genesis 2:4-5 NASB). It then proceeds to describe Yahweh creating a man called Adam out of dust. Yahweh creates the [[Garden of Eden]] as a home for Adam, and tells Adam not to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in the center of the Garden (next to the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]).\n\nYahweh also creates animals, and shows them to man, who names them. Yahweh sees that there is no suitable companion for the man among the beasts, and he subsequently puts Adam to sleep and takes out one of Adam's ribs, creating from it a woman whom Adam names [[Eve]].\n\nA [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] tempts Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and she succumbs, offering the fruit to Adam as well. As a punishment, Yahweh banishes the couple from the Garden and \"placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden the cherubim with a fiery revolving sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life\".<ref>Genesis 3:24</ref> The Lord says he must banish humans from the Garden because they have become like him, knowing good and evil (because of eating the [[forbidden fruit]]), and now only [[immortality]] (which they could get by eating from the Tree of Life) stands between them and godhood:\n<blockquote>\"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.

[\u2026] In other words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero, de Gozon was identified with a category, an [[archetype]], which [\u2026] equipped him with a mythical biography from which it was ''impossible'' to omit combat with a reptilian monster.\"<ref name=\"eliade39\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the ''Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' David Leeming lists Moses, Jesus, and King Arthur as examples of the [[monomyth|heroic monomyth]],<ref name=\"leemingheroicmonomyth\">Leeming, \"Heroic monomyth\"</ref> calling the Christ story \"a particularly complete example of the heroic monomyth\".<ref name=\"leemingchristianmythology\"/> Leeming regards resurrection as a common part of the heroic monomyth,<ref name=\"leemingheroicmonomyth\"/><ref>Leeming, \"Resurrection\"</ref> in which the resurrected heroes often become sources of \"material or spiritual food for their people\"; in this connection, Leeming notes that Christians regard Jesus as the \"bread of life\".<ref name=\"leemingheroicmonomyth\"/>\n\nIn terms of values, Leeming contrasts \"the myth of Jesus\" with the myths of other \"Christian heroes such as St. George, [[Song of Roland|Roland]], [[el Cid]], and even King Arthur\"; the later hero myths, Leeming argues, reflect the survival of pre-Christian heroic values\u2014\"values of military dominance and cultural differentiation and hegemony\"\u2014more than the values expressed in the Christ story.<ref name=\"leemingchristianmythology\"/>\n\n===Paradise===\n[[Image:Sirin Sunduk 1710.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|In illustrations of the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Pomors]] often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} depicted [[sirin]]s as birds sitting in [[paradise]] trees. 1710]]\nMany religious and mythological systems contain myths about a [[paradise]].

According to Christian theology, by Adam disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, humanity acquired an ingrained flaw that keeps humans in a state of moral imperfection, generally called \"original sin\". According to Paul the Apostle, Adam's sin brought sin and death to all humanity: \"Through one man, sin entered the world, and through sin, death\" (Romans 5:12). \n\nAccording to the orthodox Christian view, Jesus saved humanity from final death and damnation by dying for them. Most Christians believe that Christ's [[sacrifice]] supernaturally reversed death's power over humanity, proved when he was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], and abolished the power of sin on humanity. According to Paul, \"if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many\" (Romans 5:15). For many Christians, atonement doctrine leads naturally into the eschatological narratives of Christian people rising from the dead and living again, or immediately entering heaven to join Jesus.\n\n====Atonement in canonical scripture====\nPaul's theological writings lay out the basic framework of the atonement doctrine in the New Testament. However, Paul's letters contain relatively little mythology (narrative). The majority of narratives in the New Testament are in the Gospels and the Book of Revelation.\n\nAlthough the Gospel stories do not lay out the atonement doctrine as fully as does Paul, they do have the story of the Last Supper, crucifixion, death and resurrection. Atonement is also suggested in the parables of Jesus in his final days. According to Matthew's gospel, at the [[Last Supper]], Jesus calls his blood \"the blood of the new covenant, which will be poured out for the forgiveness of many\" (Matthew 26:28). John's gospel is especially rich in atonement parables and promises: Jesus speaks of himself as \"the living bread that came down from heaven\"; \"and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world\" (John 6:51); \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\" (John 12:24).\n\n====Atonement in non-canonical literature====\nThe sacrifice and atonement narrative appears explicitly in many non-canonical writings as well. For instance, in Book 3 of Milton's ''Paradise Lost'', the [[Son of god#Jesus as divine|Son of God]] offers to become a man and die, thereby paying mankind's debt to [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]].\n\nThe [[Harrowing of Hell]] is a non-canonical myth extrapolated from the atonement doctrine. According to this story, Christ descended into the land of the dead after his crucifixion, rescuing the righteous souls that had been cut off from heaven due to the taint of original sin. The story of the harrowing was popular during the Middle Ages. An Old English poem called \"The Harrowing of Hell\" describes Christ breaking into Hell and rescuing the Old Testament patriarchs.<ref>Russell, p. 136-38</ref> (The Harrowing is not the only explanation that Christians have put forth for the fate of the righteous who died before Christ accomplished the atonement)<ref>For example, according to Russell, pp. 205-6, the medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian [[Abelard]] believed \"that the just pagans had all been illuminated and saved by the Word during their lives\". Russell also suggests another possible explanation that the scholastic theologians did not consider: \"Christ died for all human beings wherever they are in space or time. His sacrifice was built into the plan of salvation for all eternity, and it affects those who come after the incarnation no more than those who came before\".</ref>\n\nIn modern literature, atonement continues to be theme. In the first of C. S. Lewis's ''Narnia'' novels, ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', a boy named Edmund is condemned to death by a [[White Witch]], and the magical lion-king [[Aslan]] offers to die in Edmund's place, thereby saving him. Aslan's life is sacrificed on an altar, but returns to life again. Aslan's self-sacrifice for Edmund is often interpreted as an allegory for the story of Christ's sacrifice for humanity; although Lewis denied that the novel is a mere allegory.<ref group=\"n\">A letter to a child fan named Patricia, printed in ''The Essential C.

They offer candles made of pitch or a child's umbilical cord, and kiss him on the anal orifice as a sign of homage. Sometimes they imitate the sacrifice of the Mass (the greatest of all their crimes), as well as purifying with water and similar Catholic ceremonies. After the feast, each evil spirit takes by the hand the disciple of whom he has charge, and so that they may do everything with the most absurd kind of ritual, each person bends over backwards, joins hands in a circle, and tosses his head as frenzied fanatics do. Then they begin to dance. They sing very obscene songs in his [Satan's] honour. They behave ridiculously in every way, and in every way contrary to accepted custom.

Eschatological myths would also include the prophesies of [[apocalypse|end of the world]] and a new millennium in the [[Book of Revelation]], and the story that Jesus will return to earth some day.\n\nThe major features of Christian eschatological mythology include afterlife beliefs, the Second Coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the [[last judgment|final judgment]].\n\n====Immediate afterlife (heaven and hell)====\n[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|right|''Jesus as the Good Shepherd,'' painting on ceiling of S. Callisto catacomb, early Christian art, mid 3rd century A.D.. Example of earliest Christian art showing a pastoral scene in the afterlife.]]\n\nMost Christian denominations hold some belief in an immediate afterlife when people die. Christian scripture gives a few descriptions of an immediate afterlife and a heaven and hell; however, for the most part, both New and Old Testaments focus much more on the myth of a final bodily resurrection than any beliefs about a purely spiritual afterlife away from the body.\n\nMuch of the Old Testament does not express a belief in a personal afterlife of reward or punishment:<blockquote>\"All the dead go down to Sheol, and there they lie in sleep together\u2013whether good or evil, rich or poor, slave or free (Job 3:11-19). It is described as a region \"dark and deep,\" \"the Pit,\" and \"the land of forgetfulness,\" cut off from both God and human life above (Pss. 6:5; 88:3-12). Though in some texts Yahweh's power can reach down to Sheol (Ps. 139:8), the dominant idea is that the dead are abandoned forever. This idea of Sheol is negative in contrast to the world of life and light above, but there is no idea of judgment or of reward and punishment.\"<ref>Tabor</ref></blockquote>\n\nLater Old Testament writings, particularly the works of the Hebrew prophets, describe a final resurrection of the dead, often accompanied by spiritual rewards and punishments:<blockquote>\"Many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. Some shall live forever; others shall be in everlasting contempt. But the wise shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament, and those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever\" (Daniel 12:2).</blockquote>\nHowever, even here, the emphasis is not on an immediate afterlife in heaven or hell, but rather on a future bodily resurrection.\n\nThe New Testament also devotes little attention to an immediate afterlife. Its primary focus is the resurrection of the dead. Some New Testament passages seem to mention the (non-resurrected) dead experiencing some sort of afterlife (for example, the parable of [[Lazarus and Dives]]); yet the New Testament includes only a few myths about heaven and hell. Specifically, heaven is a place of peaceful residence, where Jesus goes to \"prepare a home\" or room for his disciples (John 14:2).<ref>\"In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you\" - Jesus. John 14:2 NASB 1995.</ref> Drawing on scriptural imagery (John 10:7, John 10:11-14), many Christian narratives of heaven include a nice green pasture land and a meeting with a benevolent God. Some of the earliest Christian art depicts heaven as a green pasture where people are sheep led by Jesus as \"the good shepherd\" as in interpretation of heaven.\n\nAs the [[doctrines]] of heaven and hell and (Catholic) [[purgatory]] developed, non-canonical Christian literature began to develop an elaborate mythology about these locations. Dante's three-part ''Divine Comedy'' is a prime example of such afterlife mythology, describing Hell (in ''Inferno''), Purgatory (in ''Purgatorio''), and Heaven (in ''Paradiso''). Myths of hell differ quite widely according to the denomination.\n\n====Second Coming====\n[[File:Wandering jew.jpg|thumb|right|''The Wandering Jew '' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\nThe [[Second Coming]] of Christ holds a central place in Christian mythology. The Second Coming is the return of Christ to earth during the period of transformation preceding the end of this world and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. According to Matthew's gospel, when Jesus is on trial before the Roman and Jewish authorities, he claims, \"In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"<ref>Matthew 26:64</ref>\nThe legend of the ''[[Wandering Jew]]'' concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.\n\n====Resurrection and final judgment====\nChristian mythology incorporates the Old Testament's prophecies of a future resurrection of the dead. Like the Hebrew prophet Daniel (e.g., Daniel 12:2), the Christian Book of Revelation (among other New Testament scriptures) describes the resurrection: \"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.\"<ref>Revelation 20:13</ref> The righteous and/or faithful enjoy bliss in the earthly Kingdom of Heaven, but the evil and/or non-Christian are \"cast into the lake of fire\".<ref>Revelation 20:15</ref>\n\n====The Kingdom of Heaven on earth====\nChristian eschatological myths feature a total world renovation after the final judgment. According to the Book of Revelation, God \"will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away\".<ref>Revelation 21:4</ref> According to Old and New Testament passages, a time of perfect peace and happiness is coming: <blockquote>\"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. One nation will not raise the sword against another; nor will they train for war again.\"<ref>Isaiah 2:4</ref></blockquote> Certain scriptural passages even suggest that God will abolish the current natural laws in favor of immortality and total peace:\n*\"Then the wolf will be a guest of the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid. The calf and the young lion will browse together, with a little child to guide them. [...] There will be no harm or ruin on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with knowledge of the Lord as water fills the sea.\"<ref>Isaiah 11:6, 9</ref>\n*\"On this mountain, [God] will destroy the veil that veils all peoples, the web that is woven over all nations: he will destroy Death forever.\"<ref>Isaiah 25:7-8</ref>\n*\"The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.\"<ref>1 Corinthians 15:52</ref>\n*\"Night will be no more, nor will they need light from lamp or sun, for the Lord God shall give them light, and they shall reign forever and ever.\"<ref>Revelation 22:5</ref>\n\n====Millennialism and amillennialism====\nWhen Christianity was a new and persecuted religion, many Christians believed the end times were imminent.<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67</ref> Scholars debate whether Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher;<ref>McGinn, p. 35</ref> however, his early followers, \"the group of Jews who accepted him as messiah in the years immediately after his death, understood him in primarily apocalyptic terms\".<ref>McGinn, p. 36</ref> Prevalent in the early church and especially during periods of persecution,<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67; McGinn, p. 60</ref> this Christian belief in an imminent end is called \"[[millennialism]]\". (It takes its name from the thousand-year (\"millennial\") reign of Christ that, according to the Book of Revelation, will precede the final world renovation; similar beliefs in a coming paradise are found in other religions, and these phenomena are often also called \"millennialism\")<ref>\"millennialism\"; Eliade, p. 67-72</ref>\n\nMillennialism comforted Christians during times of persecution, for it predicted an imminent deliverance from suffering.<ref>\"millennialism\"; Eliade, p. 67</ref> From the perspective of millennialism, human action has little significance: millennialism is comforting precisely because it predicts that happiness is coming no matter what humans do: \"The seeming triumph of Evil made up the apocalyptic syndrome which was to precede Christ's return and the millennium.\"<ref>Eliade, p. 67</ref>\n\nHowever, as time went on, millennialism lost its appeal.<ref>According to Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 67: \"After becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire, Christianity condemned millennialism as heretical, although illustrious Fathers had professed it in the past. [...] The ''eschaton'' was no longer the imminent event that it had been during the persecutions.\" According to ReligiousTolerance.org, the specific variant of millennialism condemned was \"Historical Premillennialism\", which many Christians believed in during the first three centuries C.E.; the Roman Church's official anti-millennial stance is called \"Amillennialism\", and was largely established by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (Robinson). Even some of the Church Fathers who accepted historical premillennialism doubted the imminence of the End, as Christ's coming seemed less and less likely to be immediate. According to McGinn, p. 62: \"Like both Irenaeus and Hippolytus, Tertullian thought (at least for most of his career) that the end was not near.\"</ref> Christ had not returned immediately, as earlier Christians had predicted. Moreover, many Christians no longer needed the comfort that millennialism provided, for they were no longer persecuted: \"With the triumph of the Church, the Kingdom of Heaven was already present on earth, and in a certain sense the old world had already been destroyed.\"<ref name = \"bfvqcq\">Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 68</ref> (Millennialism has revived during periods of historical stress,<ref name = \"bfvqcq\"/> and is currently popular among Evangelical Christians)<ref name = \"vaqsrr\">Robinson</ref>\n\nIn the Roman Church's condemnation of millennialism, Eliade sees \"the first manifestation of the doctrine of [human] progress\" in Christianity.<ref name = \"bfvqcq\"/> According to the amillennial view, Christ will indeed come again, ushering in a perfect Kingdom of Heaven on earth, but \"the Kingdom of God is [already] present in the world today through the presence of the heavenly reign of Christ, the Bible, the Holy Spirit and Christianity\".<ref name = \"vaqsrr\"/> Amillennialists do not feel \"the eschatological tension\" that persecution inspires; therefore, they interpret their eschatological myths either figuratively or as descriptions of far-off events rather than imminent ones.<ref>According to ReligiousTolerance.org, Amillennialists interpret the myth of Christ's [[Second Coming]] literally, although they do not expect Christ to come soon, and they often interpret the [[Antichrist]] figuratively.Robinson</ref> Thus, after taking the amillennial position, the Church not only waited for God to renovate the world (as millennialists had) but also believed itself to be improving the world through human action.<ref name = \"bfvqcq\"/>\n\n==Attitudes toward time==\n[[Image:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|right|thumb|One traditional depiction of the [[cherubim]] and chariot vision, based on the description by [[Ezekiel]].]]\nAccording to [[Mircea Eliade]], many traditional societies have a cyclic sense of time, periodically reenacting mythical events.<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 72-73</ref> Through this reenactment, these societies achieve an \"[[Eternal Return (Eliade)|eternal return]]\" to the mythical age.<ref>Wendy Doniger, Forward to Eliade, ''Shamanism'', xiii</ref> According to Eliade, Christianity retains a sense of cyclical time, through the ritual commemoration of Christ's life and the imitation of Christ's actions; Eliade calls this sense of cyclical time a \"mythical aspect\" of Christianity.<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 78</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Judeo-Christian]] thought also makes an \"innovation of the first importance\", Eliade says, because it embraces the notion of linear, historical time; in Christianity, \"time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time\".<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 65. See also Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 79</ref> Summarizing Eliade's statements on this subject, Eric Rust writes, \"A new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions\u2014Judaism, Christianity, Islam\u2014history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. [...] The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.\"<ref>Rust 60</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the myths of many traditional cultures present a cyclic or static view of time. In these cultures, all the \"[important] history is limited to a few events that took place in the mythical times\".<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 190</ref> In other words, these cultures place events into two categories, the mythical age and the present, between which there is no continuity. Everything in the present is seen as a direct result of the mythical age:\n<blockquote>\"Just as modern man considers himself to be constituted by [all of] History, the man of the archaic societies declares that he is the result of [only] a certain number of mythical events.\"<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 11-12</ref></blockquote>\nBecause of this view, Eliade argues, members of many traditional societies see their lives as a constant repetition of mythical events, an \"[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]\" to the mythical age: <blockquote>\"In ''imitating'' the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.\"<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 23</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Eliade, Christianity shares in this cyclic sense of time to an extent. \"By the very fact that it is a religion\", he argues, Christianity retains at least one \"mythical aspect\" \u2014 the repetition of mythical events through ritual.<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 168-69</ref> Eliade gives a typical church service as an example:<blockquote>\"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present\u2014the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets\u2014but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.\"<ref>Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 72</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Heinrich Zimmer]] also notes Christianity's emphasis on linear time; he attributes this emphasis specifically to the influence of Saint Augustine's theory of history.<ref>Zimmer 19</ref> Zimmer does not explicitly describe the cyclical conception of time as itself \"mythical\" per se, although he notes that this conception \"underl[ies] Hindu mythology\".<ref>Zimmmer 20</ref>\n\nNeil Forsyth writes that \"what distinguishes both Jewish and Christian religious systems [...] is that they elevate to the sacred status of myth narratives that are situated in historical time\".<ref>Forsyth 9</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Concepts of progress===\nAccording to [[Carl Mitcham]], \"the Christian mythology of progress toward transcendent salvation\" created the conditions for modern ideas of scientific and technological progress.<ref>Mitcham, in Davison 70</ref> [[Hayden White]] describes \"the myth of Progress\" as the \"secular, Enlightenment counterpart\" of \"Christian myth\".<ref>White 65</ref> [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] described the modern idea of ethical and scientific progress as \"really a rationalized version of the Christian myth of salvation\".<ref>Naveh 42</ref>\n\nAccording to Irwin, from the perspective of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Old Testament), \"history is a tale of progress\".<ref>Irwin, p. 323</ref> Christianity inherited the Hebrew sense of history through the Old Testament. Thus, although most Christians believe that human nature is inherently \"fallen\" (see [[original sin]]) and cannot become perfected without divine grace, they do believe that the world can and will change for the better, either through human and divine action or through divine action alone.\n\n===Political and philosophical ideas===\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the medieval \"Gioacchinian myth [...] of universal renovation in a more or less imminent future\" has influenced a number of modern theories of history, such as those of Lessing (who explicitly compares his views to those of medieval \"enthusiasts\"), [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]; and has also influenced a number of Russian writers.<ref name=\"eliade84-85\"/>\n\nCalling [[Marxism]] \"a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology\", Eliade writes that Marxism \"takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the [[proletariat]]), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world\".<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', in Ellwood 91\u201392</ref>\n\nIn his article \"The Christian Mythology of Socialism\", [[Will Herberg]] argues that socialism inherits the structure of its ideology from the influence of Christian mythology upon western thought.<ref>Herberg 131</ref>\n\nIn ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'', David Leeming claims that Judeo-Christian messianic ideas have influenced 20th-century totalitarian systems, citing the [[state ideology of the Soviet Union]] as an example.<ref>Leeming, \"Religion and myth\"</ref>\n\nAccording to Hugh S. Pyper, the biblical \"founding myths of the Exodus and the exile, read as stories in which a nation is forged by maintaining its ideological and racial purity in the face of an oppressive great power\", entered \"the rhetoric of nationalism throughout European history\", especially in Protestant countries and smaller nations.<ref>Pyper 333</ref>\n\n=== Christmas stories in popular culture ===\nChristmas stories have become prevalent in Western literature and culture.\n{{Further|Secular Christmas stories|Christmas in the media|Christmas in literature}}\n\n==The Bible==\n===Old Testament===\n[[Image:Destruction of Leviathan.png|right|thumb|''Destruction of [[Leviathan]]''. 1865 engraving by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nMythic patterns such as the primordial struggle between good and evil appear in passages throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]], including passages that describe historical events.<ref name=\"mcginn18-20\">McGinn 18-20</ref> A distinctive characteristic of the Hebrew Bible is the reinterpretation of myth on the basis of history, as in the [[Book of Daniel]], a record of the experience of the Jews of the Second Temple period under foreign rule, presented as a prophecy of future events and expressed in terms of \"mythic structures\" with \"the Hellenistic kingdom figured as a terrifying monster that cannot but recall [the Near Eastern pagan myth of] the dragon of chaos\".<ref name=\"mcginn18-20\"/>\n\n[[Mircea Eliade]] argues that the imagery used in some parts of the Hebrew Bible reflects a \"transfiguration of history into myth\".<ref>Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', 37</ref> For example, Eliade says, the portrayal of [[Nebuchadnezzar]] as a dragon in Jeremiah 51:34 is a case in which the Hebrews \"interpreted contemporary events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a hero and a dragon.<ref name=\"Eliade, Cosmos and History, 38\">Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', 38</ref>\n\nAccording to scholars including Neil Forsyth and [[John L.

They add, \"One could [...] say this story was written in reaction to creation myths of nearby cultures [...] In other Near Eastern mythologies, the sun and moon are gods who have names and rule. P [i.e. the textual source from which Genesis 1 is drawn] tells of their creation on the fourth day as simply luminaries without name or function except to keep time.

[...] The act of creation is achieved in entire tranquility\" (McKenzie 57).</ref> In connection with this interpretation, David and Margaret Leeming describe Genesis 1 as a \"demythologized myth\",<ref>Leeming, ''A Dictionary of Creation Myths'', 116; see also Leeming 115</ref> and John L.

Later the theology was carried north by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks|Frankish]] people, and Christian themes began to weave into the framework of European [[mythology|mythologies]].<ref>Eliade 1963:162-181</ref> The pre-Christian [[Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Celtic mythology]] that were native to the tribes of Northern Europe were denounced and submerged, while saint myths, Mary stories, [[Crusade]] myths, and other Christian myths took their place. However, pre-Christian myths never went entirely away, they mingled with the (Roman Catholic) Christian framework to form new stories, like myths of the [[mythological kings]] and [[saints]] and [[miracle]]s, for example (Eliade 1963:162-181). Stories such as that of [[Beowulf]] and Icelandic, Norse, and Germanic sagas were reinterpreted somewhat, and given Christian meanings. The legend of [[King Arthur]] and the quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is a striking example.<ref>Treharne 1971</ref> The thrust of incorporation took on one of two directions. When Christianity was on the advance, pagan myths were Christianized; when it was in retreat, Bible stories and Christian saints lost their mythological importance to the culture.\n===Middle Ages===\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the [[Middle Ages]] witnessed \"an upwelling of mythical thought\" in which each social group had its own \"mythological traditions\".<ref name=\"eliade82\">Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 82</ref> Often a profession had its own \"origin myth\" which established models for members of the profession to imitate; for example, the knights tried to imitate [[Lancelot]] or [[Percival|Parsifal]].<ref name=\"eliade82\"/> The medieval [[trouveres]] developed a \"mythology of woman and Love\" which incorporated Christian elements but, in some cases, ran contrary to official church teaching.<ref name=\"eliade82\"/>\n\nGeorge Every includes a discussion of medieval legends in his book ''Christian Mythology''. Some medieval legends elaborated upon the lives of Christian figures such as Christ, the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and the saints. For example, a number of legends describe miraculous events surrounding Mary's birth and her marriage to Joseph.<ref group=\"n\">According to one legend, Anna, Christ's maternal grandmother, initially cannot conceive; in response to Anna's lament, an angel appears and tells her that she will have a child (Mary) who will be spoken of throughout the world (Every 76-77). Some medieval legends about Mary's youth describe her as living \"a life of ideal asceticism\", fed by angels. In these legends, an angel tells Zacharias, the future father of John the Baptist, to assemble the local widowers; after the widowers have been assembled, some miracle indicates that, among them, Joseph is to be Mary's wife (according to one version of the legend, a dove comes from Joseph's rod and settles on his head) (Every 78).</ref>\n\nIn many cases, medieval mythology appears to have inherited elements from myths of pagan gods and heroes.<ref>Every 94, 96</ref><ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 162-181</ref> According to Every, one example may be \"the myth of [[Saint George|St. George]]\" and other stories about saints battling dragons, which were \"modelled no doubt in many cases on older representations of the creator and preserver of the world in combat with chaos\".<ref>Every 95</ref> Eliade notes that some \"mythological traditions\" of medieval knights, namely the [[King Arthur|Arthurian cycle]] and the [[Holy Grail|Grail theme]], combine a veneer of Christianity with traditions regarding the [[Celtic Otherworld]].<ref name=\"eliade82\"/> According to Lorena Laura Stookey, \"many scholars\" see a link between stories in \"Irish-Celtic mythology\" about journeys to the Otherworld in search of a cauldron of rejuvenation and medieval accounts of the quest for the Holy Grail.<ref>Stookey 153</ref>\n\nAccording to Eliade, \"[[eschatological myth]]s\" became prominent during the Middle Ages during \"certain historical movements\".<ref name=\"eliade83\">Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 83</ref> These eschatological myths appeared \"in the [[Crusade]]s, in the movements of a [[Tanchelm]] and an [[Eudes de l'Etoile]], in the elevation of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick II]] to the rank of Messiah, and in many other collective messianic, utopian, and prerevolutionary phenomena\".<ref name=\"eliade83\"/> One significant eschatological myth, introduced by [[Joachim of Fiore|Gioacchino da Fiore]]'s theology of history, was the \"myth of an imminent third age that will renew and complete history\" in a \"reign of the Holy Spirit\"; this \"Gioacchinian myth\" influenced a number of messianic movements that arose in the late Middle Ages.<ref name=\"eliade84-85\">Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', vol. 1, 84-85</ref>\n\n===Renaissance and Reformation===\nDuring the Renaissance, there arose a critical attitude that sharply distinguished between [[Sacred Tradition|apostolic tradition]] and what George Every calls \"subsidiary mythology\"\u2014popular legends surrounding saints, relics, the cross, etc.\u2014suppressing the latter.<ref>Every 21</ref>\n[[File:San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna, unicorn.jpg|right|thumb|[[Unicorn]] [[mosaic]] on a 1213  church floor in [[Ravenna]]]]\nThe works of Renaissance writers often included and expanded upon Christian and non-Christian stories such as those of creation and the [[Fall of man|Fall]]. Rita Oleyar describes these writers as \"on the whole, reverent and faithful to the primal myths, but filled with their own insights into the nature of God, man, and the universe\".<ref name =\"oleyar40-41\">Oleyar 40-41</ref> An example is [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', an \"epic elaboration of the Judeo-Christian mythology\" and also a \"veritable encyclopedia of myths from the Greek and Roman tradition\".<ref name =\"oleyar40-41\"/>\n\nAccording to Cynthia Stewart, during the Reformation, the Protestant reformers used \"the [[founding myth]]s of Christianity\" to critique the church of their time.<ref>Stewart 72-73</ref>\n\nEvery argues that \"the disparagement of myth in our own civilization\" stems partly from objections to perceived idolatry, objections which intensified in the Reformation, both among Protestants and among Catholics reacting against the classical mythology revived during the Renaissance.<ref>Every 11</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment===\nThe [[philosophes]] of the Enlightenment used criticism of myth as a vehicle for veiled criticisms of the Bible and the church.<ref>Lincoln 49</ref> According to [[Bruce Lincoln]], the philosophes \"made irrationality the hallmark of myth and constituted philosophy\u2014rather than the Christian ''[[kerygma]]''\u2014as the antidote for mythic discourse. By implication, Christianity could appear as a more recent, powerful, and dangerous instance of irrational myth\".<ref>Lincoln 50</ref>\n\nSince the end of the 18th century, the biblical stories have lost some of their mythological basis to western society, owing to the scepticism of the [[enlightenment age|Enlightenment]], 19th-century [[freethinkers|freethinking]], and 20th century [[modernism]]. Most westerners no longer found Christianity to be their primary imaginative and mythological framework by which they understand the world. However other scholars believe mythology is in our psyche, and that mythical influences of Christianity are in many of our ideals, for example the Judeo-Christian idea of an after-life and heaven.<ref>Eliade 1963:184</ref> The book ''[[Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X]]'' by [[Tom Beaudoin]] explores the premise that Christian mythology is present in the mythologies of pop-culture, such as Madonna's ''[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]'' or Soundgarden's ''[[Black Hole Sun]].'' Modern myths are strong in comic book stories (as stories of [[culture hero]]es) and detective novels as myths of good versus evil.<ref>Eliade 1963:185</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\nSome commentators have categorized a number of modern fantasy works as \"Christian myth\" or \"Christian [[mythopoeia]]\".

Early incorporated entities were established by [[charter]] (i.e. by an ''ad hoc'' act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through [[List of company registers|registration]].  Corporations enjoy limited liability for their investors, which can lead to losses being externalized from investors to the government or general public.<ref name=\"Known\">{{cite journal|title=Limited Liability and the Known Unknown|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=2018|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121519}}</ref>\n\nCorporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue [[stock]] or not, or by whether they are formed to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] or not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corpnet.com/types-of-corporations/#gfp|title=Types Of Corporations {{!}} Incorporate A Business|website=www.corpnet.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWhere local law distinguishes corporations by the ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as \"stock corporations\", ownership of the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as \"stockholders\" or \"shareholders\". Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as \"non-stock\" corporations; those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a \"member\" of the corporation.\n\nCorporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as \"for profit\" and \"not-for-profit\" corporations, respectively.\n\nThere is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock<!-- non-stock -->. To simplify the explanation, whenever \"[[Shareholder|Stockholder]]\" or \"[[shareholder]]\" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as \"member\" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation.\n\nRegistered corporations have [[legal personality]] and their shares are owned by shareholders<ref>{{cite book |title=Company Law |last1=Pettet |first1=B.

Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a [[board of directors]] to control the corporation in a [[fiduciary]] capacity.  In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.\n\nIn [[American English]], the word ''corporation'' is most often used to describe large [[Corporate law|business corporations]].<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/corporation corporation]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 07, 2012.</ref> In [[British English]] and in the [[Commonwealth countries]], the term ''company'' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word ''corporation'' encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word ''company'' can include entities such as [[partnership]]s that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a [[separate legal entity]].\n\nLate in the 19th century, a new form of company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]]'' or ''GmbH''. In the last quarter of the 20th Century this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the ''[[limited liability company]]'' or ''LLC''. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of oldest companies}}\n[[File: Stora Kopparberg 1288.jpg|thumb|1/8 share of the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mine, dated June 16, 1288.]]\nThe word \"corporation\" derives from ''corpus'', the [[Latin]] word for body, or a \"body of people\". By the time of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (reigned 527\u2013565), [[Roman law]] recognized a range of corporate entities under the names ''universitas'', ''corpus'' or ''collegium''. These included the state itself (the ''Populus Romanus''), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a [[Cult (religious practice)|religious cult]], [[Burial society|burial clubs]], political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.<ref>Harold Joseph Berman, ''Law and Revolution'' (vol. 1)'': The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983, pp. 215\u201316. {{ISBN|0674517768}}</ref>\n\nEntities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in [[ancient Rome]], and the [[Maurya Empire]] in ancient India.<ref>Vikramaditya S.

The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mining community in [[Falun]], [[Sweden]], obtained a [[charter]] from King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] in 1347.\n\nIn medieval times, traders would do business through [[common law]] constructs, such as [[partnership]]s. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose.

Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the Dutch East India Company defeated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and established itself in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan Islands]] in order to profit from the [[Europe]]an demand for [[spice]]s. Investors in the VOC had issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Shareholders were also explicitly granted [[limited liability]] in the company's royal charter.<ref>Om Prakash, ''European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998).</ref>\n\nIn England, the government created corporations under a [[royal charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament]] with the grant of a [[monopoly]] over a specified territory. The best-known example, established in 1600, was the [[East India Company]] of [[London]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became [[Company rule in India|increasingly integrated]] with English and later British military and colonial policy, just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the [[Royal Navy]]'s ability to control trade routes.\n\nLabeled by both contemporaries and historians as \"the grandest society of merchants in the universe\", the English East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative.<ref>John Keay, ''The Honorable Company: A History of the English East India Company'' (MacMillan, New York 1991).</ref> On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the [[East Indies]] and [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~gerard/romanticpolitics/britisheastindia.html|title=British East India Company|first=Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud, Stephanie Metz, Jody Dunville, Shannon Heath, Julia P.

Its first stock offering in 1713\u20131716 raised \u00a3418,000, its second in 1717\u20131722 raised \u00a31.6 million.<ref>''Ibid.'' at p. 113</ref>\n\n[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|left|Chart of the [[South Sea Company]]'s stock prices. The rapid inflation of the stock value in the 1710s led to the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which restricted the establishment of companies without a [[royal charter]].]]\nA similar [[chartered company]], the [[South Sea Company]], was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed in 1713 as a settlement following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which gave [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] an ''[[asiento]]'' to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from [[Corporate promoter|company promoters]] bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the [[Government debt|public debt]] of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had \"burst\", and the share price sank from \u00a31000 to under \u00a3100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter.\n\nIn the late 18th century, [[Stewart Kyd]], the author of the first treatise on [[corporate law]] in English, defined a corporation as:\n\n{{quote|a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having [[perpetual succession]] under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.|A Treatise on the Law of Corporations, Stewart Kyd (1793\u20131794)}}\n\n===Modern company law===\nDue to the late 18th century abandonment of [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory and the rise of [[classical liberalism]] and [[laissez-faire]] economic theory due to a revolution in [[economics]] led by [[Adam Smith]] and other economists, corporations transitioned from being government or [[guild]] affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of governmental directions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://political-economy.com/adam-smith-laissez-faire/|title=Adam Smith Laissez-Faire|website=political-economy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}</ref>\n\nAdam Smith wrote in his 1776 work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.<ref>A Smith, ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), Book V, ch 1, para 107.</ref>\n\n====Deregulation====\n[[File: Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|\"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock\", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]\nThe British Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825. By this point, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity.<ref>See [[Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825]], 6 Geo 4, c 91</ref> The repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions, though business ventures (such as those chronicled by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'') under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, proverbial operations like the \"Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company\" were undercapitalised ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters.<ref>See [[C Dickens]], ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' (1843) [[s:Martin Chuzzlewit/Chapter 27|ch 27]]</ref>\n\nThe process of [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] was possible only through a [[royal charter]] or a [[local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private act]] and was limited, owing to Parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as [[Voluntary association|unincorporated associations]] with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent [[Lawsuit|litigation]] had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies.\n\nThen, in 1843, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] became the chairman of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], regarded as the first modern piece of company law.<ref>''Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies'' (1844) in ''British Parliamentary Papers'', vol. VII</ref> The Act created the [[Registrar of Companies|Registrar of Joint Stock Companies]], empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost \u00a35 and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another \u00a35. For the first time in history, it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQflMqcZyOoC|title=Introduction to Company Law|author=Paul Lyndon Davies|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1}}</ref> The advantage of establishing a company as a [[Legal personality|separate legal person]] was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled.\n\n====Limited liability====\nHowever, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company.<ref>''Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co., Greenwood's Case'' (1854) 3 De GM&G 459</ref> The next, crucial development, then, was the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr. [[Robert Lowe]]. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company \u2013 [[shareholder]]s were still liable directly to [[creditor]]s, but just for the unpaid portion of their [[share (finance)|shares]]. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844).\n\nThe 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance|Insurance companies]] were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]].\n\nThis prompted the English periodical ''[[The Economist]]'' to write in 1855 that \"never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated. \"<ref>Graeme G.

This was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which remained in force for the rest of the century, up to and including the time of the decision in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd]]''.<ref>''[[Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd]]'' [1897] AC 22</ref>\n\nThe legislation shortly gave way to a railway boom, and from then, the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century, depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses.\n\n====Further developments====\n[[File:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lindley LJ]] was the leading expert on partnerships and company law in the ''[[Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' case. The landmark case confirmed the [[corporate identity|distinct corporate identity]] of the company.]]\nIn 1892, [[Germany]] introduced the [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]] with a separate [[legal personality]] and limited liability even if all the shares of the company were held by only one person. This inspired other countries to introduce corporations of this kind.\n\nThe last significant development in the history of companies was the 1897 decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon & Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.\n\nIn the [[United States]], forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century. Many private firms, such as [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s steel company and [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]], avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a [[Trust law|trust]]). State governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century, although these were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power.<ref name=\"Corporate Law textbook\">{{Citation|last1=Smiddy|first1=Linda O.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Lawrence A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations: Cases, Materials, Problems|publisher=LexisNexis|year=2010|edition=Seventh|pages=228\u201331, 241|isbn=978-1-4224-7659-8}}</ref>\n\n[[New Jersey]] was the first state to adopt an \"enabling\" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzqaBv7X_sC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=%22new+jersey%22+%22first+state%22+%22business+corporation%22&source=web&ots=n5Af0liBo5&sig=A2RRh_zOyS7W3CCMK4ZyG6Scmwk The Law of Business Organizations], Cengage Learning</ref> in 1896. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.<ref name = \"Corporate Law textbook\"/>\n\nThe end of the 19th century saw the emergence of [[Holding company|holding companies]] and corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. Countries began enacting [[Competition law|anti-trust]] laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections.\nThe 20th century saw a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations by registration across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward [[privatization]], the selling of publicly owned (or 'nationalised') services and enterprises to corporations. [[Deregulation]] (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy.\n\n==Ownership and control==\nA corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a [[joint-stock company]] the members are known as shareholders and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company, is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings.\n\nIn another kind of corporation, the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine who the corporation's members are. Who a member is depends on what kind of corporation is involved. In a [[worker cooperative]], the members are people who work for the cooperative. In a [[credit union]], the members are people who have accounts with the credit union.<ref>{{cite book |title=Principles of Finance |first1=Scott |last1=Besley |first2=Eugene |last2=Brigham |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=9780324655889 |edition=4th |page=105 }}</ref>\n\nThe day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members. In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of committee structure.\n* A single committee known as a [[board of directors]] is the method favored in most [[common law]] countries. Under this model, the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company.\n* A two-tiered committee structure with a [[supervisory board]] and a [[Vorstand|managing board]] is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Company & Commercial \u2013 Netherlands: In a nutshell \u2013 one-tier boards |date=10 April 2012 |publisher=International Law Office |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f4815d3b-0de3-44d3-81d8-16114b49b8d8}}</ref>\n\n===Formation===\nHistorically, corporations were created by a charter granted by government. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a [[registered agent]] (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an [[Law of agency|agent]] or other legal representative of the corporation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nGenerally, a corporation files [[articles of incorporation]] with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create [[By-law|bylaws]] that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a [[foreign corporation]], and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to [[employment]], [[crime]]s, [[contract]]s, [[Lawsuit|civil actions]], and the like.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Naming===\nCorporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, \"The President and Fellows of Harvard College\". Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, \"12345678 Ontario Limited\"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.\n\nIn most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, \"Incorporated\" or \"Inc.\" in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, \"Limited\" or \"Ltd.\"). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others they are not.<ref>The U.S. state of California is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and Ann Yvonne Walker, ''Marsh's California Corporation Law'', 4th ed., vol. 1 (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004), 5\u201315 \u2014 5\u201316.</ref> Their use puts everybody on [[constructive notice]] that they are dealing with an entity whose [[legal liability|liability]] is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.\n\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word \"'''company'''\" alone to denote corporate status, since the word \"[[company]]\" may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a [[sole proprietorship]] but this is not generally the case elsewhere).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Personhood==\nDespite not being individual human beings, corporations, as far as US law is concerned, are [[Legal personality|legal persons]], and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as natural persons do. For example, a corporation can own property, and can sue or be sued. Corporations can exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Human Rights of Companies: Exploring the Structure of ECHR Protection |first1=Marius |last1=Emberland |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-928983-7 |page=1 |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617104051/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Sect.8, especially Art.(4)</ref> and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations.<ref>Phillip I.

It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]\u2013based [[video game console]], and the first console to use a [[microprocessor]]. It was launched as the '''Video Entertainment System''', or '''VES''', but when [[Atari]] released its [[Atari 2600|VCS]] the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS.<ref name=\"jones123\" />\n\n==The console==\nThe Channel F electronics were designed by [[Jerry Lawson (engineer)|Jerry Lawson]] using the [[Fairchild F8]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the first public outing of this processor. The F8 was very complex compared to the typical integrated circuits of the day, and had more inputs and outputs than other contemporary chips. Because chip packaging was not available with enough pins, the F8 was instead fabricated as a pair of chips that had to be used together to form a complete CPU.\n\nLawson worked with Nick Talesfore and Ron Smith. As manager of Industrial Design, Talesfore was responsible for the design of the hand controllers, console, and video game cartridges. Smith was responsible for the mechanical engineering of the video cartridges and controllers. All worked for Wilf Corigan, head of Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera & Instrument.\n\n[[File:Fairchild Channel F test picture.png|250px|thumb|right| The [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of the Channel F]] The graphics are quite basic by modern standards. The Channel F is only able to use one plane of graphics and one of four background colors per line, only three plot colors to choose from (red, green, and blue) that turned into white if the background is set to black, at a resolution of 128 \u00d7 64, with approximately 102 \u00d7 58 pixels visible and help from only 64 bytes of system RAM, half the amount of the [[Atari 2600]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/3/31/FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725180144/http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/3/31/FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_1of3.gif |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/5/55/FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725180151/http://classicdev.org/images/thumb/5/55/FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png/1280px-FVE100_schematic_sheet_2of3.png |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}</ref> The F8 processor at the heart of the console is able to produce enough AI to allow for player versus computer matches, a first in console history. All previous machines required a human opponent. Tic-Tac-Toe on Videocart 1 had this feature, it was only for one player against the machine.\n\nOne feature unique to this console is the 'hold' button, which allow the player to freeze the game, change the time or change the speed of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=890 |title=Old-Computers.com |accessdate=10 December 2010}}</ref> The functions printed on the console is how they work in the built-in games and also some of the original games, all buttons (except reset) are controlled by the programming and can be used for anything the programmer decides. The hold function is not universal (like the hardwired reset). In the original unit, sound is played through an internal speaker, rather than the TV set. However, the System II passed sound to the television through the RF modulator.\n\n==Controllers==\nThe controllers are a joystick without a base; the main body is a large hand grip with a triangular \"cap\" on top, the top being the portion that actually moved for eight-way directional control. It could be used as both a joystick and paddle (twist), and not only could it be pushed down to operate as a fire button it could be pulled up as well.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=Fairchild Channel F Video Entertainment System: The first modern game console|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/66-fairchild-channel-f-video-entertainment-system-the-first-modern-game-console|publisher=The Rev.

The System II featured detachable controllers and had two holders at the back to wind the cable around and to store the controller in. [[Zircon (company)|Zircon]] later offered a special control which featured an action button on the front of the joystick. It was marketed by Zircon as \"Channel F Jet-Stick\" in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas 1982.<ref>http://fndcollectables.com/CHANNEL_F_INFO/U_S_/Adds___Offers/LETTERS/x82fr1f.jpg</ref>\n\nDespite the failure of the Channel F, the joystick's design was so popular\u2014''[[Creative Computing]]'' called it \"outstanding\"\u2014 that Zircon also released an [[Atari joystick port]]-compatible version, the Video Command Joystick,<ref name=\"ccvag1983spring\">{{Citation | first = David H. | last = Ahl | author-link = David H.

Several of these cartridges were capable of playing more than one game and were typically priced at $19.95. The Videocarts were yellow and approximately the size and overall texture of an [[8 track cartridge]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven L.|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|year=2001|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-7615-3643-4}}</ref> They usually featured colorful label artwork. The earlier artwork was created by nationally known artist Tom Kamifuji and art directed by Nick Talesfore.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The console contained two built-in games, Tennis and Hockey, which were both advanced ''[[Pong]]'' clones. In Hockey the reflecting bar could be changed to diagonals by twisting the controller, and could move all over the playing field. Tennis was much like the original Pong.\n\nA sales brochure from 1978 listed 'Keyboard Videocarts' for sale. The three shown were ''K-1 Casino Poker'', ''K-2 Space Odyssey'', and ''K-3 Pro-Football''. These were intended to use the Keyboard accessory. All further brochures, released after Zircon took over Fairchild, never listed this accessory nor anything called a Keyboard Videocart.\n\nThere was one additional cartridge released numbered Videocart-51 and simply titled 'Demo 1'. This Videocart was shown in a single sales brochure released shortly after Zircon acquired the company. It was never listed for sale after this single brochure which was used in the winter of 1979.\n\n===List of games===\nNames according to the cartridge, not the packaging.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Developer\n!Publisher\n!Year\n!Genre\n|-\n|Democart\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n| Sep 1977\n|Educational\n|-\n|Hockey (Integrated)\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|1976\n|Sports\n|-\n|Tennis (Integrated)\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|1976\n|Sports\n|-\n|Videocart-01: Tic-Tac-Toe, Shooting Gallery, Doodle, Quadra-Doodle\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1976\n|Trivia, Shooter\n|-\n|Videocart-02: Desert Fox, Shooting Gallery\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1976\n|Action, Shooter\n|-\n|Videocart-03: Video Blackjack\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1976\n|Gambling\n|-\n|Videocart-04: Spitfire\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Action, Shooter\n|-\n|Videocart-05: Space War\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Action, Shooter\n|-\n|Videocart-06: Math Quiz I (Addition & Subtraction)\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Educational\n|-\n|Videocart-07: Math Quiz II (Multiplication & Division)\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Educational\n|-\n|Videocart-08: Magic Numbers (Mind Reader & Nim)\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Trivia\n|-\n|Videocart-09: Drag Race\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1976\n|Racing\n|-\n|Videocart-10: Maze, Jailbreak, Blind man's bluff, Trailblazer\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Maze\n|-\n|Videocart-11: Backgammon, Acey-Deucey\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Trivia\n|-\n|Videocart-12: Baseball\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Sports\n|-\n|Videocart-13: Robot War, Torpedo Alley\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Platform, Action\n|-\n|Videocart-14: Sonar Search\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1977\n|Strategy\n|-\n|Videocart-15: Memory Match 1, Memory Match 2\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Puzzle\n|-\n|Videocart-16: Dodge' It\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Platform, Action\n|-\n|Videocart-17: Pinball Challenge\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Pinball\n|-\n|Videocart-18: Hangman\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Puzzle\n|-\n|Videocart-19: Checkers\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1980\n|Trivia\n|-\n|Videocart-20: Video Whizball\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Miscellaneous\n|-\n|Videocart-21: Bowling\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1978\n|Sports\n|-\n|Videocart-22: Slot Machine\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1980\n|Gambling\n|-\n|Videocart-23: Galactic Space Wars\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1980\n|Action, Shooter\n|-\n|Videocart-24: Pro Football\n|Fairchild\n|Fairchild\n|12-31-1981\n|Sports\n|-\n|Videocart-25: Casino Poker\n|Fairchild\n|Zircon\n|12-31-1980\n|Gambling\n|-\n|Videocart-26: Alien Invasion\n|Fairchild\n|Zircon\n|12-31-1981\n|Action, Shooter\n|}\n\nCarts listed (as mentioned above) but never released:\n*Keyboard Videocart-1: Casino Poker\n*Keyboard Videocart-2: Space Odyssey\n*Keyboard Videocart-3: Pro-Football\n\nOfficial carts that also exist:\n*Democart 2\n\nGerman [[SABA (electronics manufacturer)|SABA]] also released a few compatible carts different from the original carts, translation in Videocart 1 Tic-Tac-Toe to German words, Videocart 3 released with different abbreviations (German), Videocart 18 changed graphics and German word list and the SABA 20, a chess game released only by SABA.\n\nA [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] clone of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' for the Channel F was released in 2009.<ref>[http://www.consolecity.com/games/action-game_info/game_id-29406.html ConsoleCity.com || Channel F - Videocart 27: Pac-Man (USC)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Ken Uston]] reviewed 32 games in his book ''[[Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games]]'' in 1982, and rated some of the Channel F's titles highly; of these, ''Alien Invasion'' and ''Video Whizball'' were considered by Uston to be \"the finest adult cartridges currently available for the Fairchild Channel F System.\"<ref>Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.605</ref> The games on a whole, however, rated last on his survey of over 200 games for the Atari, Intellivision, Astrocade and Odyssey consoles, and contemporary games were rated \"Average\" with future Channel F games rated \"below average\".<ref>Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.20.</ref> Uston rated almost one half of the Channel F games as \"high in interest\" and called that \"an impressive proportion\" and further noted that \"Some of the Channel F cartridges are timeless; no matter what technological developments occur, they will continue to be of interest.\" His overall conclusion was that the games \"serve a limited, but useful, purpose\" and that the \"strength of the Channel F offering is in its excellent educational line for children.\"<ref>Uston, Ken. ''Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games'' (Signet, 1982) p.603 and p.23.</ref>\n\nIn 1983, after Zircon announced its discontinuation of the Channel F, ''Video Games'' reviewed the console. Calling it \"the system nobody knows\", the magazine described its graphics and sounds as \"somewhat primitive by today's standards\". It described ''Space War'' as perhaps \"the most antiquated game of its type still on the market\", and rated the 25 games for the console with an average grade of three (\"not too good\") on a scale from one to ten. The magazine stated, however, that Fairchild \"managed to create some fascinating games, even by today's standards\", calling ''Casino Royale'' (''Video Blackjack'') \"the best card game, from blackjack to bridge, made for ''any'' TV-game system\". It also favorably reviewed ''Dodge-It'' (\"simple but great\"), ''Robot War'' (\"Berzerk without guns\"), and ''Whizball'' (\"thoroughly original ... hockey ''with'' guns\"), but concluded that only those interested in nostalgia, [[video game collecting]], or card games would purchase the Channel F in 1983.<ref name=\"dionne198303\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n71/mode/2up | title=Channel F: The System Nobody Knows | work=Video Games | date=March 1983 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Dionne, Roger | pages=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\n==Technical specifications==\n[[File:Grandstand-video-entertainment-computer-pcb.jpg|thumb|PCB Scan of the Grandstand Video Entertainment Computer (UK Channel F II variant).]]\nOriginal Channel F technical specifications:\n* [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[microprocessor]]: [[Fairchild F8]] ([[8-bit]])<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg70-fairchild.htm Fairchild Channel F | Video Game Console Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Clock rate|operating]] at 1.7897725&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]] ([[NTSC]]) ([[PAL]] gen. 1: 2.0000&nbsp;MHz, PAL gen. 2: 1.7734475&nbsp;MHz)\n* [[Random-access memory|RAM]]: 2 [[kilobyte|KB]] (128\u00d764\u00d72 bits)<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=oK3D4i5ldKgC&pg=PA65 Before the Crash: Early Video Game History - Mark J.

This re-designed System II was completed by Nick Talesfore at Fairchild. He was the same industrial designer who designed the original game console. Only six new games were released after the debut of the second system before its demise, several of which were developed at Fairchild before they sold it off.\n\nThe major changes were in design, with the controllers removable from the base unit instead of being wired directly into it, the controller storage was moved to the rear of the unit, and the sound was now mixed into the RF TV signal so the unit no longer needed a speaker. Electronics was also simplified with custom logic chips instead of standard logic resulting in a much smaller circuit board. This version also featured a simpler and more modern-looking case design. However, by this time the market was in the midst of the first video game crash, and Fairchild eventually threw in the towel and left the market. A number of licensed versions were released in Europe, including the '''Luxor Video Entertainment System''' in Scandinavia (Sweden), '''Adman Grandstand''' in the UK, and the '''Saba Videoplay''', '''Nordmende Teleplay''' and '''ITT Tele-Match Processor''', from Germany and also '''Dumont Videoplay''' and '''Barco Challenger''' from the Barco/Dumont company in Italy and Belgium.\n\n==See also==\n*[[TV POWWW]] (interactive TV game show that used Channel F)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=channel-f The Dot Eaters article] with a history of the Channel F and games\n* [http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/545 Interview with designer Jerry Lawson]\n* [http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/channel-f/ MobyGames list] of Channel F games\n* [http://channelf.se/ Channel F wiki] and gallery of labels, instructions, boxes\n* [http://www.google.com/patents/US4095791 Patent: Cartridge programmable video game apparatus US 4095791 A]\n* [http://www.fastcompany.com/3040889/the-untold-story-of-the-invention-of-the-game-cartridge The Untold Story of the Invention of the Video Game Cartridge] - how the Channel F's video game cartridge was created (January 22, 2015).\n* [https://aux.avclub.com/channel-f-was-1977-s-top-game-system-before-atari-wiped-1798260297 Channel F was 1977\u2019s top game system\u2014before Atari wiped it out] at [[The A.V.

Many systems of collation are based on [[number|numerical order]] or [[alphabetical order]], or extensions and combinations thereof. Collation is a fundamental element of most office [[library classification|filing systems]], [[library catalog]]s, and [[reference book]]s.\n\nCollation differs from ''[[document classification|classification]]'' in that classification is concerned with arranging information into logical categories, while collation is concerned with the ordering of items of information, usually based on the form of their [[identifier]]s. Formally speaking, a collation method typically defines a [[total order]] on a set of possible identifiers, called [[sort key]]s, which consequently produces a [[total preorder]] on the set of items of information (items with the same identifier are not placed in any defined order).\n\nA collation algorithm such as the [[Unicode collation algorithm]] defines an order through the process of comparing two given [[character string]]s and deciding which should come before the other. When an order has been defined in this way, a ''[[sorting algorithm]]'' can be used to put a list of any number of items into that order.\n\nThe main advantage of collation is that it makes it fast and easy for a user to find an element in the list, or to confirm that it is absent from the list. In automatic systems this can be done using a [[binary search algorithm]] or [[interpolation search]]; manual searching may be performed using a roughly similar procedure, though this will often be done unconsciously. Other advantages are that one can easily find the first or last elements on the list (most likely to be useful in the case of numerically sorted data), or elements in a given range (useful again in the case of numerical data, and also with alphabetically ordered data when one may be sure of only the first few letters of the sought item or items).\n\n==Numerical and chronological order==\nStrings representing [[number]]s may be sorted based on the values of the numbers that they represent. For example, \"\u22124\", \"2.5\", \"10\", \"89\", \"30,000\". Note that pure application of this method may provide only a partial ordering on the strings, since different strings can represent the same number (as with \"2\" and \"2.0\" or, when [[scientific notation]] is used, \"2e3\" and \"2000\").\n\nA similar approach may be taken with strings representing [[calendar date|dates]] or other items that can be ordered chronologically or in some other natural fashion.\n\n==Alphabetical order==\n{{Main article|Alphabetical order}}\n[[Alphabetical order]] is the basis for many systems of collation where items of information are identified by strings consisting principally of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] from an [[alphabet]]. The ordering of the strings relies on the existence of a standard ordering for the letters of the alphabet in question. (The system is not limited to alphabets in the strict technical sense; languages that use a [[syllabary]] or [[abugida]], for example [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], can use the same ordering principle provided there is a set ordering for the symbols used.)\n\nTo decide which of two strings comes first in alphabetical order, initially their first letters are compared. The string whose first letter appears earlier in the alphabet comes first in alphabetical order. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on, until the order is decided. (If one string runs out of letters to compare, then it is deemed to come first; for example, \"cart\" comes before \"carthorse\".) The result of arranging a set of strings in alphabetical order is that words with the same first letter are grouped together, and within such a group words with the same first two letters are grouped together, and so on.\n\n[[Capital letter]]s are typically treated as equivalent to their corresponding lowercase letters. (For alternative treatments in computerized systems, see [[#Automated collation|Automated collation]], below.)\n\nCertain limitations, complications, and special conventions may apply when alphabetical order is used:\n*When strings contain [[space (character)|spaces]] or other word dividers, the decision must be taken whether to ignore these dividers or to treat them as symbols preceding all other letters of the alphabet. For example, if the first approach is taken then \"car park\" will come after \"carbon\" and \"carp\" (as it would if it were written \"carpark\"), whereas in the second approach \"car park\" will come before those two words. The first rule is used in many (but not all) [[dictionary|dictionaries]], the second in [[telephone directory|telephone directories]] (so that Wilson, Jim K appears with other people named Wilson, Jim and not after Wilson, Jimbo).\n*Abbreviations may be treated as if they were spelt out in full. For example, names containing \"St.\" (short for the English word ''[[Saint]]'') are often ordered as if they were written out as \"Saint\". There is also a traditional convention in English that surnames beginning ''Mc'' and ''M''' are listed as if those prefixes were written ''Mac''.\n*Strings that represent personal names will often be listed by alphabetical order of surname, even if the [[given name]] comes first. For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O'Leary should be sorted as \"Hernandes, Juan\" and \"O'Leary, Brian\" even if they are not written this way.\n*Very common initial words, such as ''The'' in English, are often ignored for sorting purposes. So ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' would be sorted as just \"Shining\" or \"Shining, The\".\n*When some of the strings contain [[numerical digit|numerals]] (or other non-letter characters), various approaches are possible. Sometimes such characters are treated as if they came before or after all the letters of the alphabet. Another method is for numbers to be sorted alphabetically as they would be spelled: for example ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]'' would be sorted as if spelled out \"seventeen seventy-six\", and ''[[24 heures du Mans]]'' as if spelled \"vingt-quatre...\" (French for \"twenty-four\"). When numerals or other symbols are used as special graphical forms of letters, as in ''1337'' for [[leet]] or ''Se7en'' for the movie title ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', they may be sorted as if they were those letters.\n*Languages have different conventions for treating [[modified letter]]s and certain letter combinations. For example, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the letter ''\u00f1'' is treated as a basic letter following ''n'', and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''ch'' and ''ll'' were formerly (until 1994) treated as basic letters following ''c'' and ''l'', although they are now alphabetized as two-letter combinations. A list of such conventions for various languages can be found at {{slink|Alphabetical order|Language-specific conventions}}.\n\nIn several languages the rules have changed over time, and so older dictionaries may use a different order than modern ones. Furthermore, collation may depend on use. For example, German [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[telephone directory|telephone directories]] use different approaches.\n\n==Radical-and-stroke sorting==\n:''See also [[Chinese characters#Indexing|Indexing of Chinese characters]]''\nAnother form of collation is '''radical-and-stroke sorting''', used for non-alphabetic writing systems such as the [[hanzi]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and the [[kanji]] of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by convention. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] in Chinese and logographic systems derived from Chinese. Characters are then grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation. For example, the Chinese character \u5988 (meaning \"mother\") is sorted as a six-stroke character under the three-stroke primary radical \u5973.\n\nThe radical-and-stroke system is cumbersome compared to an alphabetical system in which there are a few characters, all unambiguous. The choice of which components of a logograph comprise separate radicals and which radical is primary is not clear-cut. As a result, logographic languages often supplement radical-and-stroke ordering with alphabetic sorting of a phonetic conversion of the logographs. For example, the kanji word ''[[Tokyo|T\u014dky\u014d]]'' (\u6771\u4eac) can be sorted as if it were spelled out in the Japanese characters of the [[hiragana]] syllabary as \"to-u-ki-<sub>yo</sub>-u\" (\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046), using the conventional sorting order for these characters.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn addition, in Greater China, [[surname stroke order]]ing is a convention in some official documents where people's names are listed without hierarchy.\n\nThe radical-and-stroke system, or some similar pattern-matching and stroke-counting method, was traditionally the only practical method for constructing dictionaries that someone could use to look up a logograph whose pronunciation was unknown. With the advent of computers, dictionary programs are now available that allow one to handwrite a character using a mouse or stylus.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Automated collation==\nWhen information is stored in digital systems, collation may become an automated process. It is then necessary to implement an appropriate collation [[algorithm]] that allows the information to be sorted in a satisfactory manner for the application in question. Often the aim will be to achieve an alphabetical or numerical ordering that follows the standard criteria as described in the preceding sections. However, not all of these criteria are easy to automate.<ref name=\"Walters\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pd_iFM4eLsC&pg=PA278&dq=%22collation+algorithms%22&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=2k-yT_GVEIrP4QSSx428CQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22collation%20algorithms%22&f=false ''M Programming: A Comprehensive Guide''], Richard F. Walters, Digital Press, 1997</ref>\n\nThe simplest kind of automated collation is based on the numerical codes of the symbols in a [[character set]], such as [[ASCII]] coding (or any of its [[superset]]s such as [[Unicode]]), with the symbols being ordered in increasing numerical order of their codes, and this ordering being extended to strings in accordance with the basic principles of alphabetical ordering (mathematically speaking, [[lexicographical order]]ing). So a computer program might treat the characters ''a'', ''b'', ''C'', ''d'', and ''$'' as being ordered ''$'', ''C'', ''a'', ''b'', ''d'' (the corresponding ASCII codes are ''$'' = 36, ''a'' = 97, ''b'' = 98, ''C'' = 67, and ''d'' = 100). Therefore, strings beginning with ''C'', ''M'', or ''Z'' would be sorted before strings with lower-case ''a'', ''b'', etc. This is sometimes called ''[[ASCIIbetical order]]''. This deviates from the standard alphabetical order, particularly due to the ordering of capital letters before all lower-case ones (and possibly the treatment of spaces and other non-letter characters). It is therefore often applied with certain alterations, the most obvious being case conversion (often to uppercase, for historical reasons<ref group=\"note\">Historically, computers only handled text in uppercase (this dates back to [[telegraph]] conventions).</ref>) before comparison of ASCII values.\n\nIn many collation algorithms, the comparison is based not on the numerical codes of the characters, but with reference to the '''collating sequence''' \u2013 a sequence in which the characters are assumed to come for the purpose of collation \u2013 as well as other ordering rules appropriate to the given application. This can serve to apply the correct conventions used for alphabetical ordering in the language in question, dealing properly with differently cased letters, [[modified letter]]s, [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], particular abbreviations, and so on, as mentioned above under [[#Alphabetical order|Alphabetical order]], and in detail in the [[Alphabetical order]] article. Such algorithms are potentially quite complex, possibly requiring several passes through the text.<ref name=\"Walters\"/>\n\nProblems are nonetheless still common when the algorithm has to encompass more than one language. For example, in [[German (language)|German]] dictionaries the word ''\u00f6konomisch'' comes between ''offenbar'' and ''olfaktorisch'', while [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]] dictionaries treat ''o'' and ''\u00f6'' as different letters, placing ''oyun'' before ''\u00f6b\u00fcr''.\n\nA standard algorithm for collating any collection of strings composed of any standard [[Unicode]] symbols is the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]]. This can be adapted to use the appropriate collation sequence for a given language by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in [[Common Locale Data Repository]].\n\n===Sort keys===\n{{redirect|Sort key|sort keys in Wikipedia|WP:SORTKEY}}\nIn some applications, the strings by which items are collated may differ from the identifiers that are displayed. For example, ''The Shining'' might be sorted as ''Shining, The'' (see [[#Alphabetical order|Alphabetical order]] above), but it may still be desired to display it as ''The Shining''. In this case two sets of strings can be stored, one for display purposes, and another for collation purposes. Strings used for collation in this way are called ''sort keys''.\n\n===Issues with numbers===\nSometimes, it is desired to order text with embedded numbers using proper numerical order. For example, \"Figure 7b\" goes before \"Figure 11a\", even though '7' comes after '1' in [[Unicode]]. This can be extended to [[Roman numeral]]s. This behavior is not particularly difficult to produce as long as only integers are to be sorted, although it can slow down sorting significantly. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] does this when sorting [[file name]]s.\n\nSorting decimals properly is a bit more difficult, because different locales use different symbols for a [[decimal separator|decimal point]], and sometimes the same character used as a [[Decimal mark|decimal point]] is also used as a separator, for example \"Section 3.2.5\". There is no universal answer for how to sort such strings; any rules are application dependent.\n\nAscending order of numbers differs from alphabetical order, e.g. 11 comes alphabetically before 2. This can be fixed with [[leading zero]]s: 02 comes alphabetically before 11. See e.g. [[ISO 8601]].\n\nAlso \u221213 comes alphabetically after \u221212 although it is less. With negative numbers, to make ascending order correspond with alphabetical sorting, more drastic measures are needed such as adding a constant to all numbers to make them all positive.\n\n==Labeling of ordered items==\nIn some contexts, numbers and letters are used not so much as a basis for establishing an ordering, but as a means of labeling items that are already ordered. For example, pages, sections, chapters, and the like, as well as the items of lists, are frequently \"numbered\" in this way. Labeling series that may be used include ordinary [[Arabic numerals]] (1, 2, 3, ...), [[Roman numerals]] (I, II, III, ... or i, ii, iii, ...), or letters (A, B, C, ... or a, b, c, ...). (An alternative method for indicating list items, without numbering them, is to use a [[bulleted list]].)\n\nWhen letters of an alphabet are used for this purpose of [[enumeration]], there are certain language-specific conventions as to which letters are used. For example, the [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] letters [[\u042a]] and [[\u042c]] (which in writing are only used for modifying the preceding [[consonant]]), and usually also [[\u042b]], [[\u0419]], and [[\u0401]], are usually omitted. Also in many languages that use extended [[Latin script]], the [[modified letter]]s are often not used in enumeration.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alphabetical order]]\n* [[ASCII#Order|Asciibetical order]]\n* [[Sorting]]\n* [[Taxonomic sequence]]\n* [[Mac and Mc together]]\n* [[Unicode equivalence]]\n* [[Natural sort order]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|collation|alphabetization}}\n*[https://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/ Unicode Collation Algorithm]: Unicode Technical Standard #10\n*[http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa092099.htm#letters Collation in Spanish]\n*[https://www.un.org/Overview/unmember.html Collation of the names of the member states of the United Nations]\n*[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists Typographical collation for many languages], as proposed in the List module of [[Cascading Style Sheet]]s.\n*[http://www.collation-charts.org/ Collation Charts]: Charts demonstrating language-specific sorting orders in various operating systems and DBMS\n*[http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/locexp?_=en_US&x=col ICU Locale Explorer]: An online demonstration of sorting in different languages that uses the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]] with [[International Components for Unicode]]\n\n[[Category:Collation| ]]", "sha1": "lts3uw8japrywzwbkppjriamntou2ov"}}, {"title": "Civil Rights Act", "ns": "0", "id": "7490", "revision": {"id": "848554887", "parentid": "847299316", "timestamp": "2018-07-02T17:47:21Z", "contributor": {"username": "RAN1", "id": "11227903"}, "comment": "Rv previous edit", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Civil Rights Act''' may refer to several [[acts of the United States Congress]], including:\n\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], extending the rights of emancipated slaves by stating that any person born in the United States regardless of race is a US citizen\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], prohibiting ethnic violence against African Americans (see also, [[Enforcement Acts]], three Acts in 1870-1871)\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], prohibiting discrimination in \"public accommodations\"; found unconstitutional in 1883 as Congress could not regulate conduct of individuals\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]], establishing the Civil Rights Commission\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1960]], establishing federal inspection of local voter registration polls\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin by federal and state governments as well as some public places\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], prohibiting discrimination in sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, creed, and national origin\n* [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], providing the right to trial by jury on discrimination claims and introducing the possibility of emotional distress damages, while limiting the amount that a jury could award\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987]], specifying that recipients of federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas, not just in the particular program or activity that received federal funding\n* [[List of short titles]]\n* [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], a 1959 Californian law prohibiting discrimination in housing\n* [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]\n\n{{Set index article}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of legislation by short title and collective title]]", "sha1": "ah0ri5t21q9o2m23k7hthvktsv87j8x"}}, {"title": "Cola", "ns": "0", "id": "7491", "revision": {"id": "864515314", "parentid": "864514933", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T18:42:03Z", "contributor": {"ip": "190.102.130.163"}, "comment": "/* South America */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|A sweetened,carbonated soft drink}}\n{{About|the beverage}}\n{{Infobox beverage\n| name         = Cola\n| image        = [[File:Tumbler of cola with ice.jpg|220px]]\n| caption      = A glass of cola served with [[ice cube]]s\n| type         = [[Soft drink]]\n| abv          = \n| proof        = \n| manufacturer =Various \n| distributor  = \n| origin       =United States\n| introduced   = 1886\n| discontinued = \n| color        = [[Caramel color|Caramel]]\n| flavor       = Cola (kola nut, citrus, cinnamon and vanilla)\n| variants     = \n| related      = \n| website      =\n}}\n\n'''Cola''' is a sweetened, [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]] flavored with [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], [[citrus]] [[essential oil|oils]] and other flavorings.

Organizations began to adopt computerized information systems, and the demand for [[software development]] grew significantly. Many processes for software development were in their infancy, with few standard or \"best practice\" approaches defined.\n\nAs a result, the growth was accompanied by growing pains: project failure was common, the field of [[computer science]] was still in its early years, and the ambitions for project scale and complexity exceeded the market capability to deliver adequate products within a planned budget.

At the request of the U.S. Air Force he began formalizing his Process Maturity Framework to aid the U.S. Department of Defense in evaluating the capability of software contractors as part of awarding contracts.\n\nThe result of the Air Force study was a model for the military to use as an objective evaluation of software subcontractors' process capability maturity. Humphrey based this framework on the earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed by [[Philip B. Crosby]] in his book \"Quality is Free\".<ref name=crosby79qif>{{cite book\n |last1=Crosby |first1=P. B. |authorlink1=Philip B.

Humphrey based his approach on the staged evolution of a system of software development practices within an organization, rather than measuring the maturity of each separate development process independently. The CMM has thus been used by different organizations as a general and powerful tool for understanding and then improving general business process performance.\n\nWatts Humphrey's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was published in 1988<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = W.

Applying multiple models that are not integrated within and across an organization could be costly in training, appraisals, and improvement activities. The [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI) project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple models for software development processes, thus the CMMI model has superseded the CMM model, though the CMM model continues to be a general theoretical process capability model used in the public domain.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=NJ0Apk1iNDAC&pg=PA486&lpg=PA486&dq=The+Capability+Maturity+Model+Integration+(CMMI)+project+was+formed+to+sort+out+the+problem+of+using+multiple+models+for+software+development+processes,+thus+the+CMMI+model+has+superseded+the+CMM+model,+though+the+CMM+model+continues+to+be+a+general+theoretical+process+capability+model+used+in+the+public+domain&source=bl&ots=6076bxZHBX&sig=bj09TYICpjpHtchK8p6XNIirwEk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgw4eM4MfZAhXGKo8KHZ9LA44Q6AEIWDAF#v=onepage&q=The%20Capability%20Maturity%20Model%20Integration%20(CMMI)%20project%20was%20formed%20to%20sort%20out%20the%20problem%20of%20using%20multiple%20models%20for%20software%20development%20processes,%20thus%20the%20CMMI%20model%20has%20superseded%20the%20CMM%20model,%20though%20the%20CMM%20model%20continues%20to%20be%20a%20general%20theoretical%20process%20capability%20model%20used%20in%20the%20public%20domain&f=false|title=Juran'S Quality Hb 6E|last=Juran|date=2010-08-26|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Limited|isbn=9780071070898|language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Transformations in Engineering Education|last=Natarajan|first=R|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Adapted to other processes===\nThe CMM was originally intended as a tool to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a contracted software project. Though it comes from the area of software development, it can be, has been, and continues to be widely applied as a general model of the maturity of ''process'' (e.g., [[IT service management]] processes) in IS/IT (and other) organizations.\n\n==Model topics==\n\n===Maturity models===\nA [[maturity model]] can be viewed as a set of structured levels that describe how well the behaviors, practices and processes of an organization can reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes.\n\nA maturity model can be used as a benchmark for comparison and as an aid to understanding - for example, for comparative assessment of different organizations where there is something in common that can be used as a basis for comparison. In the case of the CMM, for example, the basis for comparison would be the organizations' software development processes.\n\n===Structure===\nThe model involves five aspects:\n* ''Maturity Levels:'' a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes would be systematically managed by a combination of process optimization and continuous process improvement.\n* ''Key Process Areas:'' a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of goals considered important.\n* ''Goals:'' the goals of a key process area summarize the states that must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope, boundaries, and intent of each key process area.\n* ''Common Features:'' common features include practices that implement and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform, activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying implementation.\n* ''Key Practices:'' The key practices describe the elements of infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the implementation and institutionalization of the area.\n\n===Levels===\nThere are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and, according to the SEI: \"Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief\".<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CMM_39213_7.pdf State of Michigan SDLC Appendix on CMM] Attests to 2001 use of the text so it couldn't have come from here.</ref>\n# ''Initial'' (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.\n# ''Repeatable'' - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that repeating the same steps may be attempted.\n# ''Defined'' - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard [[business process]]\n# ''Capable'' - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with agreed-upon metrics.\n# ''Efficient'' - process management includes deliberate process optimization/improvement.\n\nWithin each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which characterise that level, and for each such area there are five factors:  goals,  commitment,  ability,  measurement,  and verification. These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing \u2014 as they do \u2014 the stages that organizations must go through on the way to becoming mature.\n\nThe model provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next. Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.\n\n; Level 1 - ''Initial'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically) undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ''ad hoc'', uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes. (Example - a surgeon performing a new operation a small number of times - the levels of negative outcome are not known).\n\n; Level 2 - ''Repeatable'': It is characteristic of this level of maturity that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous, but where it exists it may help to ensure that existing processes are maintained during times of stress.\n\n; Level 3 - ''Defined'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place. The processes may not have been systematically or repeatedly used - sufficient for the users to become competent or the process to be validated in a range of situations.  This could be considered a developmental stage - with use in a wider range of conditions and user competence development the process can develop to next level of maturity.\n\n; Level 4 - ''Managed (Capable)'': It is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics, effective achievement of the process objectives can be evidenced across a range of operational conditions. The suitability of the process in multiple environments has been tested and the process refined and adapted.  Process users have experienced the process in multiple and varied conditions, and are able to demonstrate competence.  The process maturity enables adaptions to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. (Example - surgeon performing an operation hundreds of times with levels of negative outcome approaching zero).\n\n; Level 5 - ''Optimizing (Efficient)'': It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements.\n\nAt maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing statistical ''common causes'' of process variation and changing the process (for example, to shift the mean of the process performance) to improve process performance. This would be done at the same time as maintaining the likelihood of achieving the established quantitative process-improvement objectives. There are only a few companies in the world that have attained this level 5.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.\n\n===Critique===\nThe model was originally intended to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a software project. It has been used for and may be suited to that purpose, but critics {{who|date=January 2017}} pointed out that process maturity according to the CMM was not necessarily mandatory for successful software development.\n\n===Software process framework===\nThe software process framework documented is intended to guide those wishing to assess an organization's or project's consistency with the Key Process Areas. For each maturity level there are five checklist types:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

RDX was crucial to the war effort and the current batch-production process was too slow. In February 1942, TEC began producing small amounts of RDX at its Wexler Bend pilot plant, which led to the U.S. government authorizing TEC to design and build [[Holston Ordnance Works]] (H.O.W.) in June 1942. By April 1943, RDX was being manufactured there.<ref name=Bachmann-Sheehan/> At the end of 1944, the Holston plant and the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]], which used the Woolwich process, were producing {{convert|25000|ST|tonne}} (50 million pounds) of [[Composition B]] per month.<ref>{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=32}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Bachmann process for RDX was found to be richer in [[HMX]] than the United Kingdom's RDX.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}} This later led to a RDX plant using the Bachmann process being set up at ROF Bridgwater in 1955 to produce both RDX and HMX.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}\n\n===Military compositions===\nThe United Kingdom's intention in World War II was to use \"desensitised\" RDX. In the original Woolwich process, RDX was [[phlegmatized]] with beeswax, but later [[paraffin wax]] was used, based on the work carried out at Bruceton. In the event the UK was unable to obtain sufficient RDX to meet its needs, some of the shortfall was met by substituting [[amatol]], a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT.<ref name=hornby/>\n\n[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] was reputed to have claimed that \"an aircraft can no more kill a U-boat than a crow can kill a [[Mole (animal)|mole]]\".<ref name=Baxter-42>{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|page=42}}</ref> Nonetheless, by May 1942 [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]] began to deploy [[depth charge]]s containing [[Torpex]], a mixture of RDX, TNT, and aluminium, which had up to 50 percent more destructive power than TNT-filled depth charges.<ref name=Baxter-42/> Considerable quantities of the RDX\u2013TNT mixture were produced at the Holston Ordnance Works, with [[Tennessee Eastman]] developing an automated mixing and cooling process based around the use of stainless steel [[conveyor belt]]s.<ref name=\"baxter-257&259\">{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=257 & 259}}</ref>\n\n===Terrorism===\nA [[semtex]] bomb was used in the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (known also as the Lockerbie) bombing in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bolz|first1=F.

The Torah (lit. \"teaching\"), both [[Torah|written]] and [[Oral Torah|oral]], tell the story of this covenant, and provides Jews with the terms of the covenant. The Oral Torah is the primary guide for Jews to abide by these terms, as expressed in tractate Gittin 60b, \"the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not make His covenant with [[Israel]] except by virtue of the Oral Law\"<ref>Chief Rabbi of the Commonwealth, Dr. [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] in the Forward to, Schimmel, H.

Cohen, Paul Mendes-Flohr, ''20th Century Jewish Religious Thought: Original Essays on Critical Concepts'', Jewish Publication Society, 2009, p. 394</ref> and sanctifies God in itself. This continuous maintenance of relationship between the individual Jew and God through either study, or [[Jewish prayer|prayer]] repeated three times daily, is the confirmation of the original covenant. This allows the Jewish people as a community to strive and fulfill the prophecy \"I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you. And I will establish you as a covenant of the people, for a light unto the nations.\" ({{bibleverse||Isa|42:6|HE}}) (i.e., a [[role model]]) over the course of history, and a part of the divine intent of bringing about an [[Kingdom of God#Judaism|age of peace and sanctity]] where ideally a faithful life and good deeds should be ends in themselves, not means.

Collectively, these are known as the [[Tanakh]]. According to [[Rabbinic Judaism]] the Torah was revealed by God to Moses; within it, Jews find [[613 Mitzvot]] (commandments).\n\nRabbinic tradition asserts that God revealed two Torahs to Moses, one that was written down, and one that was transmitted orally. Whereas the written Torah has a fixed form, the [[Oral Torah]] is a living tradition that includes not only specific supplements to the written Torah (for instance, what is the proper manner of ''[[shechita]]'' and what is meant by \"Frontlets\" in the [[Shema]]), but also procedures for understanding and talking about the written Torah (thus, the Oral Torah revealed at Sinai includes debates among rabbis who lived long after Moses). The Oral Law elaborations of narratives in the Bible and stories about the rabbis are referred to as ''[[aggadah]]''. It also includes elaboration of the 613 commandments in the form of laws referred to as ''[[halakha]]''. Elements of the Oral Torah were committed to writing and edited by [[Judah HaNasi]] in the [[Mishnah]] in 200 CE; much more of the Oral Torah were committed to writing in the [[Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian]] and [[Jerusalem Talmud]]s, which were edited around 600 CE and 450 CE, respectively. The Talmuds are notable for the way they combine law and lore, for their explication of the [[midrash]]ic method of interpreting tests, and for their accounts of debates among rabbis, which preserve divergent and conflicting interpretations of the Bible and legal rulings.\n\nSince the transcription of the Talmud, notable rabbis have compiled law codes that are generally held in high regard: the [[Mishneh Torah]], the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]], and the [[Shulchan Aruch]]. The latter, which was based on earlier codes and supplemented by the commentary by [[Moshe Isserles]] that notes other practices and customs practiced by Jews in different communities, especially among Ashkenazim, is generally held to be authoritative by Orthodox Jews. The [[Zohar]], which was written in the 13th century, is generally held as the most important esoteric treatise of the Jews.\n\nAll contemporary Jewish movements consider the Tanakh, and the Oral Torah in the form of the Mishnah and Talmuds as sacred, although movements are divided as to claims concerning their divine revelation, and also their authority. For Jews, the Torah\u2014written and oral\u2014is the primary guide to the relationship between God and man, a living document that has unfolded and will continue to unfold whole new insights over the generations and millennia. A saying that captures this goes, \"Turn it [the Torah's words] over and over again, for everything is in it.\"\n\nChristians accept the Written Torah and other books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (alternatively called [[Old Testament]]) as [[Scripture]], although they generally give readings from the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] translation instead of the [[Biblical Hebrew]]/[[Biblical Aramaic]] [[Masoretic Text]]. Two notable examples are:\n* [[Isaiah 7:14]] \u2013 \"virgin\" instead of \"young woman\"\n* [[They have pierced my hands and my feet|Psalm 22:16]] \u2013 \"they have pierced my hands and feet\" instead of \"like a lion, (they are at) my hands and feet\"\n\nInstead of the traditional Jewish order and names for the books, Christians organize and name the books closer to that found in the Septuagint. Some Christian denominations (such as Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox), include a number of books that are not in the Hebrew Bible (the [[biblical apocrypha]] or [[deuterocanonical books]] or [[Anagignoskomena]], see [[Development of the Old Testament canon]]) in their [[biblical canon]] that are not in today's Jewish canon, although they were included in the Septuagint. Christians reject the Jewish Oral Torah, which was still in oral, and therefore unwritten, form in the time of Jesus.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&letter=J&search=Jesus Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus] notes: \"Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the [[Halakah]] was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the [[Hillel the Elder|Bet Hillel]] and [[Shammai|Bet Shammai]] were occurring about the time of his maturity.\"</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Jesus depicted delivering the [[Sermon on the Mount]] which included [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|commentary on the Old Covenant]]. Some scholars consider this to be an [[Typology (theology)|antitype]] of the proclamation of the [[Ten Commandments]] or [[Mosaic Covenant]] by [[Moses]] from the [[Biblical Mount Sinai]].<ref name=\"ODCC self\">\"Sermon on the Mount.\" Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>]]\n\n==Covenant theology==\nChristians believe that God has established a New Covenant with people through Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles, and other books collectively called the New Testament (the word ''testament'' attributed to [[Tertullian]] is commonly interchanged with the word ''covenant'').<ref>Sometimes the ''New Covenant'' is referred to as the [New Testament, on the basis of passages such as {{bibleverse||Heb|9:16|KJV}}, in its traditional ([[KJV]]) translation. This usage reflects the [[Vulgate]], in which the word \"covenant\" was translated ''testamentum''. Biblical scholars, such as [[O. Palmer Robertson]], have argued against this translation, however, since the word ''testamentum'', in [[Latin]], expresses the concept of a \"last will\", not an agreement between two parties sealed with a self-maledictory oath. See also [http://www.theopedia.com/Covenant Theopedia: \"Covenant\"] and [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=837&letter=C&search=Mosaic%20Covenant#2888 Jewish Encyclopedia: \"Covenant: The Old and the New Covenant\"].</ref> For some Christians, such as [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], this New Covenant includes authoritative [[sacred tradition]]s and [[canon law]]. Others, especially [[Protestantism|Protestants]], reject the authority of such traditions and instead hold to the principle of ''[[sola scriptura]]'', which accepts only the Bible itself as the final rule of faith and practice. Anglicans do not believe in ''sola scriptura''. For them scripture is the longest leg of a 3-legged stool: scripture, tradition and reason. Scripture cannot stand on its own since it must be interpreted in the light of the Church's patristic teaching and ecumenical creeds. Additionally, some denominations include the \"oral teachings of Jesus to the Apostles\", which they believe have been handed down to this day by [[apostolic succession]].\n\nChristians refer to the biblical books about Jesus as the New Testament, and to the canon of Hebrew books as the [[Old Testament]]. Judaism does not accept the [[wikt:retronym|retronymic]] labeling of its [[scripture|sacred texts]] as the \"Old Testament\", and some Jews refer to the New Testament as the Christian Testament or Christian Bible. Judaism rejects all claims that the Christian New Covenant [[supersessionism|supersedes]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogates]], fulfills, or is the unfolding or consummation of the covenant expressed in the Written and Oral Torahs. Therefore, just as Christianity does not accept that Mosaic law has any authority over Christians, Judaism does not accept that the New Testament has any religious authority over Jews.\n\n==Law==\n{{See also|Antinomianism|Biblical law in Christianity|Christian anarchism}}\nMany Jews view Christians as having quite an ambivalent view of the Torah, or Mosaic law: on one hand Christians speak of it as God's absolute word, but on the other, they apply its commandments with a certain selectivity. Some Jews contend that Christians cite commandments from the Old Testament to support one point of view but then ignore other commandments of a similar class and of equal weight. Examples of this are certain commandments that God states explicitly be a \"lasting covenant\" ([[NIV]] {{bibleverse||Exod|31:16-17|niv}}). Some translate the Hebrew as a \"perpetual covenant\" ({{bibleverse||Exod|31:16\u201317|he}}). Likewise, some Christians contend that Jews cite some commandments from the Torah to support one view, but then ignore other commandments of a similar class and of equal weight.\n\nChristians explain that such selectivity is based on rulings made by early Jewish Christians in the [[Book of Acts]], at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], that, while believing gentiles did not need to fully convert to Judaism, they should follow some aspects of Torah like avoiding [[idolatry]] and [[fornication]] and [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|15:28\u201329}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:25}}</ref> including, according to some interpretations, [[Homosexuality and Christianity|homosexuality]]. This view is also reflected by modern Judaism, in that [[Ger toshav|Righteous gentiles]] needn't convert to Judaism and need to observe only the Noahide Laws, which also contain prohibitions against idolatry and fornication and blood.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah] states: \"[[Jacob Emden|R. Emden]] (), in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to \"Seder 'Olam\" (pp. 32b\u201334b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the gentiles to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven moral laws of Noah]] and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law\u2014which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].</ref>\n\nSome Christians agree that Jews who accept Jesus should still observe all of Torah, see for example [[Dual-covenant theology]], based on warnings by Jesus to Jews not to use him as an excuse to disregard it,<ref>{{bibleverse||Matt|5:19}}</ref> and they support efforts of those such as Messianic Jews ([[Messianic Judaism]] is considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity<ref name=\"Denominations\">\n;[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]\n:{{cite web\n| url = http://www.aish.com/jw/s/48892792.html\n| title = Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus\n| accessdate = July 28, 2010\n| last = Simmons\n| first = Shraga\n| publisher = [[Aish HaTorah]]\n| quote = Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:<br /> #Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies. #Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah. #Biblical verses \"referring\" to Jesus are mistranslations. #Jewish belief is based on national revelation.\n}}\n;[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]:{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html\n| title = Messianic Jews Are Not Jews\n| accessdate = 2007-02-14\n| last = Waxman\n| first = Jonathan\n| year = 2006\n| publisher = [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]\n| quote = Hebrew Christian, Jewish Christian, Jew for Jesus, Messianic Jew, Fulfilled Jew.

Judaism and major sects of Christianity reject the view that God is entirely [[Immanence|immanent]] (although some see this as the concept of the Holy Ghost) and within the world as a physical presence, (although trinitarian Christians believe in the [[incarnation]] of God). Both religions reject the view that God is entirely [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and thus separate from the world, as the pre-Christian Greek [[Unknown God]]. Both religions reject [[atheism]] on one hand and [[polytheism]] on the other.\n\nBoth religions agree that God shares both transcendent and immanent qualities. How these religions resolve this issue is where the religions differ. Christianity posits that God exists as a [[Trinity]]; in this view God exists as three distinct persons who share a single divine [[Ousia|essence]], or [[Consubstantiality|substance]]. In those three there is one, and in that one there are three; the one God is indivisible, while the three persons are distinct and unconfused, [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. It teaches that God became especially immanent in physical form through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of God the Son who was born as [[Jesus of Nazareth]], who is believed to be at once [[Hypostatic union|fully God and fully human]]. There are denominations self-describing as Christian who question one or more of these doctrines, however, see [[Nontrinitarianism]]. By contrast, Judaism sees God as a [[Divine simplicity|single entity]], and views trinitarianism as both incomprehensible and a violation of the Bible's teaching that God is one. It rejects the notion that Jesus or any other object or living being could be 'God', that God could have a literal 'son' in physical form or is divisible in any way, or that God could be made to be joined to the [[Nature|material world]] in such fashion. Although Judaism provides Jews with a word to label God's transcendence (''[[Ein Sof]]'', without end) and immanence (''[[Shekhinah]]'', in-dwelling), these are merely human words to describe two ways of experiencing God; God is one and indivisible.\n\n===Shituf===\n{{Main|Shituf}}\nA minority Jewish view, which appears in some codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]], is that while Christian worship is polytheistic (due to the multiplicity of the Trinity), it is permissible for them to swear in God's name, since they are referring to the one God. This theology is referred to in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as [[Shituf]] (literally \"partnership\" or \"association\"). Although worship of a trinity is considered to be not different from any other form of idolatry for Jews, it may be an acceptable belief for non-Jews (according to the ruling of some Rabbinic authorities).\n\n==Right action==\n\n===Faith versus good deeds===\n{{See also|Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification|Biblical law in Christianity}}\nJudaism teaches that the purpose of the Torah is to teach us how to act correctly. God's existence is a given in Judaism, and not something that most authorities see as a matter of required belief. Although some authorities see the Torah as commanding Jews to believe in God, Jews see belief in God as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a Jewish life. The quintessential verbal expression of Judaism is the [[Shema Yisrael]], the statement that the God of the Bible is their God, and that this God is unique and one. The quintessential physical expression of Judaism is behaving in accordance with the 613 Mitzvot (the commandments specified in the Torah), and thus live one's life in God's ways.\n\nThus fundamentally in Judaism, one is enjoined to bring holiness into life (with the guidance of God's laws), rather than removing oneself from life to be holy.\n\nMuch of Christianity also teaches that God wants people to perform [[good works]], but all branches hold that good works alone will not lead to salvation, which is called [[Legalism (theology)|Legalism]], the exception being [[dual-covenant theology]]. Some Christian denominations hold that salvation depends upon transformational faith in Jesus, which expresses itself in good works as a testament (or witness) to ones faith for others to see (primarily Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism), while others (including most Protestants) hold that [[Sola fide|faith alone]] is necessary for salvation. Some argue that the difference is not as great as it seems, because it really hinges on the [[Faith in Christianity|definition of \"faith\" used]]. The first group generally uses the term \"faith\" to mean \"intellectual and heartfelt assent and submission\". Such a faith will not be salvific until a person has allowed it to effect a life transforming conversion (turning towards God) in their being (see [[Ontotheology]]). The Christians that hold to \"salvation by faith alone\" (also called by its Latin name \"[[sola fide]]\") define faith as being implicitly [[ontological]]\u2014mere intellectual assent is not termed \"faith\" by these groups. Faith, then, is life-transforming by definition.\n\n===Sin===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\n{{Main|Jewish views of sin|Christian views on sin}}\nIn both religions, offenses against the will of God are called [[sin]]. These sins can be thoughts, words, or deeds.\n\nCatholicism categorizes sins into various groups. A wounding of the relationship with God is often called [[venial sin]]; a complete rupture of the relationship with God is often called [[mortal sin]]. Without salvation from sin (see below), a person's separation from God is permanent, causing such a person to enter [[Hell]] in the [[afterlife]]. Both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church define sin more or less as a \"macula\", a spiritual stain or uncleanliness that constitutes damage to man's image and likeness of God.\n\nHebrew has several words for sin, each with its own specific meaning. The word ''pesha'', or \"trespass\", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word ''aveira'' means \"transgression\". And the word ''avone'', or \"iniquity\", means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as \"sin\", ''het'', literally means \"to go astray\". Just as Jewish law, ''halakha'' provides the proper \"way\" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path. Judaism teaches that humans are born with [[free will]], and morally neutral, with both a ''[[yetzer hatov]]'', (literally, \"the good inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a ''[[yetzer hara]]'', (literally \"the evil inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible\u2014only at times more difficult. There is almost always a \"way back\" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)\n\nThe rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''yetzer hara'': one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was \"very good\" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as \"good\") and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.\n\nIn contrast to the Jewish view of being morally balanced, [[Original Sin]] refers to the idea that the sin of [[Adam and Eve]]'s disobedience (sin \"at the origin\") has passed on a spiritual heritage, so to speak. Christians teach that human beings inherit a corrupted or damaged human nature in which the tendency to do bad is greater than it would have been otherwise, so much so that human nature would not be capable now of participating in the afterlife with God. This is not a matter of being \"guilty\" of anything; each person is only personally guilty of their own actual sins. However, this understanding of original sin is what lies behind the Christian emphasis on the need for spiritual salvation from a spiritual Saviour, who can forgive and set aside sin even though humans are not inherently pure and worthy of such salvation. Paul the Apostle in Romans and I Corinthians placed special emphasis on this doctrine, and stressed that belief in Jesus would allow Christians to overcome death and attain salvation in the hereafter.\n\nRoman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and some Protestants teach the Sacrament of [[Baptism]] is the means by which each person's damaged human nature is healed and [[Sanctifying Grace]] (capacity to enjoy and participate in the spiritual life of God) is restored. This is referred to as \"being born of water and the Spirit\", following the terminology in the Gospel of St. John. Most Protestants believe this salvific grace comes about at the moment of personal decision to follow Jesus, and that baptism is a symbol of the grace already received.\n\n===Love===\n{{Main|Jewish theology of love|Great Commandment|Agape}}\nThe Hebrew word for \"love\", ''ahavah'' (\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4), is used to describe intimate or romantic feelings or relationships, such as the love between parent and child in Genesis 22:2; 25: 28; 37:3; the love between close friends in I Samuel 18:2, 20:17; or the love between a young man and young woman in [[Song of Songs]]. Christians will often use the Greek of the Septuagint to make distinctions between the types of love: ''[[philia]]'' for brotherly, ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' for romantic and ''[[agape]]'' for self-sacrificing love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/~jks4/city/Oord~Defining+Love.pdf|title=James K.A. Smith|website=Calvin College}}</ref>\n\nLike many Jewish scholars and theologians, literary critic Harold Bloom understands Judaism as fundamentally a religion of love. But he argues that one can understand the Hebrew conception of love only by looking at one of the core commandments of Judaism, Leviticus 19:18, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\", also called the second [[Great Commandment]]. Talmudic sages Hillel and [[Rabbi Akiva]] commented that this is a major element of the Jewish religion. Also, this commandment is arguably at the center of the Jewish faith. As the third book of the Torah, Leviticus is literally the central book. Historically, Jews have considered it of central importance: traditionally, children began their study of the Torah with Leviticus, and the midrashic literature on Leviticus is among the longest and most detailed of midrashic literature (see Bamberger 1981: 737). Bernard Bamberger considers Leviticus 19, beginning with God's commandment in verse 3\u2014\"You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God, am holy\"\u2014to be \"the climactic chapter of the book, the one most often read and quoted\" (1981:889). Leviticus 19:18 is itself the climax of this chapter.\n\n===Abortion===\n{{Main|Judaism and abortion|Christianity and abortion}}\nThe only statements in the Tanakh about the status of a fetus state that killing an unborn infant does not have the same status as killing a born human being, and mandates a much lesser penalty (Exodus 21: 22\u201325)<ref>Daniel Schiff, 2002,''Abortion in Judaism''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 9\u201311</ref> (although this interpretation is disputed, the passage could refer to an injury to a woman that causes a premature, live birth).\n\nThe Talmud states that the fetus is not yet a full human being until it has been born (either the head or the body is mostly outside of the woman), therefore killing a fetus is not murder, and [[abortion]]\u2014in restricted circumstances\u2014has always been legal under Jewish law. [[Rashi]], the great 12th century commentator on the Bible and Talmud, states clearly of the fetus ''lav nefesh hu'': \"it is not a person.\" The Talmud contains the expression ''ubar yerech imo''\u2014the fetus is as the thigh of its mother,' i.e., the fetus is deemed to be part and parcel of the pregnant woman's body.\" The Babylonian Talmud [[Yevamot]] 69b states that: \"the embryo is considered to be mere water until the fortieth day.\" Afterwards, it is considered subhuman until it is born. Christians who agree with these views may refer to this idea as abortion before the [[quickening]] of the fetus.\n\nJudaism unilaterally supports, in fact [[Pikuach nefesh|mandates]], abortion if doctors believe that it is necessary to save the life of the woman. Many rabbinic authorities allow abortions on the grounds of gross genetic imperfections of the fetus. They also allow abortion if the woman were suicidal because of such defects. However, Judaism holds that abortion is impermissible for family planning or convenience reasons. Each case must be decided individually, however, and the decision should lie with the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her and their Rabbi.\n\n===War, violence and pacifism===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\n{{main|Christian pacifism}}\nJews and Christians accept as valid and binding many of the same moral principles taught in the Torah. There is a great deal of overlap between the ethical systems of these two faiths. Nonetheless, there are some highly significant doctrinal differences.\n\nJudaism has many teachings about peace and compromise, and its teachings make physical violence the last possible option. Nonetheless, the Talmud teaches that \"If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense [rather than be killed]\". The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and it would also be considered helping a murderer kill someone and thus would \"place an obstacle in front of a blind man\" (i.e., makes it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with peace, and the obligation to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people.\n\nAlthough killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed [[suicide]] or mass suicide (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples). As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for \"when the knife is at the throat\", for those dying \"to sanctify God's Name\". (See: ''[[Martyrdom]]''). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities. Where some Jews regard them as examples of heroic martyrdom, but others saying that while Jews should always be willing to face martyrdom if necessary, it was wrong for them to take their own lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm|title=Judaism and Euthanasia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBecause Judaism focuses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic [[morality|moral]] [[dilemma]] of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analysed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount records that Jesus taught that if someone comes to harm you, then one must [[turn the other cheek]]. This has led four Protestant Christian denominations to develop a [[Christian pacifism|theology of pacifism]], the avoidance of force and violence at all times. They are known historically as the ''[[peace churches]]'', and have incorporated Christ's teachings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolence]] into their theology so as to apply it to participation in the use of violent force; those denominations are the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and the [[Church of the Brethren]]. Many other churches have people who hold to the doctrine without making it a part of their doctrines, or who apply it to individuals but not to governments, see also [[Evangelical counsels]]. The vast majority of Christian nations and groups have not adopted this theology, nor have they followed it in practice. See also [[But to bring a sword]].\n\n===Capital punishment===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\n{{Further|Religion and capital punishment}}\nAlthough the [[List of capital crimes in the bible|Hebrew Bible has many references to capital punishment]], the Jewish sages used their authority to make it nearly impossible for a [[Sanhedrin|Jewish court]] to impose a death sentence. Even when such a sentence might have been imposed, the [[Cities of Refuge]] and other sanctuaries, were at hand for those [[manslaughter|unintentionally guilty]] of capital offences. It was said in the Talmud about the death penalty in Judaism, that if a court killed more than one person in seventy years, it was a barbarous (or \"bloody\") court and should be condemned as such.\n\nChristianity usually reserved the death penalty for [[Christian heresy|heresy]], the denial of the orthodox view of God's view, and [[witchcraft]] or similar non-Christian practices. For example, in Spain, unrepentant Jews were exiled, and it was only those [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] who had accepted baptism under pressure but retained Jewish customs in private, who were punished in this way. It is presently acknowledged by most of Christianity that these uses of capital punishment were deeply immoral.\n\n===Taboo food and drink===\n{{Main|Taboo food and drink|Kashrut}}\nOrthodox Jews, unlike most Christians, still practice a restrictive diet that has many rules. Most Christians believe that the kosher food laws have been [[Supersessionism|superseded]], for example citing what Jesus taught in [[Mark 7]]: what you eat doesn't make you unclean but what comes out of a man's heart makes him unclean\u2014although Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have their own set of dietary observances. [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|Eastern Orthodoxy, in particular has very elaborate and strict rules of fasting]], and continues to observe the [[Council of Jerusalem]]'s apostolic decree of Act 15.<ref>[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: \"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws.\"</ref>\n\nSome Christian denominations observe some biblical food laws, for example the practice of [[Ital]] in [[Rastifarianism]]. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not eat blood products and are known for their refusal to accept [[blood transfusion]]s based on not \"eating blood\".\n\n==Salvation==\n{{Main|Salvation}}\nJudaism does not see human beings as inherently flawed or sinful and needful of being saved from it, but rather capable with a free will of being righteous, and unlike Christianity does not closely associate ideas of \"salvation\" with a New Covenant delivered by a Jewish messiah, although in Judaism Jewish people will have a renewed national commitment of observing God's commandments under the New Covenant, and the [[Jewish Messiah]] will also be ruling at a time of global peace and acceptance of God by all people.<ref>[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/faq/general_messiah-criteria02.html JfJ ''Messiah : The Criteria'']</ref>\n\nJudaism holds instead that proper living is accomplished through good works and heartfelt [[prayer]], as well as a strong faith in God. Judaism also teaches that gentiles can receive a share in \"[[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]]\". This is codified in the Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] 4:29, the Babylonian Talmud in tractates [[Avodah Zarah]] 10b, and [[Ketubot]] 111b, and in Maimonides's 12th century law code, the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', in ''Hilkhot Melachim'' (Laws of Kings) 8.11.\n\n[[Sola gratia|The Protestant view]] is that every human is a sinner, and being saved by God's grace, not simply by the merit of one's own actions, pardons a damnatory sentence to Hell.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1446. The Vatican.</ref>\n\n===Forgiveness===\n{{main|Forgiveness#Judaism|Forgiveness#Christianity}}\nIn Judaism, one must go ''to those he has harmed'' in order to be entitled to forgiveness.<ref name = YomKippur>{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm | title = ''JewFAQ discussion of forgiveness on Yom Kippur'' | accessdate = 2006-04-26}}</ref> This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs the person has done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, murder is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the grief they caused them.\n\nThus the \"reward\" for forgiving others is not God's forgiveness for wrongs done to others, but rather help ''in obtaining forgiveness from the other person.''\n\nSir [[Jonathan Sacks]], Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, summarized: \"it is not that God forgives, while human beings do not. To the contrary, we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God, so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf | title = ''Covenant and Conversation'' | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205218/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-19 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn Christianity, forgiveness by God is promised to the repentant even though the wronged party has not forgiven the offender: \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\" (1 John 1:9 ) Jesus, however, requires his disciples to forgive others if they want to be forgiven themselves. Matthew 6:14,15, which follows the Lord's Prayer, says \"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\" Forgiveness is not an option to a Christian, rather one must forgive to be a Christian.\n\n===Judgment===\n{{main|Last judgment}}\nBoth Christianity and Judaism believe in some form of judgment. Most Christians (the exception is [[Full Preterism]]) believe in the future [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, which includes the [[Resurrection of the Dead]] and the [[Last Judgment]]. Those who have accepted Jesus as their personal saviour will be saved and live in God's presence in the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], those who have not accepted Jesus as their saviour, will be cast into the [[Lake of fire|Lake of Fire]] (eternal torment, finite torment, or simply annihilated), see for example [[The Sheep and the Goats]].\n\nIn Jewish liturgy there is significant prayer and talk of a \"book of life\" that one is written into, indicating that God judges each person each year even after death. This annual judgment process begins on [[Rosh Hashanah]] and ends with [[Yom Kippur]]. Additionally, God sits daily in judgment concerning a person's daily activities. Upon the anticipated arrival of the [[Messiah]], God will judge the nations for their persecution of Israel during the exile. Later, God will also judge the Jews over their observance of the Torah.\n\n===Heaven and Hell===\n{{main|Eschatology|Heaven|Hell}}\nThere is little Jewish literature on heaven or hell as actual places, and there are few references to the afterlife in the Hebrew Bible. One is the ghostly apparition of Samuel, called up by the [[Witch of Endor]] at King Saul's command. Another is a mention by the [[Prophet Daniel]] of those who sleep in the earth rising to either everlasting life or everlasting abhorrence.<ref>Daniel 12:2</ref>\n\nEarly Hebrew views were more concerned with the fate of the nation of Israel as a whole, rather than with individual immortality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=233&letter=R&search=Resurrection|title=RESURRECTION - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> A stronger belief in an afterlife for each person developed during the Second Temple period but was contested by various Jewish sects. [[Pharisees]] believed that in death, people rest in their graves until they are physically resurrected with the coming of the Messiah, and within that resurrected body the soul would exist eternally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=252&letter=P|title=PHARISEES - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> Maimonides also included the concept of resurrection in his [[Jewish principles of faith|Thirteen Principles of Faith]].\n\nJudaism's view is summed up by a biblical observation about the Torah: in the beginning God clothes the naked (Adam), and at the end God buries the dead (Moses). The Children of Israel mourned for 40&nbsp;days, then got on with their lives.\n\nIn Judaism, [[Heaven]] is sometimes described as a place where God debates [[Talmuds|Talmudic law]] with the angels, and where Jews spend eternity studying the Written and Oral Torah. Jews do not believe in \"Hell\" as a place of eternal torment. [[Gehenna]] is a place or condition of [[purgatory]] where Jews spend up to twelve months purifying to get into heaven,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} depending on how sinful they have been, although some suggest that certain types of sinners can never be purified enough to go to heaven and rather than facing eternal torment, simply cease to exist. Therefore, some violations like suicide would be punished by separation from the community, such as not being buried in a Jewish cemetery (in practice, rabbis often rule suicides to be mentally incompetent and thus not responsible for their actions). Judaism also does not have a notion of hell as a place ruled by [[Satan]] since God's dominion is total and Satan is only one of God's angels.\n\nCatholics also believe in a [[purgatory]] for those who are going to heaven, but Christians in general believe that Hell is a fiery place of torment that never ceases, called the [[Lake of Fire]]. A small minority believe this is not permanent, and that those who go there will eventually either be saved or cease to exist. Heaven for Christians is depicted in various ways. As the [[Kingdom of God]] described in the New Testament and particularly the [[Book of Revelation]], Heaven is a new or restored earth, a [[World to Come]], free of sin and death, with a [[New Jerusalem]] led by God, Jesus, and the most righteous of believers starting with [[144,000]] Israelites from every tribe, and all others who received salvation living peacefully and making [[pilgrimages]] to give glory to the city.<ref>Book of Revelation 20\u201322</ref>\n\nIn Christianity, promises of Heaven and Hell as rewards and punishments are often used to motivate good and bad behavior, as threats of disaster were used by prophets like [[Jeremiah]] to motivate the Israelites. Modern Judaism generally rejects this form of motivation, instead teaching to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. As Maimonides wrote:\n<blockquote>\n\"A man should not say: I shall carry out the precepts of the Torah and study her wisdom in order to receive all the blessings written therein or in order to merit the life of the World to Come and I shall keep away from the sins forbidden by the Torah in order to be spared the curses mentioned in the Torah or in order not to be cut off from the life of the World to Come. It is not proper to serve God in this fashion. For one who serves thus serves out of fear. Such a way is not that of the prophets and sages. Only the ignorant, and the women and children serve God in this way. These are trained to serve out of fear until they obtain sufficient knowledge to serve out of love. One who serves God out of love studies the Torah and practices the precepts and walks in the way of wisdom for no ulterior motive at all, neither out of fear of evil nor in order to acquire the good, but follows the truth because it is true and the good will follow the merit of attaining to it. It is the stage of Abraham our father whom the Holy One, blessed be God, called \"My friend\" (Isaiah 41:8 \u2013 ''ohavi'' = the one who loves me) because he served out of love alone. It is regarding this stage that the Holy One, Blessed be God, commanded us through Moses, as it is said: \"You shall love the Lord your God\" (Deuteronomy 6:5). When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love.\n(Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159)</blockquote>\n\n===The Messiah===\n{{Main|Messiah}}\nJews believe that a descendant of [[King David]] will one day appear to restore the Kingdom of Israel and usher in an era of peace, prosperity, and spiritual understanding for Israel and all the nations of the world. Jews refer to this person as [[Jewish eschatology|Moshiach]] or \"anointed one\", translated as messiah in English. The traditional Jewish understanding of the messiah is that he is fully human and born of human parents without any supernatural element. The messiah is expected to have a relationship with God similar to that of the [[Nevi'im|prophets]] of the Tanakh. In his commentary on the Talmud, Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon) wrote:\n\n:All of the people Israel will come back to Torah; The people of Israel will be gathered back to the land of Israel; The Temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt; Israel will live among the nations as an equal, and will be strong enough to defend herself; Eventually, war, hatred and famine will end, and an era of peace and prosperity will come upon the Earth.\n\nHe adds:\n:\"And if a king shall stand up from among the House of David, studying Torah and indulging in commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will coerce all Israel to follow it and to strengthen its weak points, and will fight The Lord's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded [and won all nations surrounding him. Old prints and mss.] and built a Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the strayed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together ... But if he did not succeed until now, or if he was killed, it becomes known that he is not this one of whom the Torah had promised us, and he is indeed like all [other] proper and wholesome kings of the House of David who died.\"\n\nHe also clarified the nature of the Messiah:\n:\"Do not imagine that the anointed King must perform miracles and signs and create new things in the world or resurrect the dead and so on. The matter is not so: For Rabbi Akiba was a great scholar of the sages of the Mishnah, and he was the assistant-warrior of the king Ben Coziba Simon bar Kokhba... He and all the Sages of his generation deemed him the anointed king, until he was killed by sins; only since he was killed, they knew that he was not. The Sages asked him neither a miracle nor a sign...\"\n\nThe Christian view of Jesus as Messiah goes beyond such claims and is the fulfillment and union of three anointed offices; a prophet like Moses who delivers God's commands and covenant and frees people from bondage, a High Priest in the order of [[Melchizedek]] overshadowing the [[Levite priesthood]] and a king like King David ruling over Jews, and like God ruling over the whole world and coming from the line of David.\n\nFor Christians, Jesus is also [[hypostatic union|fully human and fully divine]] as the [[Logos|Word of God]] who sacrifices himself so that humans can receive salvation. Jesus [[Session of Christ|sits]] in [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] at the [[Right Hand of God]] and will [[Last Judgment|judge humanity]] in the [[end times]] when he [[Second Coming of Christ|returns to earth]].\n\nChristian readings of the Hebrew Bible find many references to Jesus. This can take the form of specific prophesy, and in other cases of foreshadowing by [[Typology (theology)|types]] or forerunners. Traditionally, most Christian readings of the Bible maintained that almost every prophecy was actually about the coming of Jesus, and that the entire Old Testament of the Bible is a prophecy about the [[Ministry of Jesus|coming of Jesus]].\n\n====Catholic views====\nCatholicism teaches ''[[Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus]]'' (\"Outside the Church there is no salvation\"), which some, like Fr. [[Leonard Feeney]], interpreted as limiting salvation to Catholics only. At the same time, it does not deny the possibility that those not visibly members of the Church may attain salvation as well. In recent times, its teaching has been most notably expressed in the Vatican II council documents ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' (1964), ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' (1964), ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' (1965), an encyclical issued by Pope John Paul II: ''[[Ut unum sint]]'' (1995), and in a document issued by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' in 2000. The latter document has been criticised for claiming that non-Christians are in a \"gravely deficient situation\" as compared to Catholics, but also adds that \"for those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church, salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally part of the Church, but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation.\"\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]] on October 2, 2000 emphasized that this document did not say that non-Christians were actively denied salvation: \"...this confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united\". On December 6 the Pope issued a statement to further emphasize that the Church continued to support its traditional stance that salvation was available to believers of other faiths: \"The gospel teaches us that those who live in accordance with the Beatitudes\u2014the poor in spirit, the pure of heart, those who bear lovingly the sufferings of life\u2014will enter God's kingdom.\" He further added, \"All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church, contribute under the influence of Grace to the building of this Kingdom.\" On August 13, 2002 American Catholic bishops issued a joint statement with leaders of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]], called \"Reflections on Covenant and Mission\", which affirmed that Christians should not target Jews for conversion. The document stated: \"Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God\" and \"Jews are also called by God to prepare the world for God's Kingdom.\" However, many Christian denominations still believe it is their duty to reach out to \"unbelieving\" Jews.\n\nIn December 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Jews do not need to be converted to find salvation, and that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.<ref name=\"NPR.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/10/459223058/catholics-should-not-try-to-convert-jews-vatican-commission-says|title=Catholics Should Not Try To Convert Jews, Vatican Commission Says|date=10 December 2015|work=NPR.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Philip Pullella\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-jews-idUSKBN0TT1BK20151210#bdz0KPLr1Y8xfUAR.97|title=Vatican says Catholics should not try to convert Jews, should fight anti-semitism|author=Philip Pullella|date=10 December 2015|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref name=\"news.va\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|title=Vatican issues new document on Christian-Jewish dialogue|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Eastern Orthodox views====\nEastern Orthodox Christianity emphasizes a continuing life of repentance or ''metanoia'', which includes an increasing improvement in thought, belief and action. Regarding the salvation of Jews, [[Muslims]], and other non-Christians, the Orthodox have traditionally taught that there is no salvation outside the church. Orthodoxy recognizes that other religions may contain truth, to the extent that they are in agreement with Christianity.\n\nMany Orthodox theologians{{who|date=December 2010}} believe that all people will have an opportunity to embrace union with God, including Jesus, after their death, and so become part of the Church at that time.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} God is thought to be good, just, and merciful; it would not seem just to condemn someone because they never heard the Gospel message, or were taught a distorted version of the Gospel by [[Heresy|heretics]]. Therefore, the reasoning goes, they must at some point have an opportunity to make a genuine informed decision.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Ultimately, those who persist in rejecting God condemn themselves, by cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of all Life, and from the God who is Love embodied. Jews, Muslims, and members of other faiths, then, are expected to convert to Christianity in the afterlife.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (which is not part of Eastern Orthodoxy) also holds this belief, and performs [[baptism for the dead]], in which people are baptized in behalf of their ancestors who, it is believed, are given the opportunity to accept the ordinance.\n\n===Proselytizing===\nJudaism is not a [[proselytizing]] religion. Orthodox Judaism deliberately makes it very difficult to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] and become a Jew, and requires a significant and full-time effort in living, study, righteousness, and conduct over several years. The final decision is by no means a foregone conclusion. A person cannot become Jewish by marrying a Jew, or by joining a synagogue, nor by any degree of involvement in the community or religion, but only by explicitly undertaking intense, formal, and supervised work over years aimed towards that goal. Some less strict versions of Judaism have made this process somewhat easier but it is still far from common.\n\nIn the past, Judaism was more evangelistic,<ref>H.H. Ben-Sasson's ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, p. 288: \"Explicit evidence of a systematic attempt to propagate the Jewish faith in the city of Rome is found as early as 139 BCE. With the increase of the Jewish population of Rome, the Jews intensified their efforts to make converts among the Romans. Although the activity of Jewish missionaries in Roman society caused Tiberius to expel them from that city in 19 CE, they soon returned, and Jewish religious propaganda was resumed and maintained even after the destruction of the Temple. Tacitus mentions it regretfully (''Histories'' 5.5), and Juvenal, in his Fourteenth Satire (11. 96ff.), describes how Roman families 'degenerated' into Judaism: the fathers permitted themselves to adopt some of its customs and the sons became Jews in every respect. ... the Bible provided the apostles of Judaism with a literature unparalleled in any other religion.\"</ref> but this was often more akin just to \"greater openness to converts\" rather than active soliciting of conversions. Since Jews believe that one need not be a Jew to approach God, there is no religious pressure to convert non-Jews to their faith.\n\nThe [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]] has been an exception to this non-proselytizing standard, since in recent decades it has been actively promoting Noahide Laws for gentiles as an alternative to Christianity.<ref>[http://www.noahide.org/article.asp?Level=493&Parent=88 ''The Seven Laws of Noah and the Non-Jews who Follow Them ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128101917/http://noahide.org/article.asp?Level=493&Parent=88 |date=2007-11-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.J.RES.104.ENR:], 102nd Congress of the United States of America, March 5, 1991.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Christianity is an explicitly [[evangelism|evangelistic]] religion. Christians are commanded by Jesus to \"[[Great Commission|Therefore go and make disciples of all nations]]\". Historically, evangelism has on rare occasions led to [[forced conversion]] under threat of death or mass expulsion.\n\n==Mutual views==\n\n===Common Jewish views of Christianity===\n{{Main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}\nMany Jews view Jesus as one in a long list of failed [[List of messiah claimants|Jewish claimants to be the Messiah]], none of whom fulfilled the [[Jewish view of Jesus#Prophecy and Jesus|tests]] of a prophet specified in the Law of Moses. Others see Jesus as a teacher who worked with the gentiles and ascribe the messianic claims that Jews find objectionable to his later followers. Because much physical and spiritual violence was done to Jews in the name of Jesus and his followers,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and because [[evangelism]] is still an active aspect of many church's activities, many Jews are uncomfortable with discussing Jesus and treat him as a [[Yeshu|non-person]]. In answering the question \"What do Jews think of Jesus\", philosopher Milton Steinberg claims, for Jews, Jesus cannot be accepted as anything more than a teacher. \"In only a few respects did Jesus deviate from the Tradition,\" Steinberg concludes, \"and in all of them, Jews believe, he blundered.\"<ref>M. Steinberg, 1975 ''Basic Judaism'' p. 108, New York: Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich</ref>\n\nJudaism does not believe that God requires the sacrifice of any human. This is emphasized in Jewish traditions concerning the story of the [[Binding of Isaac|Akedah]], the binding of Isaac. In the Jewish explanation, this is a story in the Torah whereby God wanted to test Abraham's faith and willingness, and Isaac was never going to be actually sacrificed. Thus, Judaism rejects the notion that anyone can or should die for anyone else's sin.<ref>Spiegel, 1993</ref> Judaism is more focused on the practicalities of understanding how one may live a sacred life in the world according to God's will, rather than a hope of a future one. Judaism does not believe in the Christian concept of hell but does have a punishment stage in the afterlife (i.e. Gehenna, the New Testament word translated as hell) as well as a Heaven ([[Olam Haba|Gan Eden]]), but the religion does not intend it as a focus.\n\nJudaism views the worship of Jesus as inherently polytheistic, and rejects the Christian attempts to explain the [[Trinity]] as a complex monotheism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Christian festivals have no religious significance in Judaism and are not celebrated, but some secular Jews in the West treat [[Christmas]] as a secular holiday.\n\n===Common Christian views of Judaism===\nChristians believe that Christianity is the fulfillment and successor of Judaism, retaining much of its doctrine and many of its practices including [[monotheism]], the belief in a Messiah, and certain forms of worship like prayer and reading from religious texts. Christians believe that Judaism requires blood sacrifice to atone for sins, and believe that Judaism has abandoned this since the [[destruction of the Second Temple]]. Most Christians consider the Mosaic Law to have been a necessary intermediate stage, but that once the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] occurred, adherence to civil and ceremonial Law was superseded by the New Covenant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+7:11-28;&version=31;|title=Bible Gateway passage: Hebrews 7:11-28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians adhere to [[New Covenant theology]], which states that with the arrival of his New Covenant, Jews have ceased being blessed under his [[Mosaic covenant]]. This position has been softened or disputed by other Christians, where Jews are recognized to have a special status under the [[Abrahamic covenant]]. New Covenant theology is thus in contrast to [[Dual-covenant theology]].\n\nSome Christians who view the Jewish people as close to God seek to understand and incorporate elements of Jewish understanding or perspective into their beliefs as a means to respect their \"parent\" religion of Judaism, or to more fully seek out and return to their Christian roots. Christians embracing aspects of Judaism are sometimes criticized as Biblical [[Judaizers]] by Christians when they pressure gentile Christians to observe Mosaic teachings rejected by most modern Christians.\n\n=== Messianic Judaism ===\n{{Main|Messianic Judaism}}\n\n=== Jewish Christians ===\n{{Main|Jewish Christian}}\nSome scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and rabbinic movements from the mid- to late second century CE to the fourth century CE.<ref>See for instance: Lily C. Vuong, ''Gender and Purity in the Protevangelium of James'', WissenschaftlicheUntersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 2.358 (T\u00fcbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2013), 210\u201313; Jonathan Bourgel, \"The Holders of the \u201cWord of Truth\u201d: The Pharisees in Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions 1.27\u201371,\" ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 25.2 (2017) 171\u2013200.</ref>\n\n==Inter-relationship==\n{{See also|Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christian anti-Judaism|Anti-Christian}}\nIn addition to each having varied views on the other as a religion, there has also been a long and often painful [[Christianity and anti-Semitism|history]] of conflict, persecution and at times, reconciliation, between the two religions, which have influenced their mutual views of their relationship over time.\n\nSince the time of the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] upheld ''Constitution pro Jud\u00e6is'' (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated {{quotation|We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live.\"<ref name=\"BaskinSeeskin2010\">{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Judith R.|last2=Seeskin|first2=Kenneth|title=The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521869607|page=120}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Persecution]], forcible conversion, and forcible [[Forced migration|displacement]] of Jews ([[i.e.]] [[hate crime]]s) occurred for many centuries, with occasional gestures to reconciliation from time to time. [[Pogroms]] were common throughout Christian Europe, including organized violence, restrictive land ownership and professional lives, forcible relocation and [[ghetto]]ization, mandatory dress codes, and at times humiliating actions and [[torture]]. All had major effects on Jewish cultures. There have also been non-coercive outreach and missionary efforts such as the [[Church of England]]'s [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|Ministry Among Jewish People]], founded in 1809.\n\nFor Martin Buber, Judaism and Christianity were variations on the same theme of messianism.  Buber made this theme the basis of a famous definition of the tension between Judaism and Christianity:\n<blockquote>\nPre-messianically, our destinies are divided. Now to the Christian, the Jew is the incomprehensibly obdurate man who declines to see what has happened; and to the Jew, the Christian is the incomprehensibly daring man who affirms in an unredeemed world that its redemption has been accomplished. This is a gulf which no human power can bridge.<ref>Martin Buber, \"The Two Foci of the Jewish Soul\", cited in The Writings of Martin Buber, Will Herberg (editor), New York: Meridian Books, 1956, p. 276.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] was known for its [[Kirchenkampf|persecution of Christian Churches]]; many of them, such as the Protestant [[Confessing Church]] and the Catholic Church,<ref>Gill, Anton (1994).

One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law \"which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent.\" Another was to help those \"who suffered through repressive laws, or violence.\" About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends\u2014German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries\u2014were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ...

He was born in Rome\u2014in either 1475 or 1476\u2014the illegitimate son of Cardinal Roderic Llan\u00e7ol i de Borja, usually known as \"Rodrigo Borgia\", later [[Pope Alexander VI]], and his mistress [[Vannozza dei Cattanei]], about whom information is sparse. The Borgia family originally came from the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], and rose to prominence during the mid-15th century; Cesare's great-uncle Alphonso Borgia (1378\u20131458), bishop of Valencia, was elected [[Pope Callixtus III]] in 1455.<ref name=\"xvfywc\">Herfried M\u00fcnkler and Marina M\u00fcnkler, ''Lexikon der Renaissance'', Munich: Beck, 2000, pp. 43ff.{{de icon}}</ref> Cesare's father, Pope Alexander VI, was the first pope who openly recognized his children born out of wedlock.\n\n[[Stefano Infessura]] writes that Cardinal Borgia falsely claimed Cesare to be the legitimate son of another man\u2014Domenico d'Arignano, the nominal husband of Vannozza dei Cattanei. More likely, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted Cesare a release from the necessity of proving his birth in a [[papal bull]] of 1 October 1480.<ref>Sabatini (pp. 45, 48), citing the supplement to the Appendix of Thuasne's edition of Burchard's ''Diarium''</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Church office===\nCesare was initially groomed for a career in the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. Following school in [[Perugia]] and [[Pisa]], Cesare studied law at the ''Studium Urbis'' (nowadays [[Sapienza University of Rome]]). He was made Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela|Pamplona]] at the age of 15 and archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Valencia]] at 17. In 1493, he had also been appointed bishop of both [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Albi|Castres]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Perpignan-Elne|Elne]]. In 1494, he also received the title of abbot of the [[abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa]].<ref>{{66 PHPC}}</ref>  Along with his father's elevation to Pope, Cesare was made [[Catholic Cardinal|Cardinal]] at the age of 18.<ref name=\"xvfywc\" />\n\nAlexander VI staked the hopes of the Borgia family on Cesare's brother [[Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia|Giovanni]], who was made captain general of the military forces of the papacy. Giovanni was assassinated in 1497 in mysterious circumstances. Several contemporaries suggested that Cesare might have been his killer,<ref>Spinosa, ''La saga dei Borgia''</ref> as Giovanni's disappearance could finally open to him a long-awaited military career and also solve the jealousy over [[Sancha of Aragon]], wife of Cesare's younger brother, [[Gioffre Borgia|Gioffre]], and mistress of both Cesare and Giovanni.<ref>Rendina, ''I capitani di ventura''</ref> Cesare's role in the act has never been clear. However, he had no definitive motive, as he was likely to be given a powerful secular position, whether or not his brother lived. It is more likely that Giovanni was killed as a result of a sexual liaison.<ref>Michael de la Bedoyere, ''The Meddlesome Friar and the Wayward Pope'', p. 20, Quote: \"Next morning the absence of the Duke was noticed by his servants, and the Pontiff was informed. He was not too worried for, as Burchard says, Alexander jumped to the conclusion that his son had spent the night with some girl and preferred to avoid the indiscretion of leaving by day. It may be mentioned in passing that this touch, as with many others one comes across, hardly squares with the general view that the Pope, his family and those around him were without shame. Juan was a dissolute young man and not a churchman, yet Alexander presumed on a discretion more in keeping with later times.\"</ref>\n\nOn 17 August 1498, Cesare became the first person in history to resign the cardinalate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in Catholic History|url=http://catholicunderthehood.com/2010/08/17/today-in-catholic-history-cesare-borgia-resigns-from-the-cardinalate/|publisher=Catholic Under the Hood|accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> On the same day, [[Louis XII of France]] named Cesare [[Duke of Valentinois]], and this title, along with his former position as Cardinal of Valencia, explains the nickname \"Valentino\".\n\n===Military===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nCesare's career was founded upon his father's ability to distribute patronage, along with his alliance with France (reinforced by his marriage with [[Charlotte d'Albret]], sister of [[John III of Navarre]]), in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]. Louis XII invaded Italy in 1499: after [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]] had ousted its duke [[Ludovico Sforza]], Cesare accompanied the king in his entrance into [[Milan]].\n[[File:Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois.jpg|thumb|Profile portrait of Cesare Borgia in the [[Palazzo Venezia]] in [[Rome]], ca. 1500\u201310]]\nAt this point Alexander decided to profit from the favourable situation and carve out for Cesare a state of his own in northern Italy. To this end, he declared that all his vicars in [[Romagna]] and [[Marche]] were deposed. Though in theory subject directly to the pope, these rulers had been practically independent or dependent on other states for generations. In the view of the citizens, these vicars were cruel and petty. When Cesare eventually took power, he was viewed by the citizens as a great improvement.\n\nCesare was appointed commander of the papal armies with a number of Italian mercenaries, supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry sent by the King of France. Alexander sent him to capture [[Imola]] and [[Forl\u00ec]], ruled by [[Caterina Sforza]] (mother of the Medici ''condottiero'' [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere]]). Despite being deprived of his French troops after the conquest of those two cities, Borgia returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph and to receive the title of [[Gonfalonier of the Church|Papal Gonfalonier]] from his father. In 1500 the creation of twelve new cardinals granted Alexander enough money for Cesare to hire the ''condottieri,'' [[Vitellozzo Vitelli]], [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]], [[Giulio Orsini|Giulio]] and [[Paolo Orsini]], and [[Oliverotto Euffreducci]], who resumed his campaign in Romagna.\n\n[[Giovanni Sforza]], first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from [[Pesaro]]; [[Pandolfo IV Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] lost [[Rimini]]; [[Faenza]] surrendered, its young lord [[Astorre III Manfredi]] being later drowned in the [[Tiber]] by Cesare's order. In May 1501 the latter was created duke of Romagna. Hired by Florence, Cesare subsequently added the lordship of [[Piombino]] to his new lands.\n\nWhile his ''condottieri'' took over the siege of Piombino (which ended in 1502), Cesare commanded the French troops in the sieges of Naples and [[Capua]], defended by [[Prospero Colonna|Prospero]] and [[Fabrizio Colonna]]. On 24 June 1501 his troops stormed the latter, causing the collapse of Aragonese power in southern Italy.\n\nIn June 1502 he set out for Marche, where he was able to capture [[Urbino]] and [[Camerino]] by treason. He planned to conquer [[Bologna]] next. However, his ''condottieri'', most notably Vitellozzo Vitelli and the Orsini brothers ([[Giulio Orsini|Giulio]], Paolo and Francesco), feared Cesare's cruelty and set up a plot against him. [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]] and [[Giovanni Maria da Varano]] returned to Urbino and Camerino, and [[Fossombrone]] revolted. The fact that his subjects had enjoyed his rule thus far meant that his opponents had to work much harder than they would have liked. He eventually recalled his loyal generals to Imola, where he waited for his opponents' loose alliance to collapse. Cesare called for a reconciliation, but imprisoned his ''condottieri'' in [[Senigallia]], then called Sinigaglia, a feat described as a \"wonderful deceiving\" by [[Paolo Giovio]],<ref>Rendina, p. 250.</ref> and had them executed.\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:Cesare-borgia-leaving-the-vatican-giuseppe-lorenzo-gatteri.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cesare Borgia leaving the Vatican'' (1877) by [[Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri]]]]\nAlthough he was an immensely capable general and statesman, Cesare had trouble maintaining his domain without continued Papal patronage. [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] cites Cesare's dependence on the good will of the Papacy, under the control of his father, to be the principal disadvantage of his rule. Machiavelli argued that, had Cesare been able to win the favour of the new Pope, he would have been a very successful ruler. The news of his father's death (1503) arrived when Cesare was planning the conquest of [[Tuscany]]. While he was convalescing in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], his troops controlled the conclave.\n\nThe new pope, [[Pope Pius III]], supported Cesare Borgia and reconfirmed him as [[Gonfaloniere]]; but after a brief pontificate of twenty-six days, he died. Borgia's deadly enemy, Giuliano Della Rovere, then succeeded by dexterous diplomacy in tricking the weakened Cesare Borgia into supporting him by offering him money and continued papal backing for Borgia policies in the Romagna; promises which he disregarded upon election. He was elected as [[Pope Julius II]] by the near-unanimous vote of the cardinals.

In 1504 he was transferred to [[Spain]] and imprisoned first in the Castle of [[Chinchilla de Montearag\u00f3n]] in La Mancha, but after an attempted escape he was moved north to the [[Castle of La Mota]], [[Medina del Campo]], near Segovia.<ref name=BK10 /> He did manage to escape from the Castle of La Mota with assistance, and after running across [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], he made it to [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]] on 3 December 1506, and was much welcomed by King [[John III of Navarre]],<ref name=BK11>Bustillo Kastrexana, J. p. 11</ref> who was missing an experienced military commander, ahead of the feared [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Castilian invasion (1512)]].\n\nHe recaptured [[Viana, Spain|Viana, Navarre]], then in the hands of forces loyal to the count of Ler\u00edn, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]'s conspiratorial ally in [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest|Navarre]], but not [[castle of Viana|the castle]], which he then besieged. In the early morning of 11 March 1507, an enemy party of knights fled from the castle during a heavy storm. Outraged at the ineffectiveness of the siege, the Italian commander chased them only to find himself on his own. The party of knights discovered Borgia was alone, and trapped him in an ambush. Borgia received a fatal injury from a spear. He was then stripped of all his luxurious garments, valuables and a leather mask covering half his face (disfigured possibly by [[syphilis]] during his late years). Borgia was left lying naked, with just a red tile covering his genitals.<ref name=BK11 />\n\n==Remains==\nBorgia was originally buried in a marbled mausoleum [[John III of Navarre|John III]] had ordered built at the altar of the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda in Viana, set on one of the stops on the [[Camino de Santiago]]. In the 16th century the [[bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo]], [[Antonio de Guevara]], published from memory what he had seen written on the tomb when he had paid a visit to the church. This epitaph underwent several changes in wording and meter throughout the years and the version most commonly cited today is that published by the priest and historian Francisco de Ales\u00f3n in the 18th century. It reads:<ref>{{cite book |last=Moret |first=Jos\u00e9 de |last2=Ales\u00f3n |first2=Francisco de |date=1891 |title=Anales del reino de Navarra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQRXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA193 |volume=7 |location=Toloso, Spain |publisher=E.

While the circumstances are not well known, the tomb was destroyed sometime between 1523 and 1608, during which time Santa Mar\u00eda was undergoing renovation and expansion. Tradition goes that a [[bishop of Calahorra]] considered inappropriate to have the remains of \"that degenerate\" lying in the church, so the opportunity was taken to tear down the monument and expel Borgia's bones to where they were reburied under the street in front of the church to be trodden on by all who walked through the town.\n\n[[Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]], in ''A los pies de Venus'', writes that the then Bishop of Santa Mar\u00eda had Borgia expelled from the church because his own father had died after being imprisoned under Alexander VI. It was held for many years that the bones were lost, although in fact local tradition continued to mark their place quite accurately and folklore sprung up around Borgia's death and ghost. The bones were in fact dug up twice and reburied once by historians (both local and international\u2014the first dig in 1886 involved the French historian [[Charles Yriarte]], who also published works on the Borgias) seeking the resting place of the infamous Cesare Borgia. After Borgia was unearthed for the second time in 1945 his bones were taken for a rather lengthy forensic examination by Victoriano Juaristi, a surgeon by trade and Borgia aficionado, and the tests concurred with the preliminary ones carried out in the 19th century. There was evidence that the bones belonged to Borgia.\n\nCesare Borgia's remains then were sent to Viana's town hall, directly across from Santa Mar\u00eda, where they remained until 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/100356277|title=BORGIA 3 -The Quest For Cesare&#039;s Tomb|author=|website=Borgia Season 3: Behind the Scenes: Mark Ryder and Tom Fontana travel to Spain, to search for the real Cesare Borgia's tomb.|date=2014-07-09|publisher=|accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref> They were then reburied immediately outside of the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda, no longer under the street and in direct danger of being stepped on. A memorial stone{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was placed over it which, translated into English, declared Borgia the ''Generalisimo'' of the papal as well as the Navarrese forces. A movement was made in the late 80s to have Borgia dug up once more and put back into Santa Mar\u00eda, but this proposal was ultimately rejected by church officials due to recent ruling against the interment of anyone who did not hold the title of pope or cardinal. Since Borgia had renounced the cardinalate it was decided that it would be inappropriate for his bones to be moved into the church. However, [[Fernando Sebasti\u00e1n Aguilar]], the Archbishop of Pamplona, acquiesced after more than 50 years of petitions and Borgia was finally moved back inside the church on 11 March 2007, the day before the 500th anniversary of his death.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1540315/The-rehabilitation-of-Cesare-Borgia.html \"The rehabilitation of Cesare Borgia\"] by Malcolm Moore, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 23 January 2007</ref> \"We have nothing against the transfer of his remains.

Machiavelli was at Borgia's court from 7 October 1502 through 18 January 1503. During this time he wrote regular dispatches to his superiors in Florence, many of which have survived and are published in Machiavelli's Collected Works. In ''[[The Prince]]'', Machiavelli uses Borgia as an example to elucidate the dangers of acquiring a principality by virtue of another. Although Cesare Borgia's father gave him the power to set up, Cesare ruled the Romagna with skill and tact for the most part. However, when his father died, and a rival to the Borgia family entered the Papal seat, Cesare was overthrown in a matter of months.\n\nMachiavelli attributes two episodes to Cesare Borgia: the method by which the Romagna was pacified, which Machiavelli describes in chapter VII of ''[[The Prince]]'', and the assassination of his captains on New Year's Eve of 1502 in Senigallia.<ref>Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, \"A Description of the Method Used by Duke Valentino in Killing Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, and Others\", ''The Chief Works and Others'', trans.

Mansfield, ''Machiavelli's Virtue'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Borgia and Leonardo==\nCesare Borgia briefly employed [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as military architect and engineer between 1502 and 1503. Cesare provided Leonardo with an unlimited pass to inspect and direct all ongoing and planned construction in his domain.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} While in Romagna, Leonardo built the canal from Cesena to the Porto Cesenatico.<ref>Rafael Sabatini, ''The Life of Cesare Borgia'', 3rd edn (London:Stanley Paul, [[Sine anno|n.d.]]), [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofcesareborg00sabarich#page/291 p.291] [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3467]</ref> Before meeting Cesare, Leonardo had worked at the Milanese court of [[Ludovico Sforza]] for many years, until [[Louis XII of France]] drove Sforza out of Italy. After Cesare, Leonardo was unsuccessful in finding another patron in Italy. King [[Francis I of France]] was able to convince Leonardo to enter his service, and the last three years of Leonardo's life were spent working in France.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 10 May 1499, Cesare married [[Charlotte of Albret]] (1480 \u2013 11 March 1514). She was a sister of [[John III of Navarre]]. They were parents to a daughter, [[Louise Borgia, Duchess of Valentinois]], (1500\u20131553) who first married [[Louis II de la Tr\u00e9moille]], Governor of Burgundy, and secondly Philippe de Bourbon (1499\u20131557), Seigneur de [[Bourbon-Busset|Busset]].\n\nCesare was also father to at least 11 illegitimate children, among them Girolamo Borgia, who married Isabella Contessa di Carpi, and Lucrezia Borgia (the younger), who, after Cesare's death, was moved to Ferrara to the court of her aunt, the elder [[Lucrezia Borgia]].\n\n==Character discussed in works of philosophy==\n* ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\n* ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' (1895) by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] Af. #46 & #61\n* ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886) by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] Af. #197\n* ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' (1889) by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] Af. #37\n\n==In literature==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''The Borgias'' (1802) by [[Alexandre Dumas|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\n* ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' (1844) by [[Alexandre Dumas|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\n* ''The Banner of the Bull'' (1915) by [[Rafael Sabatini]]\n* ''[[Then and Now (novel)|Then and Now]]'' (1946) by [[W.

Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.\n\nChronicler information sources vary; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down.<ref name=\"MGME19-20\">Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts, Memory and Gender in Medieval Europe: 900\u20131200 (Toronto ; Buffalo : University of Toronto Press, 1999), pp. 19\u201320</ref>  Some used written material: Charters, letters, or the works of earlier chroniclers.<ref name=\"MGME19-20\"/> Still others are tales of such unknown origins so as to hold mythical status.<ref name=\"MGME19-20\"/> Copyists also affected chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original author(s).<ref name=\"MGME19-20\"/>  The reliability of a particular chronicle is an important determination for modern historians.<ref name=\"MGME19-20\"/>\n\nIn modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a [[universal chronicle]].\n\n==Subgroups==\nScholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A ''dead'' chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A ''live'' chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as [[annals]], over dead ones.\n\nThe term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. The earliest medieval chronicle to combine both retrospective (''dead'') and contemporary (''live'') entries, is the [[Chronicle of Ireland]], which spans the years 431 to 911.<ref>Roy Flechner, '\"The Chronicle of Ireland: Then and Now\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' v.21:4(2013)422-54  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/emed.12025/abstract Article]</ref>\n\nChronicles are the predecessors of modern \"[[time line]]s\" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent [[continuator]]s. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called [[annal]]s. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point of view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual [[abbey]]s.\n\nIt is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle]]'' lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.\n\n==English chronicles==\nThe most important [[List of English chronicles|English chronicles]] are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'' (1577\u201387) by [[Raphael Holinshed]] and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.<ref>'A Glossary of Literary Terms' \u2013 M.H.

Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: [[Concentration#Mass concentration|mass concentration]], [[Concentration#Molar concentration|molar concentration]], [[Concentration#Number concentration|number concentration]], and [[Concentration#Volume concentration|volume concentration]].<ref name=\"goldbook\">{{GoldBookRef | file = C01222 | title = concentration}}</ref> A concentration can be any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently solutes and solvents in [[solution]]s. The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as [[normal concentration]] and [[osmotic concentration]].\n\n==Qualitative description==\n\n[[Image:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|right|These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right.]]\n\nOften in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] way, through the use of adjectives such as \"dilute\" for solutions of relatively low concentration and \"concentrated\" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To '''concentrate''' a solution, one must add more [[solution|solute]] (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of [[solvent]] (for example, water). By contrast, to '''dilute''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are ''fully'' [[miscible]] there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when [[supersaturation]] may occur. Instead, [[Phase (matter)#Phase separation|phase separation]] will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.\n\nConcentrations are often called '''levels''', reflecting the mental [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[ordinate|levels on the vertical axis]] of a [[chart|graph]], which can be [[height|high or low]] (for example, \"high serum levels of bilirubin\" are concentrations of [[bilirubin]] in the [[serum (blood)|blood serum]] that are greater [[Reference ranges for blood tests#Bilirubin reference ranges|than normal]]).\n\n==Quantitative notation==\n\nThere are four quantities that describe concentration:\n\n===Mass concentration===\n{{main|Mass concentration (chemistry)}}\n\nThe mass concentration <math>\\rho_i</math> is defined as the [[mass]] of a constituent <math>m_i</math> divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>\\rho_i = \\frac {m_i}{V}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/m<sup>3</sup> (equal to g/L).\n\n===Molar concentration===\n{{main|Molar concentration}}\n\nThe molar concentration <math>c_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>c_i = \\frac {n_i}{V}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is mol/m<sup>3</sup>. However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) is used.\n\n===Number concentration===\n{{main|Number concentration}}\n\nThe number concentration <math>C_i</math> is defined as the number of entities of a constituent <math>N_i</math> in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>C_i = \\frac{N_i}{V}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is 1/m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n===Volume concentration===\n\nThe '''volume concentration''' <math>\\phi_i</math> (not to be confused with [[volume fraction]]<ref name=\"goldbook2\">{{GoldBookRef | file = V06643 | title = volume fraction}}</ref>) is defined as the volume of a constituent <math>V_i</math> divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:\n\n:<math>\\phi_i = \\frac {V_i}{V}.</math>\n\nBeing dimensionless, it is expressed as a number, e.g., 0.18 or 18%; its unit is 1.\n\n==Related quantities==\n\nSeveral other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture.

However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mole ratios.\n\n===Mass fraction===\n{{main|Mass fraction (chemistry)}}\n\nThe mass fraction <math>w_i</math> is the fraction of one substance with mass <math>m_i</math> to the mass of the total mixture <math>m_\\mathrm{tot}</math>, defined as:\n\n:<math>w_i = \\frac {m_i}{m_\\mathrm{tot}}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/kg.

She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name [[Four Bitchin' Babes]].  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including her latest ''Just One Angel'', 22 singer/songwriters singing Christmas/Hanukah/Solstice/New Year's songs including actor [[Jeff Daniels]], Grammy-winners [[Janis Ian]] and [[Julie Gold]], and the Guitar Man Of Central Park [[David Ippolito]].\n\nShe is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between emotional reflections on romance and outright comedy. One of Lavin's songs, ''\"Regretting What I Said to You When You Called Me 11:00 On a Friday Morning to Tell Me that at 1:00 Friday Afternoon You're Gonna Leave Your Office, Go Downstairs, Hail a Cab to Go Out to the Airport to Catch a Plane to Go Skiing in the Alps for Two Weeks, Not that I Wanted to Go With You, I Wasn't Able to Leave Town, I'm Not a Very Good Skier, I Couldn't Expect You to Pay My Way, But After Going Out With You for Three Years I DON'T Like Surprises!! Subtitled: A Musical Apology\"'' is notable for its long title. It is the eighth song on her 1984 album ''Future Fossils'', and is 3:04 (3 minutes and 4 seconds) long.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nLavin worked at [[Caffe Lena]] in [[Saratoga, New York]], until [[Dave Van Ronk]] convinced her to move to New York City and make a career as a singer-songwriter. She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. Lavin was the original host of ''Sunday Breakfast'' on [[WFUV]] in New York City. She was a founding member of the [[Four Bitchin' Babes]] when they were formed in 1990.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carlin|first1=Richard|title=American Popular Music: Folk|date=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LluEHF1oT-wC|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poetinmo.com/press/LavinPR.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215100042/http://www.poetinmo.com/press/LavinPR.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}</ref>==\n* The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] 43rd Annual Deems Taylor Award for her book ''Cold Pizza For Breakfast: A Mem-Wha??'', 2011\n* The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Foundation Jamie deRoy and Friends Award, 2010\n* Top 100 of the Most Influential Artists in the Last 15 Years, ''Singer Songwriter Magazine''\n* Top 30 iPod Singer/Songwriters of Choice, WUMB, Boston 2006\n* ASCAP Composer Award 1992, 1993, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2006\n* Singer/Songwriter of the Year, ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] Magazine'', NYC 2001\n* Honorable Mention, [[American Association of Independent Music|NAIRD]] Singer / Songwriter Album of the Year, 1996: ''Please Don\u2019t Make Me Too Happy''\n* New York Music Award Folk Artist of the Year 1990, 1992\n* World Folk Music Association Kate Wolf Memorial Award 1990\n* NAIRD Folk Album of the Year, 1988: ''Good Thing He Can\u2019t Read My Mind''\n\n==Discography==\n\n* ''Absolutely Live'' (1981; re-issued by Winthrop, 2000)\n* ''Future Fossils'' (Philo, 1984)\n* ''Beau Woes and Other Problems of Modern Life'' (Philo, 1986)\n* ''Another Woman's Man'' (Philo, 1987)\n* ''Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind'' (Philo, 1988)\n* ''Attainable Love'' (Philo, 1990)\n* ''Compass'' (Philo, 1991)\n* ''Live at the Cactus Cafe: What Was I Thinking?''

After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one,<ref>Miksa, Francis L., ed. ''Charles Ammi Cutter: Library Systematizer\". Littleton, CO, Libraries Unlimited. 1977, p. 58.</ref> and Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows.<ref>Cutter, C. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891\u201393, p. 21\u201323.</ref>\n\n==Summary of the Expansive Classification schedules==\n\n===First classification===\nThe first classification is meant for only the very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top level classes, and only eight classes in all.\n\n* '''A''' Works of reference and general works which include several of the following sections, and so could not go in any one.\n* '''B''' [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Outline of religion|Religion]]\n* '''E''' Biography\n* '''F''' [[Outline of history|History]] and [[Outline of geography|Geography]] and Travels\n* '''H''' [[Outline of social science|Social sciences]]\n* '''L''' [[Outline of natural science|Natural sciences]] and [[The arts|Arts]]\n* '''Y''' [[Outline of linguistics|Language]] and [[Outline of literature|Literature]]\n* '''YF''' [[Outline of fiction|Fiction]]\n\n===Further classifications===\nFurther expansions add more top level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout.<ref>https://archive.org/details/cu31924092476229</ref>\n\nBy the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top level classes. These are:\n\n* '''A''' General Works\n* '''B''' [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]]\n* '''C''' [[Outline of Christianity|Christianity]] and [[Outline of Judaism|Judaism]]\n* '''D''' Ecclesiastical History\n* '''E''' Biography\n* '''F''' [[Outline of history|History]], Universal History\n* '''G''' [[Outline of geography|Geography]] and Travels\n* '''H''' [[Outline of social science|Social Sciences]]\n* '''I''' Demotics, [[Outline of sociology|Sociology]]\n* '''J''' Civics, Government, [[Outline of political science|Political Science]]\n* '''K''' Legislation\n* '''L''' [[Outline of science|Science]] and [[The arts|Arts]] together\n* '''M''' Natural History\n* '''N''' [[Outline of botany|Botany]]\n* '''O''' [[Outline of zoology|Zoology]]\n* '''P''' [[Outline of anthropology|Anthropology]] and Ethnology\n* '''Q''' [[Outline of medicine|Medicine]]\n* '''R''' Useful arts, [[Outline of technology|Technology]]\n* '''S''' Constructive arts ([[Outline of engineering|Engineering]] and [[Outline of construction|Building]])\n* '''T''' [[Outline of manufacturing|Manufactures]] and Handicrafts\n* '''U''' [[Outline of military science and technology|Art of War]]\n* '''V''' Recreative arts, [[Outline of sports|Sports]], [[Outline of games|Games]], [[Outline of festivals|Festivals]]\n* '''W''' [[Outline of the visual arts|Art]]\n* '''X''' English Language\n* '''Y''' English and American literature\n* '''Z''' Book arts\n\nThese schedules were not meant to be fixed, but were to be adapted to meet the needs of each library. For example, books on the English language may be put in X, and books on language in general in a subclass of X, or this can be reversed. The first option is less logical, but results in shorter marks for most English language libraries.<ref>Cutter, C. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891\u201393, p. 27.</ref>\n\n==How Expansive Classification call numbers are constructed==\n{{Expand section|citations and corrections|date=August 2011}}\nMost call numbers in the Expansive Classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Expansive Classification are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.\n\nSize of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //).\n\nFor some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States&mdash;hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.\n\nThe second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a, b, c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number&mdash;e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.\n\nOn the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English&mdash;other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.\n\n=== Cutter numbers (Cutter codes) ===\n{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=August 2011}}\nOne of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules.  Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Cutter table\n|-\n! || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9\n|-\n| S || a || ch || e || h\u2013i || m\u2013p || t || u || w\u2013z\n|-\n| Qu || || a || e || i || o || r || t || y\n|-\n| other consonants || || a || e || i || o || r || u || y\n|-\n| vowels || b || d || l\u2013m || n || p || r || s\u2013t || u\u2013y\n|-\n| additional letters || || a\u2013d || e\u2013h || i\u2013l || m\u2013o || p\u2013s || t\u2013v || w\u2013z\n|}\n\nInitial letters Qa\u2013Qt are assigned Q2\u2013Q29, while entries beginning with numerals have a Cutter number A12\u2013A19, therefore sorting before the first A entry.<ref>{{cite web|title=LC Cutter Tables |url=http://staff.library.mun.ca/staff/toolbox/tables/lccutter.htm |website=Queen Elizabeth II Libraries |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland |accessdate=14 August 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814173419/http://staff.library.mun.ca/staff/toolbox/tables/lccutter.htm |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSo to make the three digit Cutter number for \"Cutter\", you would start with \"C\", then looking under ''other consonants'', find that \"u\" gives the number 8, and under ''additional letters'', \"t\" is 8, giving a Cutter number of \"C88\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bliss, Henry Evelyn.

Later he joined ''Jaguars'', an [[Elvis Presley]] cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, joining the band ''Apa\u015flar'' (The Rowdies), his first [[Turkish language]] group. The same year, he participated in the [[Golden Microphone]] ({{lang-tr|Alt\u0131n Mikrofon}}) contest, a popular music contest in which he won second place with his song ''Emrah''. In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apa\u015flar and started an original Anatolian group called ''Karda\u015flar'' (The Brothers).\n\nIn 1972, Karaca joined the group ''[[Mo\u011follar]]'' (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, \"''Namus Belas\u0131''\". However, [[Cahit Berkay]], the leader of Mo\u011follar, wanted an international reputation for his band, and he left for [[France]] to take the group to the next level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Mo\u011follar and started his own band ''Dervi\u015fan'' (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervi\u015fan sang poetic and [[progressive rock|progressive]] songs.\n\nIn the 1970s, Turkey was dealing with political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of [[Islamism]]. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement in rebel organisations. He was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, \"Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state.\" ''Dervi\u015fan'' was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. In 1978, he founded ''Edirdahan'', an acronym for \"from [[Edirne]] to [[Ardahan]]\"; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with ''Edirdahan''.\n\nIn early 1979, he left for [[West Germany]] for business reasons, where he started singing in German language, too, namely since autumn 1980 first a lyric of [[Nazim Hikmet]] - ''K\u0131z \u00c7ocu\u011fu'' (in English: ''Little girl''): Cem performed the German verses alternating with his friend, manager, arranger and bandleader/musician ''[[Ralf M\u00e4hnh\u00f6fer]]'' attending Cem on [[grand piano]] solo or by the band ''[[Anatology]]'' singing the song in [[Turkish language]].\n\nTurkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and the [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat]] on September 12, 1980. General [[Kenan Evren]] took over the government and temporarily banned all the nation's political parties. After the coup, many intellectuals, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey.\n\nThe state invited Karaca back several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.\n\nWhile Karaca was in [[Germany]] his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1987, the [[prime minister of Turkey|prime minister]] and leader of the Turkish [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]], [[Turgut \u00d6zal]], issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album with it, ''Merhaba Gen\u00e7ler ve Her zaman Gen\u00e7 Kalanlar'' (\"''Hello, The Young and The Young at Heart''\"), one of his most influential works.

As a child, she wrote a play called ''Toyland'' which she performed to a small audience at a dinner party.\n\nFlockhart attended [[Shawnee High School (New Jersey)|Shawnee High School]] in [[Medford Township, New Jersey]]. Following graduation in 1983, Flockhart attended the [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met aspiring actress [[Jane Krakowski]], the best friend of her roommate. Later, they both would work together on ''Ally McBeal''.\n\nPeople began recognizing Flockhart's acting ability when William Esper (Mason Gross' theatre director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue usually is reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic''. Flockhart graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in Theatre in 1988 as one of the few students who successfully completed the course. Rutgers inducted her into the  Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFlockhart moved to [[New York City]] in 1989 and began seeking auditions, living with three other women in a two-bedroom apartment and working as a [[waitress]] and [[aerobics instructor]]. She would remain in the city until 1997.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nIn spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' as a babysitter.

Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie ''Darrow''. Though she later appeared in films ''[[Naked in New York]]'' (1993) and ''Getting In'' (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]].\n\nFlockhart debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1994, as Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. Actress [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] felt Flockhart should be hired without further auditions, claiming that she seemed ideal for the part.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Flockhart received a [[Clarence Derwent Award]] for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] when she appeared in the movie ''Drunks''. Later that year, Flockhart starred in ''Jane Doe'' as a drug addict. In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Gene Hackman]]'s characters in ''[[The Birdcage]]''.

Though Flockhart at first hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the role in 1998.

Also, the symmetry of {{mvar|f}} is the reason <math>f*g</math> and <math>f \\star g</math> are identical in this example.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]] (and, in particular, [[functional analysis]]) '''convolution''' is a [[operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]] on two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s (''f'' and ''g'') to produce a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.  The term ''convolution'' refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it.  Convolution is similar to [[cross-correlation]]. For discrete, real-valued functions, they differ only in a time reversal in one of the functions. For continuous functions, the cross-correlation operator is the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] of the convolution operator.\n\nIt has applications that include [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[computer vision]], [[natural language processing]], [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]], [[engineering]], and [[differential equations]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe convolution can be defined for functions on [[Euclidean space]], and other [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} For example, [[periodic function]]s, such as the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]], can be defined on a [[circle]] and convolved by ''periodic convolution''. (See row 13 at [[DTFT#Properties|DTFT &sect; Properties]].) A ''discrete convolution'' can be defined for functions on the set of [[integers]].\n\nGeneralizations of convolution have applications in the field of [[numerical analysis]] and [[numerical linear algebra]], and in the design and implementation of [[finite impulse response]] filters in signal processing.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nComputing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as [[deconvolution]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe convolution of ''f'' and ''g'' is written ''f''\u2217''g'', using an [[asterisk]] or star. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. As such, it is a particular kind of [[integral transform]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n(f * g )(t) & \\, \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) \\, d\\tau \\\\\n& = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(t-\\tau) g(\\tau)\\, d\\tau.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWhile the symbol ''t'' is used above, it need not represent the time domain. But in that context, the convolution formula can be described as a weighted average of the function ''f''(''\u03c4'') at the moment ''t'' where the weighting is given by ''g''(&minus;''\u03c4'') simply shifted by amount ''t''. As ''t'' changes, the weighting function emphasizes different parts of the input function.\n\nFor functions ''f'', ''g'' [[Support (mathematics)|supported]] on only <math>[0, \\infty)</math> (i.e., zero for negative arguments), the integration limits can be truncated, resulting in\n\n: <math>(f * g )(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau)\\, d\\tau \\text{ for } f, g : [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R} </math>\n\nIn this case, the [[Laplace transform]] is more appropriate than the [[Fourier transform]] below and boundary terms become relevant.\n\nFor the multi-dimensional formulation of convolution, see ''[[#Domain of definition|domain of definition]]'' (below).\n\n=== Notation ===\n\nA primarily engineering convention that one often sees is:<ref>\n{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Stephen W|title=The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing|date=1997|publisher=California Technical Publishing|isbn=0966017633|edition=1|url=http://www.dspguide.com/ch13/2.htm|accessdate=22 April 2016|chapter=13.Convolution}}</ref>\n\n: <math> f(t) * g(t) \\, \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\underbrace{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau)\\, d\\tau}_{(f * g )(t)},</math>\n\nwhich has to be interpreted carefully to avoid confusion. For instance, ''&fnof;''(''t'') * ''g''(''t'' \u2212 ''t''<sub>0</sub>) is equivalent to (''&fnof;''* ''g'')(''t'' \u2212 ''t''<sub>0</sub>), but ''&fnof;''(''t'' \u2212 ''t''<sub>0</sub>)* ''g''(''t'' \u2212 ''t''<sub>0</sub>) is in fact equivalent to (''&fnof;'' * ''g'')(''t'' \u2212 2''t''<sub>0</sub>).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=J.

See [[LTI system theory#Overview|LTI system theory]] for a derivation of convolution as the result of LTI constraints. In terms of the [[Fourier transforms]] of the input and output of an LTI operation, no new frequency components are created. The existing ones are only modified (amplitude and/or phase). In other words, the output transform is the pointwise product of the input transform with a third transform (known as a [[transfer function]]). See [[Convolution theorem]] for a derivation of that property of convolution. Conversely, convolution can be derived as the inverse Fourier transform of the pointwise product of two Fourier transforms.\n\n== Visual explanation ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 |'''Visual explanations of convolution'''<br />\n|-\n|\n# Express each function in terms of a [[Free variables and bound variables|dummy variable]] <math>\\tau.</math>\n# Reflect one of the functions: <math>g(\\tau)</math>\u2192<math>g(-\\tau).</math>\n# Add a time-offset, ''t'', which allows <math>g(t-\\tau)</math> to slide along the <math>\\tau</math>-axis.\n# Start ''t'' at \u2212\u221e and slide it all the way to +\u221e.

The term itself did not come into wide use until the 1950s or 60s. Prior to that it was sometimes known as ''Faltung'' (which means ''folding'' in [[German language|German]]), ''composition product'', ''superposition integral'', and ''Carson's integral''.<ref>\n{{Citation\n | chapter = Early work on imaging theory in radio astronomy\n | author = R.

When the sequences are the coefficients of two [[polynomial]]s, then the coefficients of the ordinary product of the two polynomials are the convolution of the original two sequences. This is known as the [[Cauchy product]] of the coefficients of the sequences.\n\nThus when ''g'' has finite support in the set <math>\\{-M,-M+1,\\dots,M-1,M\\}</math> (representing, for instance, a [[finite impulse response]]), a finite summation may be used:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Press |first1=William H. |last2=Flannery |first2=Brian P.|last3=Teukolsky |first3=Saul A. |last4=Vetterling |first4=William T. |title= Numerical Recipes in Pascal|edition= |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37516-9|page=450}}</ref>\n:<math>(f* g)[n]=\\sum_{m=-M}^M f[n-m]g[m].</math>\n\n=== Circular discrete convolution ===\nWhen a function ''g<sub>N</sub>'' is periodic, with period ''N'', then for functions, ''f'', such that ''f''\u2217''g<sub>N</sub>'' exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:\n\n:<math>(f * g_N)[n] \\equiv \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty {f}[m+kN] \\right) g_N[n-m].</math>\n\nThe summation on ''k'' is called a [[periodic summation]] of the function ''f''.\n\nIf ''g<sub>N</sub>'' is a periodic summation of another function, ''g'', then ''f''\u2217''g<sub>N</sub>'' is known as a [[circular convolution]] of ''f'' and ''g''.\n\nWhen the non-zero durations of both ''f'' and ''g'' are limited to the interval [0, ''N'' \u2212 1], ''f''\u2217''g<sub>N</sub>'' reduces to these common forms:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\begin{align}\n(f * g_N)[n] &= \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} f[m]g_N[n-m]\\\\\n &= \\sum_{m=0}^n f[m]g[n-m] + \\sum_{m=n+1}^{N-1} f[m]g[N+n-m]\\\\\n &= \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} f[m]g[(n-m)_{\\bmod{N}}] \\equiv (f * _N g)[n]\n\\end{align}</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n\nThe notation (''f'' \u2217<sub>''N''</sub> ''g'') for ''cyclic convolution'' denotes convolution over the [[cyclic group]] of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''N'']].\n\nCircular convolution arises most often in the context of fast convolution with a [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm.\n\n===Fast convolution algorithms===\n\nIn many situations, discrete convolutions can be converted to circular convolutions so that fast transforms with a convolution property can be used to implement the computation. For example, convolution of digit sequences is the kernel operation in [[multiplication]] of multi-digit numbers, which can therefore be efficiently implemented with transform techniques ({{harvnb|Knuth|1997|loc=\u00a74.3.3.C}}; {{harvnb|von zur Gathen|Gerhard|2003|loc=\u00a78.2}}).\n\n{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} requires ''N'' arithmetic operations per output value and ''N''<sup>2</sup> operations for ''N'' outputs. That can be significantly reduced with any of several fast algorithms. [[Digital signal processing]] and other applications typically use fast convolution algorithms to reduce the cost of the convolution to O(''N'' log ''N'') complexity.\n\nThe most common fast convolution algorithms use [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms via the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]]. Specifically, the [[circular convolution]] of two finite-length sequences is found by taking an FFT of each sequence, multiplying pointwise, and then performing an inverse FFT. Convolutions of the type defined above are then efficiently implemented using that technique in conjunction with zero-extension and/or discarding portions of the output.

Conditions for the existence of the convolution may be tricky, since a blow-up in ''g'' at infinity can be easily offset by sufficiently rapid decay in ''f''. The question of existence thus may involve different conditions on ''f'' and ''g'':\n\n===Compactly supported functions===\nIf ''f'' and ''g'' are [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[continuous function]]s, then their convolution exists, and is also compactly supported and continuous {{harv|H\u00f6rmander|1983|loc=Chapter 1}}. More generally, if either function (say ''f'') is compactly supported and the other is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]], then the convolution ''f''\u2217''g'' is well-defined and continuous.\n\nConvolution of ''f'' and ''g'' is also well defined when both functions are locally square integrable on '''R''' and supported on an interval of the form [a, +&infin;) (or both supported on [-&infin;, a]).\n\n===Integrable functions===\nThe convolution of ''f'' and ''g'' exists if ''f'' and ''g'' are both [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable functions]] in [[Lp space|L<sup>1</sup>('''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>)]], and in this case ''f''\u2217''g'' is also integrable {{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=Theorem 1.3}}. This is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem#Tonelli's theorem|Tonelli's theorem]]. This is also true for functions in <math>\\ell^1</math>, under the discrete convolution, or more generally for the [[#Convolutions on groups|convolution on any group]].\n\nLikewise, if ''f'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>) and ''g'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>) where 1 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 \u221e, then ''f''\u2217''g'' \u2208 ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>) and\n\n:<math>\\|{f}* g\\|_p\\le \\|f\\|_1\\|g\\|_p.</math>\n\nIn the particular case ''p'' = 1, this shows that ''L''<sup>1</sup> is a [[Banach algebra]] under the convolution (and equality of the two sides holds if ''f'' and ''g'' are non-negative almost everywhere).\n \nMore generally, [[Young's convolution inequality|Young's inequality]] implies that the convolution is a continuous bilinear map between suitable ''L''<sup>''p''</sup> spaces. Specifically, if 1 \u2264 ''p'',''q'',''r'' \u2264 \u221e satisfy\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=\\frac{1}{r}+1,</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert f* g\\right\\Vert _{r}\\le\\left\\Vert f\\right\\Vert _{p}\\left\\Vert g\\right\\Vert _{q},\\quad f\\in\\mathcal{L}^{p},\\ g\\in\\mathcal{L}^{q},</math>\n\nso that the convolution is a continuous bilinear mapping from ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>&times;''L''<sup>''q''</sup> to ''L''<sup>''r''</sup>.\nThe Young inequality for convolution is also true in other contexts (circle group, convolution on '''Z'''). The preceding inequality is not sharp on the real line: when {{nowrap| 1 &lt; ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' &lt; &infin;}}, there exists a constant {{nowrap|''B''<sub>''p'', ''q''</sub> &lt; 1}} such that:\n\n:<math>\\left\\Vert f* g\\right\\Vert _{r}\\le B_{p,q}\\left\\Vert f\\right\\Vert _{p}\\left\\Vert g\\right\\Vert _{q},\\quad f\\in\\mathcal{L}^{p},\\ g\\in\\mathcal{L}^{q}.</math>\n\nThe optimal value of {{nowrap|''B''<sub>''p'', ''q''</sub>}} was discovered in 1975.<ref>\n[[William Beckner (mathematician)|Beckner, William]] (1975), \"Inequalities in Fourier analysis\", Ann. of Math.

An important feature of the convolution is that if ''f'' and ''g'' both decay rapidly, then ''f''\u2217''g'' also decays rapidly. In particular, if ''f'' and ''g'' are [[rapidly decreasing function]]s, then so is the convolution ''f''\u2217''g''. Combined with the fact that convolution commutes with differentiation (see '''Properties'''), it follows that the class of [[Schwartz function]]s is closed under convolution {{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=Theorem 3.3}}.\n\n===Distributions===\n{{Main article|Distribution (mathematics)}}\nUnder some circumstances, it is possible to define the convolution of a function with a distribution, or of two distributions. If ''f'' is a compactly supported function and ''g'' is a distribution, then ''f''\u2217''g'' is a smooth function defined by a distributional formula analogous to\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d} {f}(y)g(x-y)\\,dy.</math>\n\nMore generally, it is possible to extend the definition of the convolution in a unique way so that the associative law\n\n:<math>f* (g* \\varphi) = (f* g)* \\varphi</math>\n\nremains valid in the case where ''f'' is a distribution, and ''g'' a compactly supported distribution {{harv|H\u00f6rmander|1983|loc=\u00a74.2}}.\n\n===Measures===\n\nThe convolution of any two [[Borel measure]]s \u03bc and \u03bd of [[bounded variation]] is the measure \u03bb defined by {{harv|Rudin|1962}}\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d} f(x)d\\lambda(x) = \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d}\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d}f(x+y)\\,d\\mu(x)\\,d\\nu(y).</math>\nThis agrees with the convolution defined above when \u03bc and \u03bd are regarded as distributions, as well as the convolution of L<sup>1</sup> functions when \u03bc and \u03bd are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe convolution of measures also satisfies the following version of Young's inequality\n:<math>\\|\\mu* \\nu\\|\\le \\|\\mu\\|\\|\\nu\\| </math>\nwhere the norm is the [[total variation]] of a measure. Because the space of measures of bounded variation is a [[Banach space]], convolution of measures can be treated with standard methods of [[functional analysis]] that may not apply for the convolution of distributions.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Algebraic properties===\n{{See also|Convolution algebra}}\nThe convolution defines a product on the [[linear space]] of integrable functions. This product satisfies the following algebraic properties, which formally mean that the space of integrable functions with the product given by convolution is a commutative [[associative algebra]] without [[identity element|identity]] {{harv|Strichartz|1994|loc=\u00a73.3}}. Other linear spaces of functions, such as the space of continuous functions of compact support, are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the convolution, and so also form commutative associative algebras.\n\n;[[Commutativity]]\n: <math>f * g = g * f </math>\n\n'''Proof:''' By definition\n: <math>f * g = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau</math>\nChanging the variable of integration to <math>u=t-\\tau</math> and the result follows.\n\n;[[Associativity]]\n: <math>f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h </math>\n\n'''Proof:''' This follows from using [[Fubini's theorem]] (i.e., double integrals can be evaluated as\niterated integrals in either order).\n\n;[[Distributivity]]\n: <math>f * (g + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)</math>\n'''Proof:''' This follows from linearity of the integral.\n\n;Associativity with scalar multiplication\n: <math>a (f * g) = (a f) * g</math>\nfor any real (or complex) number <math>a</math>.\n\n;[[Multiplicative identity]]\nNo algebra of functions possesses an identity for the convolution. The lack of identity is typically not a major inconvenience, since most collections of functions on which the convolution is performed can be convolved with a [[Dirac delta|delta distribution]] or, at the very least (as is the case of ''L''<sup>1</sup>) admit [[Nascent delta function|approximations to the identity]]. The linear space of compactly supported distributions does, however, admit an identity under the convolution. Specifically,\n:<math>f* \\delta = f</math>\nwhere ''\u03b4'' is the delta distribution.\n\n;Inverse element\n\nSome distributions have an [[inverse element]] for the convolution, ''S''<sup>(&minus;1)</sup>, which is defined by\n: <math>S^{(-1)} * S = \\delta.</math>\nThe set of invertible distributions forms an [[abelian group]] under the convolution.\n\n;Complex conjugation\n\n: <math>\\overline{f * g} = \\overline{f} * \\overline{g}</math>\n\n;Relationship with differentiation\n\n: <math>(f* g)'=f'* g=f* g'</math>\n\n'''Proof:'''\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n(f* g)' & = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} f(\\tau) g(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau \\\\[4pt]\n& =\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty} f(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} g(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau \\\\[4pt]\n& =\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} f(\\tau) g'(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau= f* g'.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n;Relationship with integration\n:If <math>F(t)=\\int^t_{-\\infty} f(\\tau) d\\tau,</math> and <math>G(t)=\\int^t_{-\\infty} g(\\tau) \\, d\\tau,</math> then\n:<math>(F* g)(t)=(f* G)(t)=\\int^t_{-\\infty}(f* g)(\\tau)\\,d\\tau.</math>\n\n===Integration===\nIf ''f'' and ''g'' are integrable functions, then the integral of their convolution on the whole space is simply obtained as the product of their integrals:\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d}(f* g)(x) \\, dx=\\left(\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d}f(x) \\, dx\\right) \\left(\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^d}g(x) \\, dx\\right).</math>\n\nThis follows from [[Fubini's theorem]]. The same result holds if ''f'' and ''g'' are only assumed to be nonnegative measurable functions, by [[Fubini's theorem#Tonelli's theorem|Tonelli's theorem]].\n\n===Differentiation===\nIn the one-variable case,\n\n: <math>\\frac{d}{dx}(f * g) = \\frac{df}{dx} * g = f * \\frac{dg}{dx}</math>\n\nwhere ''d''/''dx'' is the [[derivative]]. More generally, in the case of functions of several variables, an analogous formula holds with the [[partial derivative]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}(f * g) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} * g = f * \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_i}.</math>\n\nA particular consequence of this is that the convolution can be viewed as a \"smoothing\" operation: the convolution of ''f'' and ''g'' is differentiable as many times as ''f'' and ''g'' are in total.\n\nThese identities hold under the precise condition that ''f'' and ''g'' are absolutely integrable and at least one of them has an absolutely integrable (L<sup>1</sup>) weak derivative, as a consequence of [[Young's convolution inequality]]. For instance, when ''f'' is continuously differentiable with compact support, and ''g'' is an arbitrary locally integrable function,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}(f * g) = \\frac{df}{dx} * g.</math>\n\nThese identities also hold much more broadly in the sense of tempered distributions if one of ''f'' or ''g'' is a compactly supported distribution or a Schwartz function and the other is a tempered distribution. On the other hand, two positive integrable and infinitely differentiable functions may have a nowhere continuous convolution.\n\nIn the discrete case, the [[difference operator]] ''D'' ''f''(''n'') = ''f''(''n'' + 1) &minus; ''f''(''n'') satisfies an analogous relationship:\n\n:<math>D(f* g) = (Df)* g = f* (Dg).</math>\n\n===Convolution theorem===\nThe [[convolution theorem]] states that\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{F}\\{f * g\\} = k\\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}\\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\}</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}</math> denotes the [[Fourier transform]] of <math>f</math>, and <math>k</math> is a constant that depends on the specific [[Normalizing constant|normalization]] of the Fourier transform. Versions of this theorem also hold for the [[Laplace transform]], [[two-sided Laplace transform]], [[Z-transform]] and [[Mellin transform]].\n\nSee also the less trivial [[Titchmarsh convolution theorem]].\n\n===Translational equivariance===\nThe convolution commutes with translations, meaning that\n\n:<math>\\tau_x (f * g) = (\\tau_x f)* g = {f}* (\\tau_x g)</math>\n\nwhere \u03c4<sub>''x''</sub>f is the translation of the function ''f'' by ''x'' defined by\n\n:<math>(\\tau_x f)(y) = f(y-x).</math>\n\nIf ''f'' is a [[Schwartz function]], then \u03c4<sub>''x''</sub>''f'' is the convolution with a translated Dirac delta function ''\u03c4''<sub>''x''</sub>''f'' = ''f'' \u2217 ''\u03c4''<sub>''x''</sub> ''\u03b4''. So translation invariance of the convolution of Schwartz functions is a consequence of the associativity of convolution.\n\nFurthermore, under certain conditions, convolution is the most general translation invariant operation. Informally speaking, the following holds\n\n* Suppose that ''S'' is a bounded [[linear operator]] acting on functions which commutes with translations: ''S''(\u03c4<sub>''x''</sub>''f'') = \u03c4<sub>''x''</sub>(''Sf'') for all ''x''. Then ''S'' is given as convolution with a function (or distribution) ''g''<sub>''S''</sub>; that is ''Sf'' = ''g''<sub>''S''</sub> \u2217 ''f''.\n\nThus some translation invariant operations can be represented as convolution. Convolutions play an important role in the study of [[time-invariant system]]s, and especially [[LTI system theory]]. The representing function ''g''<sub>''S''</sub> is the [[impulse response]] of the transformation ''S''.\n\nA more precise version of the theorem quoted above requires specifying the class of functions on which the convolution is defined, and also requires assuming in addition that ''S'' must be a [[continuous linear operator]] with respect to the appropriate [[topology]]. It is known, for instance, that every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on ''L''<sup>1</sup> is the convolution with a finite [[Borel measure]]. More generally, every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on ''L''<sup>''p''</sup> for 1 \u2264 ''p'' < \u221e is the convolution with a [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]] whose [[Fourier transform]] is bounded. To wit, they are all given by bounded [[Fourier multiplier]]s.\n\n==Convolutions on groups==\nIf ''G'' is a suitable [[group (mathematics)|group]] endowed with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] \u03bb, and if ''f'' and ''g'' are real or complex valued [[Lebesgue integral|integrable]] functions on ''G'', then we can define their convolution by\n\n:<math>(f * g)(x) = \\int_G f(y) g(y^{-1}x)\\,d\\lambda(y).</math>\n\nIt is not commutative in general. In typical cases of interest ''G'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] and \u03bb is a (left-) [[Haar measure]]. In that case, unless ''G'' is [[unimodular group|unimodular]], the convolution defined in this way is not the same as <math>\\textstyle{\\int f(xy^{-1})g(y) \\, d\\lambda(y)}</math>. The preference of one over the other is made so that convolution with a fixed function ''g'' commutes with left translation in the group:\n\n:<math>L_h(f* g) = (L_hf)* g.</math>\n\nFurthermore, the convention is also required for consistency with the definition of the convolution of measures given below. However, with a right instead of a left Haar measure, the latter integral is preferred over the former.\n\nOn locally compact [[abelian group]]s, a version of the [[convolution theorem]] holds: the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of the Fourier transforms. The [[circle group]] '''T''' with the Lebesgue measure is an immediate example. For a fixed ''g'' in ''L''<sup>1</sup>('''T'''), we have the following familiar operator acting on the [[Hilbert space]] ''L''<sup>2</sup>('''T'''):\n\n:<math>T {f}(x) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{\\mathbf{T}} {f}(y) g( x - y) \\, dy.</math>\n\nThe operator ''T'' is [[compact operator on Hilbert space|compact]]. A direct calculation shows that its adjoint ''T* '' is convolution with\n\n:<math>\\bar{g}(-y).</math>\n\nBy the commutativity property cited above, ''T'' is [[normal operator|normal]]: ''T''* ''T'' = ''TT''* . Also, ''T'' commutes with the translation operators. Consider the family ''S'' of operators consisting of all such convolutions and the translation operators. Then ''S'' is a commuting family of normal operators. According to [[compact operator on Hilbert space|spectral theory]], there exists an orthonormal basis {''h<sub>k</sub>''} that simultaneously diagonalizes ''S''. This characterizes convolutions on the circle. Specifically, we have\n\n:<math>h_k (x) = e^{ikx}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\;</math>\n\nwhich are precisely the [[Character (mathematics)|character]]s of '''T'''. Each convolution is a compact [[multiplication operator]] in this basis. This can be viewed as a version of the convolution theorem discussed above.\n\nA discrete example is a finite [[cyclic group]] of order ''n''. Convolution operators are here represented by [[circulant matrices]], and can be diagonalized by the [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\nA similar result holds for compact groups (not necessarily abelian): the matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional [[unitary representation]]s form an orthonormal basis in ''L''<sup>2</sup> by the [[Peter\u2013Weyl theorem]], and an analog of the convolution theorem continues to hold, along with many other aspects of [[harmonic analysis]] that depend on the Fourier transform.\n\n==Convolution of measures==\nLet ''G'' be a (multiplicatively written) topological group.\nIf \u03bc and \u03bd are finite [[Borel measure]]s on ''G'', then their convolution \u03bc\u2217\u03bd is defined as the [[pushforward measure]] of the [[group action]] and can be written as\n<!--\n\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EDITING:\n\nGroups are written multiplicatively, so please don't change this from multiplication in the group to \"+\".\n\n:<math>(\\mu * \\nu)(E) = \\iint 1_E(xy) \\,d\\mu(x) \\,d\\nu(y)</math>\n\n-->:<math>(\\mu * \\nu)(E) = \\iint 1_E(xy) \\,d\\mu(x) \\,d\\nu(y)</math>\n\nfor each measurable subset ''E'' of ''G''. The convolution is also a finite measure, whose [[total variation]] satisfies\n:<math>\\|\\mu * \\nu\\| \\le \\|\\mu\\| \\|\\nu\\|.</math>\n\nIn the case when ''G'' is [[locally compact]] with (left-)[[Haar measure]] \u03bb, and \u03bc and \u03bd are [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to a \u03bb, [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem|so that each has a density function]], then the convolution \u03bc\u2217\u03bd is also absolutely continuous, and its density function is just the convolution of the two separate density functions.\n\nIf \u03bc and \u03bd are [[probability measure]]s on the topological group {{nowrap|('''R''',+),}} then the convolution \u03bc\u2217\u03bd is the [[probability distribution]] of the sum ''X'' + ''Y'' of two [[statistical independence|independent]] [[random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' whose respective distributions are \u03bc and \u03bd.\n\n==Bialgebras==\nLet (''X'', \u0394, \u2207, ''\u03b5'', ''\u03b7'') be a [[bialgebra]] with comultiplication \u0394, multiplication \u2207, unit \u03b7, and counit \u03b5. The convolution is a product defined on the [[endomorphism algebra]] End(''X'') as follows. Let \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 End(''X''), that is, \u03c6,\u03c8 : ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' are functions that respect all algebraic structure of ''X'', then the convolution \u03c6\u2217\u03c8 is defined as the composition\n\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} X\\otimes X \\xrightarrow{\\phi\\otimes\\psi} X\\otimes X \\xrightarrow{\\nabla} X.</math>\n\nThe convolution appears notably in the definition of [[Hopf algebra]]s {{harv|Kassel|1995|loc=\u00a7III.3}}.

The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues, and [[Chintz|calico prints]] became popular in [[Europe]].\n\n==History==\nCalico originated in [[Calicut]], (from which the name of the textile came) in southwestern India (in present-day [[Kerala]]) during the 11th century.<ref name=eb-calico/> The cloth was known as \"c\u0101liyan\" to the natives.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jill |last=Condra|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History: 1801 to the Present|volume= 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6FI2czFz6MC&dq=calico+calicut&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>\n\nIt was mentioned in Indian literature by the 12th century when the writer [[Acharya Hemachandra|H\u0113macandra]] described calico fabric prints with a lotus design.<ref name=eb-calico>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2008).

That industry, centred in the east and south in towns such as [[Norwich]], jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only {{convert|1,985,868|lb|kg}} of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to {{convert|1,545,472|lb|kg}}. This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry.<ref name=E296>{{Harvnb|Espinasse|1874|p=296}}</ref> Cheap [[Chintz|calico prints]], imported by the [[East India Company]] from [[Hindustan|Hindust\u0101n (India)]], had become popular. In 1700 an [[Act of Parliament]]<!--Act 11 William III--> passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead\u2014calico that had not been finished\u2014dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England{{who|date=June 2016}}. Also, [[Lancashire]] businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as [[fustian]], which they sent to London for finishing.<ref name=E296/> Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers, in true [[Protectionism|protectionist]] fashion, claimed that the imports were taking jobs away <!--  why is it artificial? --> from workers in [[Coventry]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Espinasse|1874|p=298}}</ref> A new [[7 George 3 cap 7|law]] passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins. Neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton [[weft]] with [[linen]] warp were specifically permitted by the [[1736 Manchester Act]].

Early European calicoes (1680) would be cheap plain-weave white cotton fabric with equal weft and warp plain weave cotton fabric in, or cream or unbleached cotton, with a design block-printed using a single [[Rose madder|alizarin dye]] fixed with two mordants, giving a red and black pattern. Polychromatic prints were possible, using two sets of blocks and an additional blue dye.

Calorimetry is performed with a [[calorimeter]]. The word ''calorimetry'' is derived from the Latin word ''calor'', meaning heat and the Greek word ''\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd'' (metron), meaning measure.  Scottish physician and scientist [[Joseph Black]], who was the first to recognize the distinction between [[heat]] and [[temperature]], is said to be the founder of the science of calorimetry.<ref name=\"Laider\" >{{cite book|last=Laidler |first=Keith, J. |author-link=Keith J. Laidler |title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-19-855919-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Indirect calorimetry]] calculates [[heat]] that living organisms produce by measuring either their production of [[carbon dioxide]] and nitrogen waste (frequently [[ammonia]] in aquatic organisms, or [[urea]] in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of [[oxygen]]. \n[[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption this way, using [[multiple regression]]. The [[dynamic energy budget]] theory explains why this procedure is correct. Heat generated by living organisms may also be measured by ''direct calorimetry'', in which the entire organism is placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement.\n\nA widely used modern instrument is the [[differential scanning calorimeter]], a device which allows thermal data to be obtained on small amounts of material. It involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and recording the heat flow either into or from the specimen.\n\n==Classical calorimetric calculation of heat==\n\n===Cases with differentiable equation of state for a one-component body===\n\n====Basic classical calculation with respect to volume====\n\nCalorimetry requires that a reference material that changes temperature have known definite thermal constitutive properties. The classical rule, recognized by [[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius]] and by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]], is that the pressure exerted by the calorimetric material is fully and rapidly determined solely by its temperature and volume; this rule is for changes that do not involve phase change, such as melting of ice. There are many materials that do not comply with this rule, and for them, the present formula of classical calorimetry does not provide an adequate account. Here the classical rule is assumed to hold for the calorimetric material being used, and the propositions are mathematically written:\n\nThe thermal response of the calorimetric material is fully described by its pressure <math>p\\ </math> as the value of its constitutive function <math>p(V,T)\\ </math> of just the volume <math>V\\ </math> and the temperature <math>T\\ </math>. All increments are here required to be very small. This calculation refers to a domain of volume and temperature of the body in which no phase change occurs, and there is only one phase present. An important assumption here is continuity of property relations. A different analysis is needed for phase change\n\nWhen a small increment of heat is gained by a calorimetric body, with small increments, <math>\\delta V\\ </math> of its volume, and <math>\\delta T\\ </math> of its temperature, the increment of heat, <math>\\delta Q\\ </math>, gained by the body of calorimetric material, is given by\n\n:<math>\\delta Q\\ =C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\\, \\delta V\\,+\\,C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\\,\\delta T</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\\ </math> denotes the latent heat with respect to volume, of the calorimetric material at constant controlled temperature <math>T</math>. The surroundings' pressure on the material is instrumentally adjusted to impose a chosen volume change, with initial volume <math>V\\ </math>. To determine this latent heat, the volume change is effectively the independently instrumentally varied quantity. This latent heat is not one of the widely used ones, but is of theoretical or conceptual interest.\n:<math>C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\\ </math> denotes the heat capacity, of the calorimetric material at fixed constant volume <math>V\\ </math>, while the pressure of the material is allowed to vary freely, with initial temperature <math>T\\ </math>. The temperature is forced to change by exposure to a suitable heat bath.

For all of these usages of 'latent heat', a more systematic terminology uses 'latent heat capacity'.\n\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is the heat required for unit increment in temperature at constant volume. It can be said to be 'measured along an isochor', and again, the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. It always has a positive sign. This means that for an increase in the temperature of a body without change of its volume, heat must be supplied to it. This is consistent with common experience.\n\nQuantities like <math>\\delta Q\\ </math> are sometimes called 'curve differentials', because they are measured along curves in the <math>(V,T)\\ </math> surface.\n\n====Classical theory for constant-volume calorimetry====\nConstant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant [[volume]]. This involves the use of a [[constant-volume calorimeter]].

It worked at constant temperature, and at atmospheric pressure. The latent heat involved was then not a latent heat with respect to volume or with respect to pressure, as in the above account for calorimetry without phase change. The latent heat involved in this calorimeter was with respect to phase change, naturally occurring at constant temperature. This kind of calorimeter worked by measurement of mass of water produced by the melting of ice, which is a [[phase transition|phase change]].\n\n===Cumulation of heating===\n\nFor a time-dependent process of heating of the calorimetric material, defined by a continuous joint progression <math>P(t_1,t_2)\\ </math> of <math>V(t)\\ </math> and <math>T(t)\\ </math>, starting at time <math>t_1\\ </math> and ending at time <math>t_2\\ </math>, there can be calculated an accumulated quantity of heat delivered, <math>\\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\\, </math> . This calculation is done by [[line integral|mathematical integration along the progression]] with respect to time. This is because increments of heat are 'additive'; but this does not mean that heat is a conservative quantity. The idea that heat was a conservative quantity was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], and is called the '[[caloric theory]]'; by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as mistaken. Written with the symbol <math>\\Delta\\ </math>, the quantity <math>\\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\\, </math> is not at all restricted to be an increment with very small values; this is in contrast with <math>\\delta Q\\ </math>.\n\nOne can write\n\n:<math>\\Delta Q(P(t_1,t_2))\\ </math>\n\n::<math>=\\int_{P(t_1,t_2)} \\dot Q(t)dt</math>\n\n::<math>=\\int_{P(t_1,t_2)} C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\\, \\dot V(t)\\, dt\\,+\\,\\int_{P(t_1,t_2)}C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\\,\\dot T(t)\\,dt </math>.\n\nThis expression uses quantities such as <math>\\dot Q(t)\\ </math> which are defined in the section below headed 'Mathematical aspects of the above rules'.\n\n===Mathematical aspects of the above rules===\n\nThe use of 'very small' quantities such as <math>\\delta Q\\ </math> is related to the physical requirement for the quantity <math>p(V,T)\\ </math> to be 'rapidly determined' by <math>V\\ </math> and <math>T\\ </math>; such 'rapid determination' refers to a physical process. These 'very small' quantities are used in the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] approach to the [[Calculus|infinitesimal calculus]]. The [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] approach uses instead '[[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]' such as <math>\\dot V(t) = \\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_t</math>, which makes it more obvious that <math>p(V,T)\\ </math> must be 'rapidly determined'.\n\nIn terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be written<ref>Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 20.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\dot Q(t)\\ =C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\\, \\dot V(t)\\,+\\,C^{(T)}_V(V,T)\\,\\dot T(t)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>t\\ </math> denotes the time\n\n:<math>\\dot Q(t)\\ </math> denotes the time rate of heating of the calorimetric material at time <math>t\\ </math>\n\n:<math>\\dot V(t)\\ </math> denotes the time rate of change of volume of the calorimetric material at time <math>t\\ </math>\n\n:<math>\\dot T(t)\\ </math> denotes the time rate of change of temperature of the calorimetric material.\n\nThe increment <math>\\delta Q\\ </math> and the fluxion <math>\\dot Q(t)\\ </math> are obtained for a particular time <math>t\\ </math> that determines the values of the quantities on the righthand sides of the above rules. But this is not a reason to expect that there should exist a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] <math>Q(V,T)\\ </math>. For this reason, the increment <math>\\delta Q\\ </math> is said to be an 'imperfect differential' or an '[[inexact differential]]'.<ref name=\"Adkins 1975 16\">Adkins, C.J.

It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a [[Carnot cycle]].\n\nA Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:\n\n(1) a change in volume from a volume <math>V_a\\ </math> to a volume <math>V_b\\ </math> at constant temperature <math>T^+\\ </math> so as to incur a flow of heat into the body (known as an isothermal change)\n\n(2) a change in volume from <math>V_b\\ </math> to a volume <math>V_c\\ </math> at a variable temperature just such as to incur no flow of heat (known as an adiabatic change)\n\n(3) another isothermal change in volume from <math>V_c\\ </math> to a volume <math>V_d\\ </math> at constant temperature <math>T^-\\ </math> such as to incur a flow or heat out of the body and just such as to precisely prepare for the following change\n\n(4) another adiabatic change of volume from <math>V_d\\ </math> back to <math>V_a\\ </math> just such as to return the body to its starting temperature <math>T^+\\ </math>.\n\nIn isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by\n\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+)\\,=\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\int_{V_a}^{V_b} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^+)\\, dV\\ </math>\n\nand in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by\n\n:<math>-\\Delta Q(V_c,V_d;T^-)\\,=\\,-\\int_{V_c}^{V_d} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^-)\\, dV\\ </math>.<ref>Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), pages 52-53.</ref>\n\nBecause the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by\n\n:<math>\\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+;V_c,V_d;T^-)\\,=\\,\\Delta Q(V_a,V_b;T^+)\\,+\\,\\Delta Q(V_c,V_d;T^-)\\,=\\,\\int_{V_a}^{V_b} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^+)\\, dV\\,+\\,\\int_{V_c}^{V_d} C^{(V)}_T(V,T^-)\\, dV\\ </math>.\n\nThis quantity is used by thermodynamics and is related in a special way to the net [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the body during the Carnot cycle. The net change of the body's internal energy during the Carnot cycle, <math>\\Delta U(V_a,V_b;T^+;V_c,V_d;T^-)\\ </math>, is equal to zero, because the material of the working body has the special properties noted above.\n\n==Special interest of calorimetry in thermodynamics: relations between classical calorimetric quantities==\n\n===Relation of latent heat with respect to volume, and the equation of state===\n\nThe quantity <math>C^{(V)}_T(V,T)\\ </math>, the latent heat with respect to volume, belongs to classical calorimetry. It accounts for the occurrence of energy transfer by work in a process in which heat is also transferred; the quantity, however, was considered before the relation between heat and work transfers was clarified by the invention of thermodynamics. In the light of thermodynamics, the classical calorimetric quantity is revealed as being tightly linked to the calorimetric material's equation of state <math>p=p(V,T)\\ </math>. Provided that the temperature <math>T\\, </math> is measured in the thermodynamic absolute scale, the relation is expressed in the formula\n\n:<math>C^{(V)}_T(V,T)=T \\left.\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}\\right|_{(V,T)}\\ </math>.<ref>Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S.

This involves the use of a [[constant-volume calorimeter]].\n\nNo work is performed in constant-volume calorimetry, so the heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system. The heat capacity at constant volume is assumed to be independent of temperature.\n\nHeat is measured by the principle of calorimetry.\n\n:<math>q = C_V \\Delta T = \\Delta U \\,,</math>\n\nwhere \n\n:\u0394''U'' is change in [[internal energy]],\n:\u0394''T'' is change in [[temperature]] and\n:''C<sub>V</sub>'' is the [[heat capacity]] at constant volume.\nIn ''constant-volume calorimetry'' the [[pressure]] is not held constant. If there is a pressure difference between initial and final states, the heat measured needs adjustment to provide the ''[[enthalpy]] change''.

He was also the [[List of Governors of New York|36th Governor of New York]], the Republican presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916 presidential election]], and the 44th [[United States Secretary of State]].\n\nBorn to a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigrant preacher and his wife in [[Glens Falls, New York]], Hughes pursued a legal career in [[New York City]]. After working in private practice for several years, in 1905 he led successful state investigations into public utilities and the life insurance industry. He won election as the Governor of New York in 1906 and implemented several [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] reforms. In 1910, President [[William Howard Taft]] appointed Hughes as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Hughes often joined Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] in voting to uphold state and federal regulations.\n\nHughes served as an Associate Justice until 1916, when he resigned from the bench to accept the Republican presidential nomination. Though Hughes was widely viewed as the favorite in the race against incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Wilson won a narrow victory. After [[Warren G. Harding]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], Hughes accepted Harding's offer to serve as Secretary of State. Serving under Harding and [[Calvin Coolidge]], Hughes negotiated the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which was designed to prevent a naval arms race among the United States, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Hughes left office in 1925 and returned to private practice, becoming one of the most prominent attorneys in the country.\n\nIn 1930, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Hughes to succeed Chief Justice Taft. Along with Associate Justice [[Owen Roberts]], Hughes emerged as a key swing vote on the bench, positioned between the liberal [[Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|Three Musketeers]] and the conservative [[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|Four Horsemen]]. The [[Hughes Court]] struck down several [[New Deal]] programs in the early- and mid-1930s, but 1937 marked a turning point for the Supreme Court and the New Deal as Hughes and Roberts joined with the Three Musketeers to uphold the Wagner Act and a state minimum wage law. That same year saw the defeat of the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. Hughes served until 1941, when he retired and was succeeded by Associate Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]].\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[Image:Charles Evans Hughes, age 16.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Evans Hughes, age 16]]\n\nHughes's father, David Charles Hughes, migrated from [[Wales]] to the United States in 1855 after he was inspired by the autobiography of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. David became a [[Baptists|Baptist]] preacher in [[Glens Falls, New York]], and married Mary Catherine Connelly, whose family had been in the United States for several generations.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=9\u201311}}</ref> Charles Evans Hughes, the only child of David and Mary, was born in Glens Falls on April 11, 1862.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hughes, Charles Evans |url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/hughes-charles-evans |website=Federal Judicial Center |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref> The Hughes family moved to [[Oswego, New York]] in 1866, but relocated soon after to [[Newark, New Jersey]] and then to [[Brooklyn]]. With the exception of a brief period of attendance at Newark High School, Hughes received no formal education until 1874, instead being educated by his parents. In September 1874, he enrolled in New York City's prestigious Public School 35, graduating the following year.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> \n\nAt the age of 14, he enrolled at Madison University (now [[Colgate University]]), then transferred to [[Brown University]]. He graduated third in his class at the age of 19, having been elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in his junior year.<ref name=\"ross2\"/> During his time at Brown, Hughes volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[James A. Garfield]] and served as the editor of the college newspaper. After graduating from Brown, Hughes spent a year working as a teacher in [[Delhi, New York]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hughes next enrolled in [[Columbia Law School]], graduating with highest honors.<ref name=\"ross2\">{{harvnb|Ross|2007|p=2}}</ref> He passed the New York bar exam in 1884 with the highest score ever awarded by the state.<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|pp=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Hughes married Antoinette Carter, the daughter of the senior partner of the law firm where he worked. Their first child, [[Charles Evans Hughes Jr.]], was born the following year, and Hughes purchased a house in Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]] neighborhood.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Hughes and his wife would have one son and three daughters.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Their youngest child, [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett]], was one of the first humans injected with [[insulin]], and later served as president of the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]].<ref name=Insulin>{{cite web |url=http://pro-tierisches-insulin.info/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=2 |title=Elizabeth Hughes: Fifty-eight years on animal-insulin |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020003510/http://www.pro-tierisches-insulin.info/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=2 |archivedate=20 October 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Legal and academic career==\n[[File:Mrs._Charles_Evans_Hughes_as_sketched_by_Marguerite_Martyn,_1916.jpg|thumb|upright|Mrs. Hughes, as drawn by journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]] in 1916]]\n\nIn 1883, Hughes took a position with the [[Wall Street]] law firm of Chamberlain, Carter & Hornblower, focusing primarily on matters related to contracts and bankruptcies. He was made a partner in the firm in 1888, and the firm changed its name to Carter, Hughes & Cravath (it later became known as [[Hughes Hubbard & Reed]]). Hughes briefly became a professor at [[Cornell Law School]], but returned to Carter, Hughes & Cravath in 1893.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref> He also joined the board of Brown University and served on a special committee that recommended revisions to New York's Code of Civil Procedure.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=25}}</ref>\n\nResponding to newspaper stories run by the ''[[New York World]]'', in 1905 Governor [[Frank W. Higgins]] appointed a legislative committee to investigate the state's [[Public utility|public utilities]]. On the recommendation of a former state judge who had been impressed by Hughes's performance in court, the legislative committee appointed Hughes to lead the investigation. Hughes was reluctant to take on the powerful utility companies, but Senator [[Frederick C. Stevens (New York)|Frederick C. Stevens]], the leader of the committee, convinced Hughes to accept the position. Hughes decided to center his investigation on Consolidated Gas, which controlled the production and sale of gas in New York City.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Though few expected the committee to have any impact on public corruption, Hughes was able to show that Consolidated Gas had engaged in a pattern of tax evasion and fraudulent bookkeeping. To eliminate or mitigate these abuses, Hughes drafted and convinced the state legislature to pass bills that established a commission to regulate public utilities and lowered gas prices.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=122\u2013123}}</ref> \n\nHughes's success made him a popular public figure in New York, and he was appointed counsel to the [[Armstrong Investigation|Armstrong Insurance Commission]], which investigated the major [[life insurance]] companies headquartered in New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref> His examination of the insurance industry uncovered payments made to journalists and lobbyists, as well as payments and other forms of compensation directed to legislators serving throughout the country. His investigation also showed that many top insurance executives had various conflicts of interest and had received huge raises at the same time that dividends to policyholders had fallen. Seeking to remove Hughes from the investigation, Republican leaders nominated him as the party's candidate for Mayor of New York City, but Hughes refused the nomination. His efforts ultimately resulted in the resignation or firing of the most of top-ranking officials in the three major life insurance companies in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=30\u201336}}</ref> Following the investigation, Hughes convinced the state legislature to bar insurance companies from owning corporate stock, underwriting securities, or engaging in other banking practices.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of New York==\n[[File:CEHughes.png|thumb|left|Gubernatorial portrait of Charles Evans Hughes]]\n\nSeeking a strong candidate to defeat newspaper mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the [[New York state election, 1906|1906 New York gubernatorial election]], President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] convinced New York Republican leaders to nominate Hughes for governor. Roosevelt described Hughes as \"a sane and sincere reformer, who really has fought against the very evils which Hearst denounces, ... [but is] free from any taint of demagogy.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> In his campaign for governor, Hughes attacked the corruption of specific companies but defended corporations as a necessary part of the economy. He also called for an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] on public works projects and favored prohibitions on [[child labor]].<ref name=\"henretta127\">{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|p=127}}</ref> Hughes was not a charismatic speaker, but he campaigned vigorously throughout the state and won the endorsements of most newspapers.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=37\u201338}}</ref> Ultimately, Hughes defeated Hearst in a close election, taking 52 percent of the vote.<ref name=\"henretta127\"/>\n\nHughes's governorship focused largely on reforming the government and addressing political corruption. He expanded the number of civil service positions, increased the power of the public utility regulatory commissions, and won passage of laws that placed limits on political donations by corporations and required political candidates to track campaign receipts and expenditures.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=129\u2013131}}</ref> He also signed laws that barred younger workers from several dangerous occupations and established a maximum forty-eight hour workweek for manufacturing workers under the age of sixteen. To enforce those laws, Hughes reorganized the [[New York State Department of Labor]]. Hughes's labor policies were influenced by economist [[Richard T. Ely]], who sought to improve working conditions for laborers, but rejected the more far-reaching reforms favored by union leaders like [[Samuel Gompers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref> \n\nThough he had once been close to President Roosevelt, relations between Hughes and the president cooled after a dispute over a minor federal appointment.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=39}}</ref> Roosevelt chose not to seek re-election in 1908, instead endorsing Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]] as his preferred successor. Taft won the Republican presidential nomination and asked Hughes to serve as his running mate, but Hughes declined the offer. Hughes also considered retiring from the governorship, but Taft and Roosevelt convinced him to seek a second term. Despite having little support among some of the more conservative leaders of the state party, Hughes won re-election in the [[New York state election, 1908|1908 election]]. Hughes's second term proved to be less successful than his first, but he increased regulation over telephone and telegraph companies and won passage of the first [[workers' compensation]] bill in U.S. history.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=41\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==Associate Justice==\n{{see also|White Court (judges)}}\n[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes, 1902.jpg|thumb|Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] served alongside Hughes on the Supreme Court]]\n\nBy early 1910, Hughes was anxious to retire from his position as governor.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> A vacancy on the Supreme Court arose after the death of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[David J. Brewer]], and Taft offered the position to Hughes. Hughes quickly accepted the offer, and he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on May 2, 1910.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> Shortly after Hughes joined the Supreme Court, Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] died. Taft elevated Associate Justice [[Edward Douglass White]] to the position of Chief Justice, despite having previously indicated to Hughes that he might select Hughes as Chief Justice. White's candidacy for the position was bolstered by his long experience on the bench and popularity among his fellow justices, as well as Theodore Roosevelt's coolness towards Hughes.<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|2008|pp=132\u2013134}}</ref>\n\nHughes quickly struck up friendships with other members of the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice White, Associate Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]], and Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> In the disposition of cases, however, Hughes tended to align with Holmes. He voted to uphold state laws providing for minimum wages, workmen's compensation, and maximum work hours for women and children.<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|p=27}}</ref> He also wrote several opinions upholding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce under the [[Commerce Clause]]. His majority opinion in ''Baltimore & Ohio Railroad vs. Interstate Commerce Commission'' upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoemaker|2004|pp=63\u201364}}</ref> His majority opinion in the 1914 [[Houston East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States|Shreveport Rate Case]] upheld the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]'s decision to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the [[Railroad Commission of Texas]]. The decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce, though Hughes avoided directly overruling the 1895 case of ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}</ref> \n\nHe also wrote a series of opinions that upheld civil liberties; in one such case, ''[[McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co.]]'', Hughes's majority opinion required railroad carriers to give African-Americans \"equal treatment.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|p=150}}</ref> Hughes's majority opinion in ''[[Bailey v. Alabama]]'' invalidated a state law that had made it a crime for a laborer to fail to complete obligations agreed to in a labor contract. Hughes held that this law violated the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] and discriminated against African-American workers.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoemaker|2004|pp=63\u201364}}</ref> He also joined the majority decision in the 1915 case of ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'', which outlawed the use of [[grandfather clause]]s to determine voter enfranchisement.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoemaker|2004|p=224}}</ref> Along with Holmes, Hughes was one of two Justices to dissent from the court's ruling that affirmed a lower court's decision to withhold a writ of habeas corpus from [[Leo Frank]], a [[Jewish]] factory manager convicted of murder in the state of Georgia.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n==Presidential candidate==\n{{further|United States presidential election, 1916}}\n[[File:Charles E Hughes campaigning in Winona MN 1916.jpg|thumb|Hughes in [[Winona, Minnesota]], during the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] presidential campaign campaigning on the [[Olympian Hiawatha|Olympian]]]]\n\nTaft and Roosevelt endured a bitter split during Taft's presidency, and Roosevelt challenged Taft for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. Taft won re-nomination, but Roosevelt ran on the ticket of a [[third party (United States)|third party]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=82}}</ref> With the split in the Republican Party, Democratic Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]] defeated Taft and Roosevelt in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 presidential election]] and enacted his progressive [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]] agenda.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|pp=142\u2013143}}</ref> Seeking to bridge the divide in the Republican Party and limit Wilson to a single term, several Republican leaders asked Hughes to consider running in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916 presidential election]]. Hughes at first rebuffed these entreaties, but his potential candidacy became the subject of widespread speculation and polls showed that he was the preferred candidate of many Republican voters. By the time of the June [[1916 Republican National Convention]], Hughes had won two presidential primaries, and his backers had lined up the support of numerous delegates. Hughes led on the first presidential ballot of the convention and clinched the nomination on the third ballot. Hughes accepted the nomination, becoming the first and only sitting Supreme Court Justice to serve as a [[List of United States major party presidential tickets|major party's presidential nominee]], and submitted his resignation to President Wilson. Roosevelt, meanwhile, declined to run again on a third party ticket, leaving Hughes and Wilson as the only major candidates in the race.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=95\u201399}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1916.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|1916 electoral vote results]]\n\nBecause of the Republican Party's dominance in presidential elections held since the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Hughes was widely regarded as the favorite even though Wilson was the incumbent. His candidacy was further boosted by his own reputation for intelligence, personal integrity, and moderation. Hughes also won the public support of both Taft and Roosevelt, though Roosevelt remained uneasy with Hughes, whom he feared would be a \"Wilson with whiskers.\" However, the split in Republican ranks remained a lingering issue, and Hughes damaged his campaign by inadvertently snubbing [[Hiram Johnson]], the Governor of California who had been Roosevelt's running mate in the 1912 election.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=99\u2013102}}</ref> Because of Hughes's opposition to the [[Adamson Act]] and the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], most former Progressive Party leaders endorsed Wilson.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|p=144}}</ref> By election day, Hughes was still generally considered to be the favorite. He performed strongly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and early election returns nearly convinced Wilson to concede the election. However, Wilson swept the [[Solid South]] and won several victories in the Midwest, where his candidacy was boosted by a strong pacifist sentiment. Wilson ultimately prevailed after winning the state of California by less than 4,000 votes.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=104}}</ref> \n\nAfter the election, Hughes turned down offers from larger organizations and returned to his small law firm, now known as Hughes, Rounds, Schurman & Dwight.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=115}}</ref> In March 1917, Hughes joined with many other Republican leaders in demanding that Wilson declare war on the [[Central Powers]] after [[German Empire|Germany]] sank several American merchant ships. The next month, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, and the United States entered [[World War I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=106\u2013108}}</ref> Hughes supported Wilson's military policies, including the imposition of the draft, and he served as chairman of New York City's draft appeals board. He also investigated the aircraft industry on behalf of the Wilson administration, exposing numerous inefficiencies.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=115\u2013116}}</ref> He once again returned to private practice after the war, serving a wide array of clients, including five [[Socialist Party of America|Socialists]] who had been expelled from the New York legislature due to their political beliefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref> He sought to broker a compromise between President Wilson and Senate Republicans regarding U.S. entrance into Wilson's proposed [[League of Nations]], but the Senate rejected the League and the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=121\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nWith Wilson's popularity declining, many Republican leaders believed that their party would win the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]]. Hughes remained popular in the party, and many influential Republicans favored him as the party's candidate in 1920. Hughes was struck by personal disaster when his daughter, Helen, died in 1920, and he refused to allow his name to be considered for the presidential nomination at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]]. The party instead nominated a ticket consisting of Senator [[Warren G.

Hughes told Harding he was uninterested in leaving the State Department, and Harding instead appointed former President Taft as the Chief Justice.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=151\u2013152}}</ref> Harding granted Hughes a great deal of discretion in his leadership of the State Department and U.S. foreign policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=150\u20131511}}</ref> Harding and Hughes frequently communicated, and the president remained well-informed regarding the state of foreign affairs, but he rarely overrode any of Hughes's decisions.{{sfn|Trani|Wilson|pp=109\u2013110}} \n\nHughes did have to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League.{{sfn|Trani|Wilson|pp=142\u2013145}} Hughes had favored U.S. membership in the League, and early in his tenure as Secretary of State he asked the Senate to vote on the Treaty of Versailles, but he acceded to Harding's stance on the League and the treaty.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=150\u2013151}}</ref> He was, however, able to convince Harding of the necessity of a separate treaty with Germany, resulting in the signing and eventual ratification of the [[U.S.\u2013German Peace Treaty (1921)|U.S.\u2013German Peace Treaty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref> Hughes also favored U.S. entrance into the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], but was unable to convince the Senate to provide support for this initiative.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=164\u2013165}}</ref>\n\n===Washington Naval Treaty===\n\nHughes's major initiative in office was naval disarmament, as he sought to prevent a naval [[arms race]] among the three great naval powers of Britain, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and the United States. After Senator [[William Borah]] led passage of a resolution calling on the Harding administration to negotiate an arms reduction treaty with Japan and Britain, Hughes convinced those countries, as well as Italy and France, to attend a naval conference in Washington. Hughes selected an American delegation consisting of himself, former Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]], Republican Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], and Democratic Senator [[Oscar Underwood]]; he hoped that the selection of Underwood would ensure bipartisan support for any treaty arising from the conference. Prior to the conference, Hughes carefully considered possible treaty terms, since each side would seek terms that would provide their respective navy with subtle advantages. He decided to propose an arms reduction formula based on the immediate halting of all naval construction, with future construction limits based on the ship tonnage of each country. The formula would be based on the ship tonnage ratio of 1920, which stood at roughly 5:5:3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, respectively. Knowing that U.S. and foreign naval leaders would resist his proposal, he anxiously guarded it from the press, but he won the support of Root, Lodge, and Underwood.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=154\u2013156}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Washington Naval Conference]] opened in November 1921, attended by five national delegations, and, in the gallery, hundreds of reporters and dignitaries such as Chief Justice Taft and [[William Jennings Bryan]]. On the first day of the conference, Hughes unveiled his proposal to limit naval armaments. Hughes's ambitious proposal to scrap all U.S. [[capital ship]]s under construction stunned the delegates, as did his proposals for the Japanese and British navies.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=156\u2013158}}</ref> The British delegation, led by [[Arthur Balfour]], supported the proposal, but the Japanese delegation, under the leadership of [[Kat\u014d Tomosabur\u014d]], asked for several modifications. Kat\u014d asked that the ratio be adjusted to 10:10:7 and refused to destroy the ''[[Japanese battleship Mutsu|Mutsu]]'', a [[dreadnought]] that many Japanese saw as a symbol of national pride. Kat\u014d eventually relented on the naval ratios, but Hughes acquiesced to the retention of the ''Mutsu'', leading to protests from British leaders. Hughes clinched an agreement after convincing Balfour to agree to limit the size of the [[Admiral-class battlecruiser]]s despite objections from the British navy. Hughes also won agreement on the [[Four-Power Treaty]], which called for a peaceful resolution of territorial claims in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as well as the [[Nine-Power Treaty]], which guaranteed the territorial integrity of [[China]]. News of the success of the conference was warmly received around the world; [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] would later write that the conference \"brought to the world the first important voluntary agreement for limitation and reduction of armament.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=159\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n===Other issues===\n{{see also|Banana Wars}}\n\nIn the [[aftermath of World War I]], the German economy struggled from the strain of postwar rebuilding and war reparations owed to the Entente, while the Entente powers in turn owed large war debts to the United States. Though many economists favored cancellation of all European war debts, French leaders were unwilling to cancel the reparations, and Congress refused to consider forgiving the war debts. Hughes helped organize the creation of an international committee of economists to study the possibility of lowering Germany's reparations, and Hughes selected [[Charles G. Dawes]] to lead that committee. The resulting [[Dawes Plan]], which provided for annual payments by Germany, was accepted at a 1924 conference held in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=163\u2013164}}</ref>\n\nHughes sought better relations with the countries of [[Latin America]], and he favored removing U.S. troops when he believed that doing so was practicable. He formulated plans for the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Nicaragua]], but decided that instability in [[Haiti]] required the continued presence of U.S. soldiers. He also settled a border dispute between [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]] by threatening to send soldiers into Panama.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=162\u2013163}}</ref>\n\n==Return to private practice==\n\nHughes stayed on as Secretary of State in the Coolidge administration after the death of Harding in 1923, but he left office in early 1925.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=165}}</ref> He once again returned to his law firm, becoming one of the highest-earning lawyers in the country. He also served as a [[special master]] in a case concerning [[Chicago]]'s sewage system, was elected president of the [[American Bar Association]], and co-founded the [[National Conference for Community and Justice|National Conference on Christians and Jews]]. State party leaders asked him to run against [[Al Smith]] in New York's 1926 gubernatorial election, and some national party leaders suggested that he run for president in 1928, but Hughes declined to seek public office. After the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] nominated [[Herbert Hoover]], Hughes gave Hoover his full support and campaigned for him across the United States. Hoover won the election in a landslide and asked Hughes to serve as his Secretary of State, but Hughes declined the offer in order to keep his commitment to serve as a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=172\u2013174, 176}}</ref>\n\n==Chief Justice==\n{{see also|Hughes Court|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Hughes Court|Herbert Hoover Supreme Court candidates}}\n\n===Rejoining the Court===\n[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Hughes as Chief Justice]]\n\nIn February 1930, President Hoover announced his nomination of Charles Evans Hughes to succeed Chief Justice Taft, who was fatally ill. Though many had expected Hoover to elevate his close friend, Associate Justice [[Harlan Stone]], Hughes was the top choice of Taft and Attorney General [[William D. Mitchell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|2008|pp=156\u2013157}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref> Though Hughes had compiled a progressive record during his tenure as an Associate Justice, by 1930 Taft believed that Hughes would be a consistent conservative on the court.<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|pp=27\u201328}}</ref> The nomination faced resistance from progressive Republicans like Senator [[George W. Norris]] and William Borah, who were concerned that Hughes would be overly friendly to big business after working as a corporate lawyer.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1187\u20131188}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wittes|2006|p=50}}</ref> Many of these progressives, as well some Southern states' rights advocates, were outraged by the [[Taft Court]]'s tendency to strike down state and federal legislation on the basis of the doctrine of [[substantive due process]] and feared that a Hughes Court would emulate the Taft Court.<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|pp=24\u201325, 30}}</ref> Adherents of the substantive due process doctrine held that economic regulations such as restrictions on child labor and minimum wages violated [[freedom of contract]], which, they argued, could not be abridged by federal and state laws because of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=193\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief but bitter confirmation battle, Hughes was confirmed by the Senate in a 52-to-26 vote.<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|2008|pp=157\u2013158}}</ref> Hughes's son, Charles Jr., was forced to resign as [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] after his father took office as Chief Justice.<ref>{{harvnb|Parrish|2002|p=10}}</ref> Hughes quickly emerged as a leader of the Court, earning the admiration of his fellow justices for his intelligence, energy, and strong understanding of the law.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=194}}</ref> Shortly after Hughes was confirmed, Hoover nominated federal judge [[John J. Parker]] to succeed deceased Associate Justice [[Edward Terry Sanford]]. The Senate rejected Parker, whose earlier rulings had alienated labor unions and the [[NAACP]], but confirmed Hoover's second nominee, [[Owen Roberts]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parrish|2002|p=11\u201312}}</ref> In early 1932, the other justices asked Hughes to request the resignation of Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose health had declined as he entered his nineties. Hughes privately asked his old friend to retire, and Holmes immediately sent a letter of resignation to President Hoover. To replace Holmes, Hoover nominated [[Benjamin Cardozo]], who quickly won confirmation.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> The early Hughes Court was divided between the conservative \"[[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|Four Horsemen]]\" and the liberal \"[[Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|Three Musketeers]].\"{{efn|After the appointment of Benjamin Cardozo, the liberal bloc consisted of Cardozo, Harlan Stone, and Louis Brandeis. The conservative bloc consisted of [[Willis Van Devanter]], [[James Clark McReynolds]], [[George Sutherland]], and [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=181\u2013186, 246}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"L11881189\"/> The primary difference between these two blocs was that the Four Horsemen embraced the substantive due process doctrine, while liberals like [[Louis Brandeis]] advocated for [[judicial restraint]], or deference to legislative bodies.<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> Hughes and Roberts would be the swing justice between these two blocs for much of the 1930s.<ref>{{harvnb|Henretta|2006|p=149}}</ref> \n\nIn one of the first major cases of his tenure, Hughes joined with Roberts and the Three Musketeers to strike down a piece of state legislation in the 1931 landmark case of ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]''. In his majority opinion, Hughes held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] barred states from violating [[freedom of the press]]. Hughes also wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', which represented the first time the Supreme Court struck down a state law on the basis of the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].{{efn|Justice [[Edward Terry Sanford]] had laid out the doctrine of incorporation in the majority opinion of the 1925 case of ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]''.<ref name=\"L11881189\"/>}}<ref name=\"L11881189\">{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1188\u20131189}}</ref> In another early case, ''[[O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.]]'', Hughes and Roberts joined with the liberal bloc in upholding a state regulation that limited commissions for the sale of fire insurance.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n===Roosevelt takes office===\n\nDuring [[presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover's presidency]], the country plunged into the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=186}}</ref> As the country faced an ongoing economic calamity, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] decisively defeated Hoover in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|p=37}}</ref> Responding to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Roosevelt passed a bevy of domestic legislation as part of his [[New Deal]] domestic program, and the response to the New Deal became one of the key issues facing the Hughes Court. In the [[Gold Clause Cases]], a series of cases that presented some of the first major tests of New Deal laws, the Hughes Court upheld restrictions on the ownership of gold that were favored by the Roosevelt administration.<ref name=\"L11891192\"/> Roosevelt, who had expected the Supreme Court to rule adversely to administration's position, was elated by the outcome, writing, \"as a lawyer it seems to me that the Supreme Court has at last definitely put human values ahead of the 'pound of flesh' called for by a contract.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=254\u2013257}}</ref> The Hughes Court also continued to adjudicate major cases concerning the states. In the 1934 case of ''[[Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell]]'', Hughes and Roberts joined the Three Musketeers in upholding a Minnesota law that established a moratorium on mortgage payments.<ref name=\"L11891192\">{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1189\u20131192}}</ref> Hughes's majority opinion in that case stated that \"while an emergency does not create power, an emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=246\u2013247}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the 1935 case of Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co., Roberts started siding with the Four Horsemen, creating a majority bloc that struck down New Deal laws.<ref name=\"L1192\"/> The court held that Congress had, in passing an act that provided a mandatory retirement and pension system for railroad industry workers, violated due process and exceeded the regulatory powers granted to it by the [[Commerce Clause]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=257\u2013258}}</ref> Hughes strongly criticized Roberts's majority opinion in his dissent, writing that \"the power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it be perfect. The power implies a broad discretion.\"<ref name=\"L1192\"/> Nonetheless, in May 1935, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down three New Deal laws. Writing the majority opinion in ''[[A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', Hughes held that Roosevelt's [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]] was doubly unconstitutional, falling afoul of both the Commerce Clause and the [[nondelegation doctrine]].<ref name=\"L1192\">{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1192\u20131193}}</ref> \n\nIn the 1936 case of ''[[United States v. Butler]]'', Hughes surprised many observers by joining with Roberts and the Four Horsemen in striking down the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]].<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1193\u20131194}}</ref> In doing so, the court dismantled the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the major New Deal agricultural program.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=273\u2013274, 282}}</ref> In another 1936 case, ''[[Carter v. Carter Coal Co.]]'', the Supreme Court struck down the [[Guffey Coal Act]], which regulated the [[bituminous coal]] industry. Hughes wrote a concurring opinion in ''Carter'' in which he agreed with the majority's holding that Congress could not use its Commerce Clause powers to \"regulate activities and relations\nwithin the states which affect interstate commerce only indirectly.\" In the final case of the 1936 term, ''Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo'', Roberts joined with the Four Horsemen in striking down New York's minimum wage law.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|p=1195}}</ref> President Roosevelt had held up the New York minimum wage law as a model for other states to follow, and many Republicans as well as Democrats attacked the decision for interfering with the states.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=289\u2013291}}</ref> In December 1936, the court handed down its near-unanimous opinion in ''[[United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.]]'', upholding a law that granted the president the power to place an arms embargo on [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]]. Justice Sutherland's majority opinion, which Hughes joined, explained that the Constitution had granted the president broad powers to conduct foreign policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=303}}</ref>\n\n===Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937===\n[[File:Erich Salomon - The Supreme Court, 1937.jpg|alt=The Court seated|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Hughes Court]] in 1937, photographed by [[Erich Salomon]].]]\n\nRoosevelt won re-election in a landslide in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]], while congressional Democrats grew their majorities in both houses of Congress.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=298}}</ref> As the Supreme Court had already struck down both the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the president feared that the court would next strike down other key New Deal laws, including the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] (also known as the Wagner Act) and the [[Social Security Act]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=306}}</ref> In early 1937, Roosevelt proposed to increase the number of Supreme Court seats through the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]] (also known as the \"court-packing plan\"). Roosevelt argued that the bill was necessary because Supreme Court justices were unable to meet their case load. With large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, Roosevelt's bill had a strong chance of passage in early 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1196\u20131197}}</ref> However, the bill was poorly received by the public, as many saw the bill as power grab or as an attack on a sacrosanct institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=316\u2013318}}</ref> Hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort, rushing important New Deal legislation through the Supreme Court in an effort to quickly uphold the constitutionality of the laws.<ref name=\"shesol394397\">{{harvnb|Shesol|2010|pp=394\u2013397}}</ref> He also sent a letter to Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]], asserting that the Supreme Court was fully capable of handling its case load. Hughes's letter had a powerful impact in discrediting Roosevelt's argument about the practical need for more Supreme Court justices.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1196\u20131198}}</ref>\n\nWhile the debate over the court-packing plan continued, the Supreme Court upheld, in a 5-4 vote, the state of Washington's minimum wage law in the case of ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. Joined by the Three Musketeers and Roberts, Hughes wrote the majority opinion,<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1198\u20131199}}</ref> which overturned the 1923 case of ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalman|2005|pp=1052\u20131053}}</ref> In his majority opinion, Hughes wrote that the \"Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract,\" and further held that the Washington legislature \"was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the 'sweating system,' the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=325\u2013327}}</ref> Because Roberts had previously sided with the four conservative justices in ''Tipaldo'', a similar case, it was widely perceived that Roberts only agreed to uphold the constitutionality of minimum wage as a result of the pressure that was put on the Supreme Court by the court-packing plan (a theory referred to as \"[[the switch in time that saved nine]]\").<ref>{{harvnb|McKenna|2002|p=419}}</ref> However, Hughes and Roberts would both later indicate that Roberts had committed to changing his judicial stance on state minimum wage law months before Roosevelt announced his court-packing plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalman|2005|p=1054}}</ref> Roberts had [[Rule of four|voted]] to grant ''[[Writ of certiorari|certiorari]]'' to hear the ''Parrish'' case even before the 1936 presidential election, and oral arguments for the case had taken place in late 1936.<ref name=uopqpvz32>{{harvnb|McKenna|2002|pp=412\u2013413}}</ref> In an initial conference vote held on December 19, 1936, Roberts had voted to uphold the law.<ref name=\"McKenna414\">{{harvnb|McKenna|2002|p=414}}</ref> Scholars continue to debate why Roberts essentially switched his vote with regards to state minimum wage laws, but Hughes may have played an important role in influencing Roberts to uphold the law.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1198\u20131200}}</ref>\n\nWeeks after the court handed down its decision in ''Parrish'', Hughes wrote for the majority again in ''[[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.]]''. Joined by Roberts and the Three Musketeers, Hughes upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act case marked a turning point for the Supreme Court, as the court began a pattern of upholding New Deal laws.<ref>{{harvnb|Leuchtenburg|2005|pp=1200\u20131201}}</ref> Later in 1937, the court upheld both the old age benefits and the taxation system established by the Social Security Act. Meanwhile, conservative Associate Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] announced his retirement, undercutting Roosevelt's arguments for the necessity of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=334\u2013336}}</ref> By the end of the year, the court-packing plan had died in the Senate, and Roosevelt had been dealt a serious political wound that emboldened the [[conservative coalition]] of Southern Democrats and Republicans.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalman|2005|p=1057}}</ref> Yet throughout 1937, Hughes had presided over a massive shift in jurisprudence that marked the end of the [[Lochner era]], a period during in which the Supreme Court had frequently struck down state and federal economic regulations.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalman|2005|p=1052\u20131053}}</ref> [[Hugo Black]], Roosevelt's nominee to succeed Van Devanter, was confirmed by the Senate in August 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=345\u2013347}}</ref> He was joined by [[Stanley Forman Reed]], who succeeded Sutherland, the following year, leaving pro-New Deal liberals with a majority on the Supreme Court.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=357}}</ref>{{efn|[[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[William O.

Carolene Products Co.]]'', Justice Stone's majority opinion articulated a broad theory of deference to economic regulations. ''Carolene Products'' established that the Supreme Court would conduct a \"[[rational basis review]]\" of economic regulations, meaning that the Court would only strike down a regulation if legislators lacked a \"rational basis\" for passing the regulation. The Supreme Court showed that it would defer to state legislators in the cases of ''Madden V. Kentucky'' and ''[[Olsen v. Nebraska]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2007|p=141\u2013142}}</ref> Hughes joined the majority in  another case, ''[[United States v.

Hughes wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'', which required the state of Missouri to either integrate its law school or establish a separate law school for African-Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref> He joined and helped arrange unanimous support for Black's majority opinion in ''[[Chambers v.

In June 1941, he informed Roosevelt of his impending retirement.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=382\u2013386}}</ref> Hughes suggested that Roosevelt elevate Stone to the position of Chief Justice, a suggestion that Roosevelt accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|p=387}}</ref> Hughes retired in 1941, and Stone was confirmed as the new Chief Justice, beginning the [[Stone Court (judges)|Stone Court]].\n\n==Retirement and death==\n\nDuring his retirement, Hughes generally refrained from re-entering public life or giving advice on public policy, though he did agree to review the [[United Nations Charter]] for Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]].<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=387\u2013388}}</ref> He lived in New York City with his wife, Antoinette, until she died in December 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|Simon|2012|pp=388\u2013389}}</ref> On August 27, 1948, at the age of 86, Hughes died in what is now the Tiffany Cottage of the [[Wianno Club]] in [[Osterville]], [[Massachusetts]].

Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.\n\n==Name==\nThe name is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''clavis'', meaning \"key\" (associated with more common ''clavus'', meaning \"nail, rod, etc.\") and ''chorda'' (from Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae) meaning \"string, especially of a musical instrument\". An analogous name is used in other European languages (It. ''clavicordio'', ''clavicordo''; Fr. ''clavicorde''; Germ. ''Klavichord''; Lat. ''clavicordium''; Port. ''clavic\u00f3rdio''; Sp. ''clavicordio''). Many languages also have another name derived from Latin ''manus'', meaning \"hand\" (It. ''manicordo''; Fr. ''manicorde'', ''manicordion''; Sp. ''manicordio'', ''manucordio''). Other names refer to the [[monochord]]-like nature of a fully fretted clavichord (It. ''monacordo'' or ''monocordo''; Sp. ''monacordio''). Italian also used ''sordino'', a reference to its quiet sound ([[sordino]] usually designates a mute).<ref>All of these translations appear in {{GroveOnline|title=Clavichord|author=Edwin M. Ripin|display-authors=etal|access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History and use==\nThe clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Brauchli|1998}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Jeans|1951}}</ref> In 1404, the German poem \"{{Lang|de|Der Minne Regeln|italic=no}}\" mentions the terms ''clavicimbalum'' (a term used mainly for the [[harpsichord]]) and ''clavichordium'', designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies.\n\n[[File:Clavicorde L\u00e9pante.JPG|thumb|The \"L\u00e9pante\" fretted clavichord,<ref>[http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/masc/?INSTANCE=CITEMUSIQUE&URL=/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp Catalogue entry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419124012/http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/masc/?INSTANCE=CITEMUSIQUE&URL=%2Fclientbooklinecimu%2Frecherche%2FNoticeDetailleByID.asp |date=2014-04-19 }} for the L\u00e9pante clavichord, [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]], Paris (in French)</ref> Mus\u00e9e de la Musique, Paris]]\n\nOne of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:\n<blockquote>Item. The same day, [[Hugh Denys]] for money by him delivered to a stranger that gave the queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns form his reward iiii libres.<ref>Brinsmead, Edgar. History of the Pianoforte, London, 1879. pp. 90\u201391</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe clavichord was very popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, but mainly flourished in German-speaking lands, [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the latter part of this period. It had fallen out of use by 1850. In the late 1890s, [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] revived clavichord construction and [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]], among others, helped to popularize the instrument. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small (four octaves, four feet long), the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nToday clavichords are played primarily by Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical music enthusiasts. They attract many interested buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument have included [[Christopher Hogwood]] and [[Thurston Dart]].\n\n===Modern music===\nThe clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, in the form of the [[Clavinet]], which is essentially an electric clavichord that uses a magnetic pickup to produce a signal for amplification. [[Stevie Wonder]] uses a Clavinet in many of his songs, such as \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" and \"[[Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)|Higher Ground]]\". A Clavinet played through an [[instrument amplifier]] with guitar [[effect pedal]]s is often associated with [[funk]]y, [[disco]]-infused 1970s rock.\n\n[[Guy Sigsworth]] has played clavichord in a modern setting with [[Bj\u00f6rk]], notably on the studio recording of \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\". Bj\u00f6rk also made extensive use of and even played the instrument herself on the song \"My Juvenile\" of her 2007 album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.\n\n[[Tori Amos]] uses the instrument on \"Little Amsterdam\" from the album ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' and on the song \"Smokey Joe\" from her 2007 album ''[[American Doll Posse]]''. Amos also featured her use of the [[Clavinet]] on her 2004 recording \"Not David Bowie\", released as part of her 2006 [[box set]], ''[[A Piano: The Collection]]''.\n\nIn 1976 [[Oscar Peterson]] played (with Joe Pass on acoustic guitar) songs from ''Porgy And Bess'' on the clavichord. [[Keith Jarrett]] also recorded an album entitled ''Book of Ways'' (1986) in which he plays a series of clavichord improvisations. [[The Beatles]]' \"[[For No One]]\" (1966) features [[Paul McCartney]] playing the clavichord. [[Rick Wakeman]] plays the Clavinet in the track \"The Battle\" from the album ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]''.\n\n==Structure and action==\n<!--[[Tangent (clavichord)]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Clavichord action.svg|thumb|500px|Schematic diagram of clavichord mechanism: A/B.

The introduction to this book contains far more detailed and accurate diagrams, labeled by the technical names of the different parts of the clavichord.</ref>]]\n[[File:122 Museu de la M\u00fasica.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Clavichord at [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\nIn the clavichord, strings run transversely from the [[hitchpin rail]] at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the ''hammering'' technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]] and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as ''[[Bebung]]''). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.\n\nThe action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player's hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord.\n\n==Fretting==\n[[File:Clavichord-JA Haas 007 reworked.jpg|thumb|left|Large five-octave unfretted clavichord by Paul Maurici, after [[Johann Adolph Hass|J.A. Hass]]]]\n[[File:Clavicord.jpg|thumb|Fretted clavichord, copy of an unsigned instrument conserved in [[Namur, Belgium]]. The way the same string pair is used for several notes is clearly visible in the full size image.]]\nSince the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called ''fretting''. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed [[monochord]]\u2014an instrument with only one string\u2014though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C{{music|#}}) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of [[Musical tuning|tuning]] (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in [[chamber music]]), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: [[Musical temperament|temperament]] could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a [[legato]] line.\n\nSome clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by [[Johann Speth]] in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as ''unfretted'' whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called ''fretted''. Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for \"bad\" notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and ''many'' more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords.\n\n==Pedal clavichord==\n[[File:Pedal-clavichord.jpg|thumb|J. Verscheure Reynvaan: engraving of an eighteenth-century pedal clavichord]]\n{{Main article|Pedal clavichord}}\n\nWhile clavichords were typically single manual instruments, they could be stacked, one clavichord on top of another, to provide multiple keyboards. With the addition of a [[pedal clavichord]], which included a [[pedal keyboard]] for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice organ repertoire. Most often, the addition of a pedal keyboard only involved connecting the keys of the pedalboard to the lower notes on the manual clavichord using string so the lower notes on the manual instrument could be operated by the feet. In the era of [[pipe organ]]s, which used man-powered bellows that required several people to operate, and of churches only heated during church services if at all, organists used [[harpsichord|pedal harpsichord]]s and pedal clavichords as practice instruments (see also: [[pedal piano]]).<ref>The use of the pedal clavichord as a practice instrument is discussed by Friedrich Griepenkerl in the 1844 foreword to Volume I of the first edition of the complete organ works of J.S. Bach; see {{harvnb|Riemenschneider|1950}}.</ref> There is speculation that some works written for organ may have been intended for pedal clavichord. An interesting case is made by {{harvtxt|Speerstra|2004}} that [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Eight Short Preludes and Fugues|\"Eight Little Preludes and Fugues\"]], now thought spurious, may actually be authentic. The keyboard writing seems unsuited to organ, but Speerstra argues that they are idiomatic on the pedal clavichord. As Speerstra and {{harvtxt|Williams|2003}} also note, the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach's [[Organ sonatas, BWV 525\u2013530|six trio sonatas for organ]] (BWV 525\u2013530) rarely go below the tenor C, so they could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century.\n\n==Repertoire==\nMuch of the musical repertoire written for [[harpsichord]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] from the period circa 1400\u20131800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it does not have enough (unamplified) volume to participate in chamber music, with the possible exception of providing accompaniment to a soft baroque flute, recorder, or single singer. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] was a great proponent of the instrument, and most of his German contemporaries regarded it as a central keyboard instrument, for performing, teaching, composing and practicing. The fretting of a clavichord provides new problems for some repertoire, but scholarship suggests that these problems are not insurmountable in Bach's [[Well-Tempered Clavier]] ({{harvtxt|Loucks|1992}}). Among recent clavichord recordings, those by [[Christopher Hogwood]] (''The Secret Bach'', ''The Secret Handel'',<!-- That's the title: see http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000CDYDGC --> and ''The Secret Mozart''), break new ground. In his liner notes, Hogwood pointed out that these composers would typically have played the clavichord in the privacy of their homes. In England, the composer [[Herbert Howells]] (1892\u20131983) wrote two significant collections of pieces for clavichord (''[[Herbert Lambert|Lambert]]'s Clavichord'' and ''Howells' Clavichord''), and [[Stephen Dodgson]] (1924\u20132013) wrote two clavichord suites.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* {{citation|title=The Harpsichord and Clavichord: An Encyclopedia|first=Igor|last=Kipnis|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0415937655}}\n* {{citation|title=The Clavichord|first=Bernard |last=Brauchli|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1998|isbn=0-521-63067-3}}\n*{{citation|title=The Pedal Clavichord and Other Practice Instruments of Organists|first=Susi|last= Jeans|jstor=766144|series= Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, 77th Sess., 1950\u20131951|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1951}}\n*{{citation|title=Early Keyboard Instruments in European Museums|first=Edward L.|last= Kottick|publisher=Indiana University Press|year= 1997|isbn=0-253-33239-7}}\n*{{citation|first=Albert|last=Riemenschneider|authorlink=Albert Riemenschneider|volume=2067|title=Preface and translations of forewords by Friedrich Griepenkerl to Organ works of J.S.

There are ''two'' forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball ''m'''''g''', where ''m'' is the mass of the ball and '''g''' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]; the second is the upward [[normal force]] exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface ''m'''''a'''<sub>n</sub>. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the [[net force]] on the ball resulting from [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] and the [[force of gravity]]. The resultant or [[net force]] on the ball found by [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] exerted by the road and vertical force due to [[gravity]] must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.\n\nThe horizontal net force on the ball is the horizontal component of the force from the road, which has magnitude |'''F'''<sub>h</sub>| = ''m''|'''a'''<sub>n</sub>|sin''\u03b8''. The vertical component of the force from the road must counteract the gravitational force: |'''F'''<sub>v</sub>| = ''m''|'''a'''<sub>n</sub>|cos''\u03b8'' = ''m''|'''g'''|, which implies |'''a'''<sub>n</sub>|=|'''g'''| / cos''\u03b8''. Substituting into the above formula for |'''F'''<sub>h</sub>| yields a horizontal force to be:\n\n: <math> |\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{h}| = m |\\mathbf{g}| \\frac { \\mathrm{sin}\\ \\theta}{ \\mathrm {cos}\\ \\theta} = m|\\mathbf{g}| \\mathrm{tan}\\ \\theta \\ . </math>\n\nOn the other hand, at velocity |'''v'''| on a circular path of radius ''r'', kinematics says that the force needed to turn the ball continuously into the turn is the radially inward centripetal force '''F'''<sub>c</sub> of magnitude:\n\n: <math>|\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{c}| = m |\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{c}| = \\frac{m|\\mathbf{v}|^2}{r} \\ . </math>\n\nConsequently, the ball is in a stable path when the angle of the road is set to satisfy the condition:\n\n: <math>m |\\mathbf{g}| \\mathrm{tan}\\ \\theta = \\frac{m|\\mathbf{v}|^2}{r} \\ ,</math>\n\nor,\n\n: <math> \\mathrm{tan}\\ \\theta = \\frac {|\\mathbf{v}|^2} {|\\mathbf{g}|r} \\ .</math>\n\nAs the angle of bank ''\u03b8'' approaches 90\u00b0, the [[tangent function]] approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |'''v'''|<sup>2</sup>/''r''. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |'''v'''|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for ''\u03b8''), and for sharper turns (smaller ''r'') the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle ''\u03b8'' does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If [[friction]] cannot do this (that is, the [[coefficient of friction]] is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.<ref name = Schaum>{{cite book |title = Schaum's Outline of Applied Physics |author = Arthur Beiser |page = 103 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=soKguvJDgmsC&pg=PA103&dq=friction+%22banked+turn%22\n|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional |year = 2004 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-07-142611-4}}</ref><ref name = Darbyshire>{{cite book |title = Mechanical Engineering: BTEC National Option Units |author = Alan Darbyshire |page = 56 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=fzfXLGpElZ0C&pg=PA57&dq=centripetal+%22banked+curve%22\n|isbn = 978-0-7506-5761-7 |publisher = Newnes |year = 2003 |location = Oxford}}</ref>\n\nThese ideas apply to air flight as well.

Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> and an angular unit vector '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub>, as shown above.<ref name = polar>Although the polar coordinate system moves with the particle, the observer does not. The description of the particle motion remains a description from the stationary observer's point of view.</ref> A particle at position '''r''' is described by:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\rho \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the notation ''\u03c1'' is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of ''R'' to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''). Unit vector '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub>. Thus, '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> and '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path traveled by the particle.<ref>Notice that this local coordinate system is not autonomous; for example, its rotation in time is dictated by the trajectory traced by the particle. Note also that the radial vector '''r'''(''t'') does not represent the [[Osculating circle|radius of curvature]] of the path.</ref> By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> and '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle ''\u03b8''(''t'') as '''r'''(''t'').\n\nWhen the particle moves, its velocity is\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} + \\rho \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\ . </math>\n\nTo evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> is needed. Because '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change d'''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> has a component only perpendicular to '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub>. When the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''\u03b8'', '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub>, which points in the same direction as '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''\u03b8''. See image above. Therefore, the change in '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> is\n\n: <math> \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} = \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\ , </math>\n\nor\n\n: <math> \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\ . </math>\n\nIn a similar fashion, the rate of change of '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> is found. As with '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub>, '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> while the trajectory '''r'''(''t'') rotates an amount d''\u03b8'', '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub>, which is orthogonal to '''r'''(''t''), also rotates by d''\u03b8''. See image above. Therefore, the change d'''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> is orthogonal to '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> and proportional to d''\u03b8'' (see image above):\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\ . </math>\n\nThe image above shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if d'''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> is positive with d''\u03b8'', then d'''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> must decrease.\n\nSubstituting the derivative of '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> into the expression for velocity:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} + \\rho \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t} = v_{\\rho} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} + v_{\\theta} \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} = \\mathbf{v}_{\\rho} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\theta} \\ . </math>\n\nTo obtain the acceleration, another time differentiation is done:\n: <math> \\mathbf{a} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} + \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t} + \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t} + \\rho \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\ . </math>\n\nSubstituting the derivatives of '''u'''<sub>\u03c1</sub> and '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub>, the acceleration of the particle is:<ref name = Taylor>{{cite book |title = Classical Mechanics |author = John Robert Taylor |pages = 28\u201329 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&printsec=index&dq=isbn=189138922X\n|year = 2005 |isbn = 978-1-891389-22-1 |publisher = University Science Books |location = Sausalito CA }}</ref>\n: <math> \\mathbf{a} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} + 2\\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t}-\\rho \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho}\\left( \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)^2 + \\rho \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\ , </math>\n:: <math> = \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\left[ \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\rho }{\\mathrm{d}t^2}-\\rho\\left( \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)^2 \\right] + \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}\\left[ 2\\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\rho}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t} + \\rho \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\right] \\ </math>\n:: <math> = \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\left[ \\frac {\\mathrm{d}v_{\\rho}}{\\mathrm{d}t}-\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{\\rho}\\right] + \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}\\left[ \\frac{2}{\\rho}v_{\\rho} v_{\\theta} + \\rho\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{v_{\\theta}}{\\rho}\\right] \\ .</math>\n\nAs a particular example, if the particle moves in a circle of constant radius ''R'', then d''\u03c1''/d''t'' = 0, '''v''' = '''v'''<sub>\u03b8</sub>, and:\n\n:: <math>\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\left[ -\\rho\\left( \\frac {\\mathrm{d} \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)^2 \\right] + \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}\\left[ \\rho \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^2 \\theta} {\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\right] \\ </math>\n::: <math> = \\mathbf{u}_{\\rho} \\left[ -\\frac{v^2}{r}\\right] + \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}\\left[ \\frac {\\mathrm{d} v} {\\mathrm{d}t}\\right] \\ </math>\n\nwhere <math> v = v_{\\theta}. </math>\n\nThese results agree with those above for [[Centripetal force#Nonuniform circular motion|nonuniform circular motion]].

Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on [[Curvature#Local expressions|curvature]].\n\nTo introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In terms of arc length ''s'', let the path be described as:<ref name = curvature>The article on [[curvature]] treats a more general case where the curve is parametrized by an arbitrary variable (denoted ''t''), rather than by the arc length ''s''.</ref>\n: <math>\\mathbf{r}(s) = \\left[ x(s),\\ y(s) \\right] \\ . </math>\n\nThen an incremental displacement along the path d''s'' is described by:\n: <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}(s) = \\left[ \\mathrm{d}x(s),\\ \\mathrm{d}y(s) \\right] = \\left[ x'(s),\\ y'(s) \\right] \\mathrm{d}s \\ , </math>\n\nwhere primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to ''s''. The magnitude of this displacement is d''s'', showing that:<ref name = Shabana>{{cite book |title = Railroad Vehicle Dynamics: A Computational Approach |author1=Ahmed A. Shabana |author2=Khaled E.

The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]. Using the tangent vector, the angle ''\u03b8'' of the tangent to the curve is given by:\n: <math>\\sin \\theta = \\frac{y'(s)}{\\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = y'(s) \\ ;</math> and <math>\\cos \\theta = \\frac{x'(s)}{\\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}} = x'(s) \\ .</math>\n\nThe radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:\n: <math>\\frac{1}{\\rho} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}s}\\ . </math>\n\nThe derivative of ''\u03b8'' can be found from that for sin''\u03b8'':\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\sin\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\cos \\theta \\frac {\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\cos \\theta \\ = \\frac{1}{\\rho} x'(s)\\ . </math>\n\nNow:\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\sin \\theta }{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\frac{y'(s)}{\\sqrt{x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2}}</math> <math> = \\frac{y''(s)x'(s)^2-y'(s)x'(s)x''(s)} {\\left(x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2\\right)^{3/2}}\\ , </math>\n\nin which the denominator is unity. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:\n: <math>\\frac {\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} = y''(s)x'(s) - y'(s)x''(s)\\ </math>\u2002<math> = \\frac{y''(s)}{x'(s)} = -\\frac{x''(s)}{y'(s)} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of [[#Eq. 1|Eq. 1]]:\n: <math>x'(s)x''(s) + y'(s)y''(s) = 0 \\ . </math>\nWith these results, the acceleration can be found:\n: <math>\\mathbf{a}(s) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{v}(s) </math> <math> = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( x'(s), \\ y'(s) \\right) \\right]\\ </math>\n:: <math> = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2s}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\right)\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) + \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) ^2 \\left(x''(s),\\ y''(s) \\right) </math>\n:: <math> = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2s}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\right)\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) - \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) ^2 \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s) \\ , </math>\nas can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors '''u'''<sub>t</sub>(''s'') and '''u'''<sub>n</sub>(''s''). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius ''\u03c1''. Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force. From a qualitative standpoint, the path can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius.\n\nThis result for acceleration agrees with that found earlier. However, in this approach, the question of the change in radius of curvature with ''s'' is handled completely formally, consistent with a geometric interpretation, but not relying upon it, thereby avoiding any questions the image above might suggest about neglecting the variation in ''\u03c1''.\n{{anchor|circular_motion}}\n\n===== Example: circular motion =====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo illustrate the above formulas, let ''x'', ''y'' be given as:\n: <math>x = \\alpha \\cos \\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ ; \\ y = \\alpha \\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ .</math>\n\nThen:\n: <math>x^2 + y^2 = \\alpha^2 \\ , </math>\n\nwhich can be recognized as a circular path around the origin with radius ''\u03b1''. The position ''s'' = 0 corresponds to [''\u03b1'', 0], or 3 o'clock. To use the above formalism, the derivatives are needed:\n\n: <math>y^{\\prime}(s) = \\cos \\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ ; \\ x^{\\prime}(s) = -\\sin \\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ , </math>\n: <math>y^{\\prime\\prime}(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ ; \\ x^{\\prime\\prime}(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\cos \\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ . </math>\n\nWith these results, one can verify that:\n: <math> x^{\\prime}(s)^2 + y^{\\prime}(s)^2 = 1 \\ ; \\ \\frac{1}{\\rho} = y^{\\prime\\prime}(s)x^{\\prime}(s)-y^{\\prime}(s)x^{\\prime\\prime}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ . </math>\n\nThe unit vectors can also be found:\n: <math>\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) = \\left[-\\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ , \\ \\cos\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\right] \\ ; \\ \\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s) = \\left[\\cos\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ , \\ \\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\right] \\ , </math>\n\nwhich serve to show that ''s'' = 0 is located at position [''\u03c1'', 0] and ''s'' = ''\u03c1''\u03c0/2 at [0, ''\u03c1''], which agrees with the original expressions for ''x'' and ''y''. In other words, ''s'' is measured counterclockwise around the circle from 3 o'clock. Also, the derivatives of these vectors can be found:\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}s}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left[\\cos\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ , \\ \\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s) \\ ; </math>\n: <math> \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}s}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left[-\\sin\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\ , \\ \\cos\\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) \\ . </math>\n\nTo obtain velocity and acceleration, a time-dependence for ''s'' is necessary. For counterclockwise motion at variable speed ''v''(''t''):\n: <math>s(t) = \\int_0^t \\ dt^{\\prime} \\ v(t^{\\prime}) \\ , </math>\nwhere ''v''(''t'') is the speed and ''t'' is time, and ''s''(''t'' = 0) = 0. Then:\n: <math>\\mathbf{v} = v(t)\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) \\ ,</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) + v\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s)-v\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}t} </math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{t}(s)-\\frac{v^2}{\\alpha}\\mathbf{u}_\\mathrm{n}(s) \\ , </math>\nwhere it already is established that \u03b1 = \u03c1. This acceleration is the standard result for [[non-uniform circular motion]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n* [[Central force]]\n* [[Fictitious force]]\n* [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal force]]\n* [[Circular motion]]\n* [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]]\n* [[Reactive centrifugal force]]\n* [[Bertrand theorem]]\n{{Col-2-of-3}}\n* [[Time derivative#Example: circular motion|Example: circular motion]]\n* [[Mechanics of planar particle motion]]\n* [[Frenet-Serret formulas]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Statics]]\n* [[kinetics (physics)|Kinetics]]\n* [[Eskimo yo-yo]]\n{{Col-3-of-3}}\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[History of centrifugal and centripetal forces]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Serway, Raymond A. |author2=Jewett, John W. | title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers\n| edition = 6th\n| publisher = Brooks/Cole\n| year= 2004\n| isbn = 978-0-534-40842-8\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| author = Tipler, Paul\n| title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics\n| edition = 5th\n| publisher = W.

It is usually applied to an installation file after it is received from the download server.  By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data [[authentication|authenticity]].\n\nThe actual [[algorithm|procedure]] which yields the checksum from a data input is called a '''checksum function''' or '''[[checksum algorithm]]'''. Depending on its design goals, a good checksum algorithm will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input. This is especially true of [[cryptographic hash function]]s, which may be used to detect many data corruption errors and verify overall [[data integrity]]; if the computed checksum for the current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum, there is a very high probability the data has not been accidentally altered or corrupted.\n\nChecksum functions are related to [[hash function]]s, [[fingerprint (computing)|fingerprint]]s, [[randomization function]]s, and [[cryptographic hash function]]s.  However, each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals. For instance, a function returning the start of a string can provide a hash appropriate for some applications but will never be a suitable checksum. Checksums are used as [[Cryptographic_primitive|cryptographic primitives]] in larger authentication algorithms. For cryptographic systems with these two specific design goals, see [[Hash-based message authentication code|HMAC]].\n\n[[Check digit]]s and [[parity bit]]s are special cases of checksums, appropriate for small blocks of data (such as [[Social Security number]]s, [[bank account]] numbers, [[Word (data type)|computer word]]s, single [[byte]]s, etc.).  Some [[error-correcting code]]s are based on special checksums which not only detect common errors but also allow the original data to be recovered in certain cases.\n\n==Algorithms==\n===Parity byte or parity word===\nThe simplest checksum algorithm is the so-called [[longitudinal redundancy check|longitudinal parity check]], which breaks the data into \"words\" with a fixed number ''n'' of bits, and then computes the [[exclusive or]] (XOR) of all those words.  The result is appended to the message as an extra word. To check the integrity of a message, the receiver computes the exclusive or of all its words, including the checksum; if the result is not a word consisting of ''n'' zeros, the receiver knows a transmission error occurred.\n\nWith this checksum, any transmission error which flips a single bit of the message, or an odd number of bits, will be detected as an incorrect checksum.  However, an error which affects two bits will not be detected if those bits lie at the same position in two distinct words.  Also swapping of two or more words will not be detected. If the affected bits are independently chosen at random, the probability of a two-bit error being undetected is 1/''n''.\n\n===Modular sum===\n\nA variant of the previous algorithm is to add all the \"words\" as unsigned binary numbers, discarding any overflow bits, and append the [[two's complement]] of the total as the checksum.  To validate a message, the receiver adds all the words in the same manner, including the checksum; if the result is not a word full of zeros, an error must have occurred.  This variant too detects any single-bit error, but the promodular sum is used in [[J1708|SAE J1708]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvaser.com/zh/about-can/related-protocols-and-standards/50.html |title=SAE J1708 |publisher=Kvaser.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211152639/http://www.kvaser.com/zh/about-can/related-protocols-and-standards/50.html |archivedate={{date|2013-12-11}} }}</ref>\n\n===Position-dependent===\n\nThe simple checksums described above fail to detect some common errors which affect many bits at once, such as changing the order of data words, or inserting or deleting words with all bits set to zero.  The checksum algorithms most used in practice, such as [[Fletcher's checksum]], [[Adler-32]], and [[cyclic redundancy check]]s (CRCs), address these weaknesses by considering not only the value of each word but also its position in the sequence. This feature generally increases the [[Analysis of algorithms|cost]] of computing the checksum.\n\n===General considerations===\n\nA message that is ''m'' bits long can be viewed as a corner of the ''m''-dimensional hypercube. The effect of a checksum algorithm that yields an n-bit checksum is to map each ''m''-bit message to a corner of a larger hypercube, with dimension {{tmath|m+n}}. The 2<sup>''m''+''n''</sup> corners of this hypercube represent all possible received messages. The valid received messages (those that have the correct checksum) comprise a smaller set, with only 2<sup>''m''</sup> corners.\n\nA single-bit transmission error then corresponds to a displacement from a valid corner (the correct message and checksum) to one of the ''m'' adjacent corners.  An error which affects ''k'' bits moves the message to a corner which is ''k'' steps removed from its correct corner.  The goal of a good checksum algorithm is to spread the valid corners as far from each other as possible, so as to increase the likelihood \"typical\" transmission errors will end up in an invalid corner.\n\n==See also==\n\nGeneral topic\n* [[Algorithm]]\n* [[Check digit]]\n* [[Damm algorithm]]\n* [[Data rot]]\n* [[File verification]]\n* [[Fletcher's checksum]]\n* [[Frame check sequence]]\n* [[cksum]]\n* [[md5sum]]\n* [[sha1sum]]\n* [[Parchive]]\n* [[Sum (Unix)|sum]]\n* [[SYSV checksum]]\n* [[BSD checksum]]\n* [[xxHash]]\n\nError correction\n* [[Hamming code]]\n* [[IPv4 header checksum]]\n\nHash functions\n* [[List of hash functions]]\n* [[Luhn algorithm]]\n* [[Parity bit]]\n* [[Rolling checksum]]\n* [[Verhoeff algorithm]]\n* [[ZFS]]&nbsp;\u2014 a file system which performs automatic file integrity checking using checksums\n\nRelated concepts\n*[[Isopsephy]]\n*[[Gematria]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks\n |1= Algorithm Implementation\n |2= Checksums\n}}\n*[http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/Additive-Checksums Additive Checksums (C)] theory from Barr Group\n\n[[Category:Checksum algorithms|*]]", "sha1": "rgkzufy53kdn2eo6pqpq76ew3amoxow"}}, {"title": "Cosmic Background Radiation", "ns": "0", "id": "7539", "redirect": {"title": "Cosmic background radiation"}, "revision": {"id": "779790386", "parentid": "573268436", "timestamp": "2017-05-11T00:45:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "GeoffreyT2000", "id": "21491290"}, "comment": "[[WP:AES|\u2190]]Redirected page to [[Cosmic background radiation]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Cosmic background radiation]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from move}}\n{{R from other capitalization}}\n}}", "sha1": "3hn76an8ezvust8n6lv6yq7dgzozhok"}}, {"title": "Cultural evolution (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "7540", "revision": {"id": "760615223", "parentid": "746304272", "timestamp": "2017-01-18T02:03:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Prisencolin", "id": "20834545"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''[[Cultural evolution]]''' is [[cultural change]] viewed from an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]].\n\nIt may also refer to:\n* [[Cultural selection theory]], studies of cultural change modelled on [[evolutionary biology]]\n* [[Dual inheritance theory|Dual-inheritance theory]], a specific framework for studying cultural evolution\n* [[Memetics]], neo-Darwinist view of the transmission of cultural traits\n* [[Social evolution]], the evolution of social behaviour\n* [[Sociocultural evolution]], a historic theory of social change based on [[Social progress|linear progress]] \n\n==See also==\n* [[Cultural revolution]]\n\n{{Disambiguation}}", "sha1": "cyk8jfv1kpayute8mtemmvd06tksu0w"}}, {"title": "City University of New York", "ns": "0", "id": "7541", "revision": {"id": "865248152", "parentid": "865248112", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T18:17:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "JesseRafe", "id": "641784"}, "comment": "/* top */ typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|\"CUNY,\" the public university of the City of New York|a list of universities in New York|Universities in New York|the state university system in New York |State University of New York|the private university|New York University|the surname|Cuny (surname)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2015}}{{Infobox University\n| image = Seal_of_the_City_University_of_New_York_(CUNY).png \n| image_size = 150px\n| name = The City University of New York\n|motto       = {{lang-la|Eruditio populi liberi spes gentium}}\n|mottoeng    = The education of free people is the hope of humanity<ref name=facts>{{cite web |url=http://www2.cuny.edu/about/trustees/history/ |title=History of the Board |publisher=City University of New York |accessdate=2018-03-19 }}</ref> \n| budget = $3.0&nbsp;billion<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/bf/ubd/faqs.html |title=University Budget Office FAQ's \u2013 Budget & Finance \u2013 CUNY |website=Cuny.edu |accessdate=2014-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423052150/http://cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/bf/ubd/faqs.html |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| established = 1961<ref>The forerunner of today's City University of New York was founded in 1847, but the actual system was established in 1961.</ref>\n| type = [[Public university|Public]] [[university system]]\n| chancellor = Vita C.

The legislation\nintegrated existing institutions and a new graduate school into a coordinated system of higher education for the city, under the control of the \"Board of Higher Education of the City of New York\", which had been created by New York State legislation in 1926. By 1979, the Board of Higher Education had become the \"Board of Trustees of the CUNY\".<ref name=fitzp />\n\nThe institutions that were merged in order to create CUNY were:<ref name=fitzp />\n\n* The Free Academy \u2013 Founded in 1847 by [[Townsend Harris]], it was fashioned as \"a Free Academy for the purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the city and county of New York.\" The Free Academy later became the [[City College of New York]].\n* The Female Normal and High School \u2013 Founded in 1870, and later renamed [[Normal school|the Normal College]]. It would be renamed again in 1914 to [[Hunter College]]. During the early 20th century, Hunter College expanded into the Bronx, with what became [[Lehman College|Herbert Lehman College]].<ref name=fitzp>Fitzpatrick, John.

Its four-year colleges offered a high quality, tuition-free education to the poor, the working class and the immigrants of New York City who met the grade requirements for matriculated status. During the post-[[World War I]] era, when some [[Ivy League]] universities, such as [[Yale University]], discriminated against [[Jews]], many Jewish academics and intellectuals studied and taught at CUNY.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oren|first=Dan A.|title=Joining the Club: A History of Jews at Yale|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref> The City College of New York developed a reputation of being \"the [[Harvard]] of the proletariat.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Fullinwider|first=Robert K.|title=Leveling the Playing Field: Justice, Politics, and College Admissions|year=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|author2=Judith Lichtenberg}}</ref>\n\nAs New York City's population\u2014and public college enrollment\u2014grew during the early 20th century and the city struggled for resources, the municipal colleges slowly began adopting selective tuition, also known as instructional fees, for a handful of courses and programs. During the [[Great Depression]], with funding for the public colleges severely constrained, limits were imposed on the size of the colleges' free Day Session, and tuition was imposed upon students deemed \"competent\" but not academically qualified for the day program.  Most of these \"limited matriculation\" students enrolled in the Evening Session, and paid tuition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neumann|first=Florence Margaret|title=Access to Free Public Higher Education in New York City: 1847\u20131961|year=1984|publisher=PhD Dissertation, Graduate Faculty in Sociology, The City University of New York}}</ref>\n\nDemand in the United States for higher education rapidly grew after [[World War II]], and during the mid-1940s a movement began to create [[community college]]s to provide accessible education and training. In New York City, however, the community-college movement was constrained by many factors including \"financial problems, narrow perceptions of responsibility, organizational weaknesses, adverse political factors, and another competing priorities.\"<ref name=\"Gordon 1975\"/>\n\nCommunity colleges would have drawn from the same city coffers that were funding the senior colleges, and city higher education officials were of the view that the state should finance them. It wasn't until 1955, under a shared-funding arrangement with New York State, that New York City established its first community college, on Staten Island. Unlike the day college students attending the city's public baccalaureate colleges for free, the community college students had to pay tuition fees under the state-city funding formula. Community college students paid tuition fees for approximately 10 years.<ref name=\"Gordon 1975\"/>\n\nOver time, tuition fees for limited-matriculated students became an important source of system revenues. In fall 1957, for example, nearly 36,000 attended Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and City Colleges for free, but another 24,000 paid tuition fees of up to $300 a year \u2013 the equivalent of $2,413 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' online inflation calculator|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm}}</ref>  Undergraduate tuition and other student fees in 1957 comprised 17 percent of the colleges' $46.8 million in revenues, about $7.74 million \u2014 a figure equivalent to $62.4 million in 2011 buying power.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Board of Higher Education of the City of New York|title=Report of the Chairman|year=1959|issue=1957\u20131959|pages=86\u201387}}</ref>\n\nThree community colleges had been established by early 1961, when New York City's public colleges were codified by the state as a single university with a chancellor at the helm and an infusion of state funds. But the city's slowness in creating the community colleges as demand for college seats was intensifying, had resulted in mounting frustration, particularly on the part of minorities, that college opportunities were not available to them.\n\nIn 1964, as New York City's Board of Higher Education moved to take full responsibility for the community colleges, city officials extended the senior colleges' free tuition policy to them, a change that was included by Mayor [[Robert Wagner]] in his budget plans and took effect with the 1964\u201365 academic year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Board of Higher Education of the City of New York|title=Board of Higher Education Minutes of Proceedings|date= April 20, 1964|issue=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, a group of [[Black people|Black]] and [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] students occupied City College demanding the [[racial integration]] of CUNY, which at the time had an overwhelmingly [[white people|white]] student body.<ref name=\"Gordon 1975\">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Sheila|title=The Transformation of the City University of New York, 1945\u20131970|year=1975|publisher=PhD Dissertation, Columbia University|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Student protests===\nStudents at some campuses became increasingly frustrated with the university's and Board of Higher Education's handling of university administration.

Members of the Board of Education, chaired by the President of the board, served as ''ex officio'' trustees.  For the next four decades, the board members continued to serve as ''ex officio'' trustees of the College of the City of New York and the city's other municipal college, the Normal College of the City of New York.\n\nIn 1900, the New York State Legislature created separate boards of trustees for the College of the City of New York and the Normal College, which became Hunter College in 1914.  In 1926, the Legislature established the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, which assumed supervision of both municipal colleges.\n\nIn 1961, the New York State Legislature established the City University of New York, uniting what had become seven municipal colleges at the time: the City College of New York, Hunter College, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Staten Island Community College, Bronx Community College and Queensborough Community College. In 1979, the CUNY Financing and Governance Act was adopted by the State and the Board of Higher Education became the City University of New York Board of Trustees.\n\nToday, the City University is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of 17 members, ten of whom are appointed by the [[Governor of New York]] \"with the advice and consent of the senate,\" and five by the [[Mayor of New York City]] \"with the advice and consent of the senate.\" The final two trustees are ''ex officio'' members. One is the chair of the university's student senate, and the other is non-voting and is the chair of the university's faculty senate. Both the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to include at least one resident of each of New York City's five boroughs. Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years. The Chancellor is elected by the Board of Trustees, and is the \"chief educational and administrative officer\" of the City University.\n\nThe administrative offices are in [[Midtown Manhattan]].<ref>\"[http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices.html Administrative Offices].\" City University of New York.

The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying their [[computational complexity]], i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The [[P versus NP problem]], one of the seven [[Millenium Prize Problems]], is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.<ref>{{cite web |title=P vs NP Problem {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem |website=www.claymath.org |language=en}}</ref> \n\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.\n\n==Computational problems==\n[[Image:TSP Deutschland 3.png|thumb|333px|A traveling salesman tour through Germany's 15 largest cities.]]\n\n===Problem instances===\nA [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is \"no\"). Stated another way, the ''instance'' is a particular input to the problem, and the ''solution'' is the output corresponding to the given input.\n\nTo further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.\n\n===Representing problem instances===\nWhen considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world [[computer]], mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.\n\nEven though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.\n\n===Decision problems as formal languages===\n[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]\n[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.\n\nAn example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs \u2014 to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.\n\n===Function problems===\nA [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]]\u2014that is, the output isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].\n\nIt is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.\n\n===Measuring the size of an instance===\nTo measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?\n\nIf the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.\n\n==Machine models and complexity measures==\n\n===Turing machine===\n[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of a Turing machine]]\n{{main|Turing machine}}\nA Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.\n\nMany types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.\n\nA deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[non-deterministic algorithm]].\n\n===Other machine models===\nMany machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.<ref>See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}</ref> What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].\n\nHowever, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[non-deterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.\n\n===Complexity measures===\nFor a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).\n\nAnalogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[Complexity|complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].\n\nThe complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using [[big O notation]].\n\n===Best, worst and average case complexity===\n[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] <math>\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)</math>.]]\nThe [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:\n*Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.\n*Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.\n*Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.\n\nFor example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time [[Big O notation|O]](''n''<sup>2</sup>) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.\n\n===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===\nTo classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase \"all possible algorithms\" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').\n\nUpper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big O notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;7''n''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;15''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;40, in big O notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;O(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\n==Complexity classes==\n{{main|Complexity class}}\n\n===Defining complexity classes===\nA '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:\n* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nSome complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:\n\n:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)\n\nBut bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].\n\n===Important complexity classes===\n\n[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|250px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]\nMany important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n{|\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Complexity class\n!

[[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.\n\n===Hierarchy theorems===\n{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}\nFor the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathsf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathsf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathsf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathsf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.\n\n===Reduction===\n{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&nbsp;=&nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>. This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&nbsp;=&nbsp;NP.<ref name=\"Sipser2006\"/>\n\n==Important open problems==\n[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;NP.

This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]].

An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP-complete''', or NP-intermediate.

Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''co-NP''' (and even in UP and co-UP<ref>[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html</ref>). If the problem is '''NP-complete''', the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' will equal '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time <math>O(e^{\\left(\\frac{64}{9}\\right)^{1/3}(\\log n)^{1/3}(\\log \\log n)^{2/3}})</math><ref>Wolfram MathWorld: [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html Number Field Sieve]</ref> to factor an integer ''n''. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\n\n===Separations between other complexity classes===\nMany known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance '''P''' \u2286 '''NP''' \u2286 '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' \u2286 '''PSPACE''', but it is possible that '''P''' = '''PSPACE'''. If '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', then '''P''' is not equal to '''PSPACE''' either. Since there are many known complexity classes between '''P''' and '''PSPACE''', such as '''RP''', '''BPP''', '''PP''', '''BQP''', '''MA''', '''PH''', etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.\n\nAlong the same lines, '''[[co-NP]]''' is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of '''NP''' problems. It is believed<ref>[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]</ref> that '''NP''' is not equal to '''co-NP'''; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', since if '''P'''='''NP''' we would also have '''P'''='''co-NP''', since problems in '''NP''' are dual to those in '''co-NP'''.\n\nSimilarly, it is not known if '''L''' (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in '''P''' or equal to '''P'''. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as '''NL''' and '''NC''', and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.\n\nIt is suspected that '''P''' and '''BPP''' are equal. However, it is currently open if '''BPP''' = '''NEXP'''.\n\n==Intractability== <!-- This section is linked from [[Minimax]], [[Intractability]], [[Intractable]] -->\n{{See also|Combinatorial explosion}}\n{{wikt|tractable|feasible|intractability|infeasible}}\nA problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice ''any'' solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an '''{{visible anchor|intractable problem}}'''.<ref>Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D.

Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then [[NP-hard]] problems are also intractable in this sense.\n\nHowever, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].\n\nTo see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2<sup>''n''</sup> operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10<sup>12</sup> operations each second, the program would run for about 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>10</sup> years, which is the same order of magnitude as the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001<sup>''n''</sup> operations is practical until ''n'' gets relatively large.\n\nSimilarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''<sup>15</sup>, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even ''n''<sup>3</sup> or ''n''<sup>2</sup> algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.\n\n==History==\nAn early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] done by [[Gabriel Lam\u00e9]] in 1844.\n\nBefore the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.\n\nThe beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]], which laid out the definitions of [[time complexity]] and [[space complexity]], and proved the hierarchy theorems.<ref name=\"Fortnow 2003\">{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}</ref> In addition, in 1965 [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] suggested to consider a \"good\" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.<ref>Richard M.

The field began to flourish in 1971 when the [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Leonid Levin]] [[Cook\u2013Levin theorem|proved]] the existence of practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\", in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.<ref>{{Citation | author = Richard M.

At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was widely believed that if a problem turned out to be NP-complete, then there was little chance of being able to work with the problem in a practical situation. However, it became increasingly clear that this is not always the case, and some authors claimed that general asymptotic results are often unimportant for typical problems arising in practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1143|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[:Category:Computational problems]]\n* [[Context of computational complexity]]\n* [[Descriptive complexity theory]]\n* [[Game complexity]]\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n* [[List of computability and complexity topics]]\n* [[List of important publications in theoretical computer science]]\n* [[List of unsolved problems in computer science]]\n* [[Parameterized complexity]]\n* [[Proof complexity]]\n* [[Quantum complexity theory]]\n* [[Structural complexity theory]]\n* [[Transcomputational problem]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Textbooks===\n*{{Citation\n| last1=Arora | first1=Sanjeev | authorlink1=Sanjeev Arora\n| last2=Barak | first2=Boaz\n| title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach\n| url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]]\n| year=2009\n| isbn=978-0-521-42426-4\n| zbl=1193.68112\n}}\n* {{Citation\n| last1=Downey\n| first1=Rod\n| last2=Fellows\n| first2=Michael\n| authorlink2=Michael Fellows\n| title=Parameterized complexity\n| url=https://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-0-22-1519914-0,00.html?referer=www.springer.de%2Fcgi-bin%2Fsearch_book.pl%3Fisbn%3D0-387-94883-X\n| publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]\n| location=Berlin, New York\n| year=1999\n}}\n* {{citation\n| last=Du\n| first=Ding-Zhu\n| author2=Ko, Ker-I\n| title=Theory of Computational Complexity\n| publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n| year=2000\n| isbn=978-0-471-34506-0\n}}\n* {{Garey-Johnson}}\n* {{Citation\n| last=Goldreich\n| first=Oded\n| authorlink=Oded Goldreich\n| url = http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/cc-book.html\n| title = Computational Complexity: A Conceptual Perspective\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| year = 2008\n}}\n* {{Citation\n| editor1-last=van Leeuwen\n| editor1-first=Jan\n| editor1-link = Jan van Leeuwen\n| title=Handbook of theoretical computer science (vol.

Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. \n\nThe stories locate it somewhere in [[Great Britain]] and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for [[chivalric romance]] writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the \"real Camelot\" have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe name's derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romance, including: ''Camaalot'', ''Camalot'', ''Chamalot'', ''Camehelot'' (sometimes read as ''Camchilot''), ''Camaaloth'', ''Caamalot'', ''Camahaloth'', ''Camaelot'', ''Kamaalot'', ''Kamaaloth'', ''Kaamalot'', ''Kamahaloth'', ''Kameloth'', ''Kamaelot'', ''Kamelot'', ''Kaamelot'', ''Cameloth'', ''Camelot'' and ''Gamalaot''.<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\">Loomis, Roger Sherman, Arthurian tradition & Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Columbia University Press, 1961, p. 480.</ref><ref>Sommer, Heinrich Oskar, The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances: Lestoire de Merlin, Carnegie Institution, 1916, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\">Brugger, Ernst, \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Erkl\u00e4rung der arthurischen Geographie\", in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr franz\u00f6sische Sprache und Literatur, Volume 28, 1905, pp. 1-71.</ref> Arthurian scholar [[Ernst Brugger]] suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthur's final battle, the [[Battle of Camlann]], in Welsh tradition.<ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\"/> [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] believed it was derived from ''Cavalon'', a place name that he suggested was a corruption of [[Avalon]] (under the influence of the Breton place name ''Cavallon''). He further suggested that ''Cavalon/Camelot'' became Arthur's capital due to confusion with Arthur's other traditional court at ''Carlion'' (''Caer Lleon'' in Welsh).<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\"/>\n\nOthers have suggested a derivation from the [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] place name ''[[Camulodunum]]'', one of the first capitals of [[Roman Britain]] and which would have significance in [[Romano-British culture]]. Indeed, [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]], the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the [[Roman Empire]] and the history of [[Sub-Roman Britain]], suggested in his book ''The Age of Arthur'' that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name \"Camelot\" of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of [[Britannia]]  (''[[Camulodunum]]'', modern [[Colchester]]) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] would have encountered the name ''Camulodunum'', or why he would render it as ''Camaalot'', though Urban T. Holmes argued in 1929 that Chretien had access to Book 2 of [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], where it is rendered as \"Camaloduno\".<ref>Nitze, William A. et al.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1937.</ref> Given Chr\u00e9tien's known tendency to create new stories and characters, being the first to mention the hero [[Lancelot]]'s love affair with Queen [[Guinevere]] for example, the name might also be entirely invented.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/>\n\n== Early appearances ==\nArthur's court at Camelot is mentioned for the first time in Chr\u00e9tien's poem ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts. In the C manuscript (Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, fonds fran\u00e7ais 794, folio 27r), which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretien's original text,<ref>Wolfgang, Lenora D., \"Chretien's Lancelot: Love and Philology,\" Reading Medieval Studies, 17 (1991), pp. 3-17 (pp. 11-12).</ref> instead of the place name we find the [[Old French]] phrase ''con lui plot'', meaning \"as he pleased\". The other manuscripts spell the name variously as ''Chamalot'' (MS A, f. f. 196r), ''Camehelot'' (MS E, f. 1r), ''Chamaalot'' (MS G, f. 34f), and ''Camalot'' [MS T, f. 41v]; the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V [Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725]).<ref name=\"Lacy\"/><ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cammenu.htm \"Camelot\"].

For Chr\u00e9tien, Arthur's chief court was in [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]]; this was the king's primary base in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and subsequent literature.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Chr\u00e9tien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles. \n\nIt is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. One exception is ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which locates Arthur's court at \"Camelot\";<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 37.</ref> however, in Britain, Arthur's court was generally located at Caerleon, or at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which is usually identified with the \"Carduel\" of the French romances.<ref>Ashley, pp. 612-3.</ref>\n\nIn the late 15th century, [[Thomas Malory]] created the image of Camelot most familiar to English speakers today in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', a work based mostly on the French romances. He firmly identifies Camelot with [[Winchester]] in England, an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, [[William Caxton]], who preferred a Welsh location.<ref name=\"Caxton\">Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', p. xvii.</ref>\n\n== Description in the romances ==\n[[File:The Great Hall, Camelot, Act IV.png|thumb|The Great Hall of Camelot in a scene painting [[Hawes Craven]] (1895)]]\n\nThe Lancelot-Grail Cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from [[Astolat]]. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen's]], is the religious centre for Arthur's Knights of the [[Round Table]]. There, Arthur and Guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the Round Table; it is here that [[Galahad]] conquers the [[Siege Perilous]], and where the knights see a vision of the [[Holy Grail]] and swear to find it. Jousts are held in a meadow outside the city. \n\nIn the [[Palamedes (romance)|''Palamedes'']] and other works, the castle is eventually destroyed by King [[Mark of Cornwall]] after the loss of Arthur at the Battle of Camlann.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> However maddening to later scholars searching for Camelot's location, its imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur's court and universe.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> There is a Kamaalot featured as the home of Perceval's mother in the romance ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/bruce_dictionary/index_k.htm|title=Arthurian Name Dictionary|website=www.celtic-twilight.com|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102212201/http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/bruce_dictionary/index_k.htm|archivedate=2015-01-02|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe romancers' versions of Camelot drew on earlier descriptions of Arthur's fabulous court. From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in [[Celliwig]], an uncertain locale in [[Cornwall]]. \n\nAlthough the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the [[Welsh Triads]] agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the [[Celtic Britons]]: [[Cornwall]], Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd]]. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as [[Arthur's Seat]], indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as [[Brittany]]. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location.<ref name=\"Cadbury\">[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]] (1991). \"Topography and Local Legends\". In Norris J.

Lacy]] commented that \"Camelot, located no where in particular, can be anywhere.\"<ref name=\"Lacy\">[[Norris J. Lacy|Lacy, Norris J.]] (1991). \"Camelot\". In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 66\u201367. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.</ref> The romancers' versions of Camelot draw on earlier traditions of Arthur's fabulous court. The Celliwig of ''Culhwch and Olwen'' appears in the Welsh Triads as well; this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of Caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its impressive Roman ruins; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (''Perlesvaus'', the Didot ''Perceval'' attributed to [[Robert de Boron]], and even the early romances of Chr\u00e9tien such as ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' and ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'') have Arthur hold court at \"Carduel in Wales,\" a northern city based on the real Carlisle. Malory's identification of Camelot as Winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history: it had been the capital of [[Wessex]] under [[Alfred the Great]], and boasted the [[Winchester Round Table]], an artifact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Caxton rejected the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at [[Caerwent]].<ref name=\"Caxton\"/>\n\n[[File:Somerset cadbury castle modified.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]] site in 2006]]\n\nIn 1542, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported the locals around [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]], formerly known as Camalet,<ref name=rev>Phelps, W.

Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.\n\nThe name of the Romano-British town of Camulodunum in [[Essex]] was derived from the Celtic god [[Camulus]]. However, it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by Saxons, so it is unlikely to have been the location of any \"true\" Camelot. The town was definitely known as Colchester as early as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/badger/placenames.htm|title=Place Names|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Even [[Colchester Castle|Colchester Museum]] argues strongly regarding the historical Arthur: \"It would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the Colchester area, or to Essex more generally,\" pointing out that the connection between the name Camulodunum and Colchester was unknown until the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.camulos.com/arthur/official.htm Official Response to linking Arthur and Colchester]</ref> Professor Peter Fields has suggested that another Camulodunum, a former Roman fort, is a likely location of King Arthur's Camelot<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-38330272|title=Professor reveals 'the true Camelot'|date=18 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> and that \"Slack, on the outskirts of [[Huddersfield]] in [[West Yorkshire]],\" is where Arthur would have held court. This is because of the name, and also regarding its strategic location: it is but a few miles from the extreme South-West of [[Hen Ogledd]] (also making close to [[North Wales]]), and would have been a great flagship point in starving off attacks to the Celtic kingdoms from both the [[Angles]] and other attackers. Other places in Britain with names related to \"Camel\" have also been suggested, such as [[Camelford]] in Cornwall, located down the [[River Camel]] from where Geoffrey places [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]], the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. Further north [[Camelon]] and its connections with [[Arthur's O'on]] have been mentioned in relation to Camelot, but Camelon may be an [[antiquarian]] [[neologism]] coined after the 15th century, with its earlier name being ''Carmore'' or ''Carmure''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibb|first1=Alexander|title=The Stirling Antiquary: Reprinted from \"The Stirling Sentinel,\" 1888-[1906].|date=1904|publisher=Cook & Wylie|location=Stirling|pages=349-365|url=https://archive.org/stream/stirlingantiqua01unkngoog#page/n361/mode/2up/search/camelon|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Later uses ==\nCamelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the Arthurian legend. The symbolism of Camelot so impressed [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the legend.<ref>Staines, David (1991). \"Alfred, Lord Tennyson\". In Norris J. Lacy (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 446\u2013449. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.</ref>\n\nModern stories typically retain Camelot's lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the Arthurian world, though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a [[High Middle Ages]] palace.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Some writers of the \"realist\" strain of modern Arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible Camelot. Inspired by Alcock's Cadbury-Camelot excavation, some authors such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] and [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]] place their Camelots in that place and describe it accordingly.<ref name=\"Cadbury\"/>\n\nCamelot lends its name to the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', which was adapted into a [[Camelot (film)|film of the same title]], featuring the Castle of [[Coca, Segovia]] as Camelot. An Arthurian television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' was also named after the castle, as were some other works including the video game ''[[Camelot (video game)|Camelot]]'' and the comic book series ''[[Camelot 3000]]''. French television series ''[[Kaamelott]]'' presents a humorous alternative version of the Arthurian legend; [[Camelot Theme Park]] is a now-abandoned Arthurian theme park resort located in the English county of [[Lancashire]].\n\nIn American contexts, Camelot refers to the presidency of [[John F. Kennedy]]. In a 1963 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' interview, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], his widow, referenced a line from the Lerner and Loewe musical to describe the Kennedy White House: \"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.\" She indicated that it was one of Kennedy's favorite lyrics from the musical and added, \"there'll be great Presidents again, but there'll never be another Camelot again.

Craig Venter Institute===\nVenter is currently the chief executive officer of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], a nonprofit which conducts research in [[synthetic biology]]. Venter founded the organization in 2006. It has facilities in La Jolla and in [[Rockville, Maryland]] and employs over 200 people.\n\n===Individual human genome===\nOn September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published the first complete (six-billion-letter) [[genome]] of an individual human\u2014Venter's own DNA sequence.<ref name=\"PloS_VG\">{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779|author2=Sutton G|author3=Ng PC|author4=Feuk L|author5=Halpern AL|display-authors=5|last6=Walenz|first6=Brian P.|last7=Axelrod|first7=Nelson|last8=Huang|first8=Jiaqi|last9=Kirkness|first9=Ewen F.}}</ref> Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=117800 Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> increased risk of antisocial behavior, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]].<ref name=\"Decoded\"/> This publication was especially interesting since it contained a [[diploid]] instead of a [[haploid]] genome and shows promise for [[personalized medicine]] via [[genotyping]].{{Original research inline|date=October 2009}} This genome, dubbed HuRef by Levy and others, was a landmark accomplishment.\n\nThe Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using [[microfluidic Sanger sequencing]], assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million [[Mutation|DNA variation]]s identified by genome analysis. These variants include [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), block [[point mutation|substitutions]], short and large [[indel]]s, and structural variations like [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[chromosome inversion|inversions]] and [[copy number variation|copy number changes]].\n\nThe browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[Ensembl]] annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the [[haplotype]] blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including [[dbSNP]], Ensembl, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO).\n\nUsers can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef [[contig]] or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.\n\n===Human Longevity, Inc.===\nOn March 4, 2014 Venter and co-founders [[Peter Diamandis]] and [[Hariri#Others|Robert Hariri]] announced the formation of [[Human Longevity]], Inc., a company focused on extending the healthy, \"high performance\" human lifespan.<ref name=\"PRNewswire\">{{cite news | title = Human Longevity Inc.

He will invariably be listed first or last. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CRITERION.\n(2) Be cited in a peer-reviewed scientific journal with an [[impact factor]] of at least 10.\n(3) It must have at least an average of 100 citations PER YEAR. If you are using ISIknowledge, just click on the number of times cited, then click on \"analyze results\", and rank by publication year. To calculate this manually, take the number of citations the article has (try using ISIknowledge.com) and divide it by the number of years since it was published. This rule is more flexible for articles published in the 20th century, as most can reasonably be expected not to be cited often anymore.\n\nExceptions to criteria 3 are:\n(1) his autobiography\n(2) an article that is a BIG DEAL but is too recent to have been so highly cited (for example, \"Environmental genome shotgun sequencing of the Sargasso Sea\" was a huge deal, but was only cited 60 times in 2004, a very low number for a Venter article)\n(3) a review, editorial, etc., that is often cited and that provides a broad overview OF HIS OWN WORKS.\n\nThe criteria may seem incredibly high, but they account for the fact that Venter's articles are hugely cited and WP is not a directory.\n-->\n<!--NOTE: the use of the ellipsis is prescribed by the [[APA]] when a work has more than 7 authors and a later one needs mentioning. For the purposes of this section (and with a modification so that it matches the output of citation templates), the first 7 authors are listed, followed by the spaced ellipsis, followed by the author (Venter), and, if necessary, followed by ''et al''.-->\n* {{Cite journal |author=Fleischmann, Robert D.|author2=Adams, Mark D.|author3=White, Owen|author4=Clayton, Rebecca|author5=. . .

Following an education in a strict religious and ethical environment as an [[altar boy]] at the [[vicarage]] of Jimpley, he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and an appreciation for the [[scientific method]] in a practical world. His first career choice was [[agriculture]], at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], where he was a part of the fraternity of Alpha Kappa Lambda, followed by history and then [[religion]]. At age 20, following his 1922 trip to [[Peking]], [[Republic of China|China]], for an international Christian conference, he started to doubt his religious convictions. To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled ''Why am I entering the Ministry?'', after which he decided to change his career. In 1924, he graduated from University of Wisconsin and enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)]]. He later became an atheist.<ref>Michael Martin (2007).

While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in child study. In 1930, Rogers served as director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940 he lectured at the [[University of Rochester]] and wrote ''The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child'' (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children.

In it, Rogers suggested that the client, by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life.\n\nIn 1945, he was invited to set up a counseling center at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1947 he was elected President of the American Psychological Association.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/past-presidents.aspx Former APA Presidents]</ref> While a professor of psychology at the [[University of Chicago]] (1945\u201357), Rogers helped to establish a counseling center connected with the university and there conducted studies to determine the effectiveness of his methods. His findings and theories appeared in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' (1951) and ''Psychotherapy and Personality Change'' (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], established the [[Parent Effectiveness Training|Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.)]] movement. Another student, [[Eugene T. Gendlin]], who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the practice of [[Focusing (psychotherapy)|Focusing]] based on Rogerian listening. In 1956, Rogers became the first President of the American Academy of Psychotherapists.<ref>[http://www.aapweb.com/history.html American Academy of Psychotherapists History of the Academy<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957\u201363), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961). Carl Rogers and [[Abraham Maslow]] (1908\u201370) pioneered a movement called [[humanistic psychology]] which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> Carl Rogers was also one of the people who questioned the rise of [[McCarthyism]] in 1950s.

Rogers left the WBSI to help found the Center for Studies of the Person in 1968. His later books include ''Carl Rogers on Personal Power'' (1977) and ''Freedom to Learn for the 80's'' (1983). He remained a resident of La Jolla for the rest of his life, doing therapy, giving speeches and writing until his sudden death in 1987. In 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured [[human pelvis|pelvis]]: he had life alert and was able to contact paramedics. He had a successful operation, but his [[pancreas]] failed the next night and he died a few days later after a heart attack.  <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/06/obituaries/carl-r-rogers-85-leader-in-psychotherapy-dies.html?pagewanted=all</ref>\n\nRogers's last years were devoted to applying his theories in situations of political oppression and national social conflict, traveling worldwide to do so. In [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], he brought together influential Protestants and Catholics; in South Africa, blacks and whites; in Brazil people emerging from dictatorship to democracy; in the United States, consumers and providers in the health field. His last trip, at age 85, was to the Soviet Union, where he lectured and facilitated intensive experiential workshops fostering communication and creativity. He was astonished at the numbers of Russians who knew of his work.\n\nTogether with his daughter, Natalie Rogers, and psychologists Maria Bowen, Maureen O'Hara, and John K. Wood, between 1974 and 1984, Rogers convened a series of residential programs in the US, Europe, Brazil and Japan, the Person-Centered Approach Workshops, which focused on cross-cultural communications, personal growth, self-empowerment, and learning for social change.\n\n==Theory==\n{{Psychology sidebar}}\nRogers' theory of the self is considered to be [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[Existential psychology|existential]], and [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]].<ref>Dagmar Pescitelli, [http://pandc.ca/?cat=carl_rogers&page=rogerian_theory ''An Analysis of Carl Rogers' Theory of Personality'']</ref> His theory is based directly on the \"[[phenomenal field theory|phenomenal field]]\" personality theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).<ref>Snygg, Donald and Combs, Arthur W. (1949), ''Individual Behavior: A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper & Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' \"Phenomenal Field\" Theory]</ref> Rogers' elaboration of his own theory is extensive. He wrote 16 books and many more journal articles describing it. Prochaska and Norcross (2003) states Rogers \"consistently stood for an empirical evaluation of psychotherapy. He and his followers have demonstrated a humanistic approach to conducting therapy and a scientific approach to evaluating therapy need not be incompatible.\"\n\n===Nineteen propositions===\nHis theory (as of 1953) was based on 19 propositions:<ref name=\"r53\">{{cite book |title=Client-centered therapy: Its current practice, implications and theory.|first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1953 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84119-840-4}}</ref>\n# All individuals (organisms) exist in a continually changing world of experience (phenomenal field) of which they are the center.\n# The organism reacts to the field as it is experienced and perceived. This perceptual field is \"reality\" for the individual.\n# The organism reacts as an organized whole to this phenomenal field.\n# A portion of the total perceptual field gradually becomes differentiated as the self.\n# As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluational interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed\u2014an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the \"I\" or the \"me\", together with values attached to these concepts.\n# The organism has one basic tendency and striving\u2014to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism.\n# The best vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frame of reference of the individual.\n# Behavior is basically the goal-directed attempt of the organism to satisfy its needs as experienced, in the field as perceived.\n# Emotion accompanies, and in general facilitates, such goal directed behavior, the kind of emotion being related to the perceived significance of the behavior for the maintenance and enhancement of the organism.\n# The values attached to experiences, and the values that are a part of the self-structure, in some instances, are values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, as if they had been experienced directly.\n# As experiences occur in the life of the individual, they are either, a) symbolized, perceived and organized into some relation to the self, b) ignored because there is no perceived relationship to the self structure, c) denied symbolization or given distorted symbolization because the experience is inconsistent with the structure of the self.\n# Most of the ways of behaving that are adopted by the organism are those that are consistent with the concept of self.\n# In some instances, behavior may be brought about by organic experiences and needs which have not been symbolized. Such behavior may be inconsistent with the structure of the self but in such instances the behavior is not \"owned\" by the individual.\n# Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent relationship with the concept of self.\n# Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of the self structure. When this situation exists, there is a basic or potential psychological tension.\n# Any experience which is inconsistent with the organization of the structure of the self may be perceived as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.\n# Under certain conditions, involving primarily complete absence of threat to the self structure, experiences which are inconsistent with it may be perceived and examined, and the structure of self revised to assimilate and include such experiences.\n# When the individual perceives and accepts into one consistent and integrated system all her sensory and visceral experiences, then she is necessarily more understanding of others and is more accepting of others as separate individuals.\n# As the individual perceives and accepts into his self structure more of his organic experiences, he finds that he is replacing his present value system\u2014based extensively on introjections which have been distortedly symbolized\u2014with a continuing organismic valuing process.\n\nIn relation to No. 17, Rogers is known for practicing \"[[unconditional positive regard]]\", which is defined as accepting a person \"without negative judgment of .... [a person's] basic worth\".<ref>Barry, P. (2002). Mental Health and Mental Illness. (7th ed.) New York: Lippincott.</ref>\n\n===Development of the personality===\nWith regard to development, Rogers described principles rather than stages. The main issue is the development of a self-concept and the progress from an undifferentiated self to being fully differentiated.\n\n{{quote|'''Self Concept''' ... the organized consistent conceptual gestalt composed of perceptions of the characteristics of 'I' or 'me' and the perceptions of the relationships of the 'I' or 'me' to others and to various aspects of life, together with the values attached to these perceptions. It is a gestalt which is available to awareness though not necessarily in awareness. It is a fluid and changing gestalt, a process, but at any given moment it is a specific entity.

Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves. Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as ''conditions of worth'') that have been laid down for them by others.\n\n===Fully functioning person===\nOptimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state. He describes this as ''the good life'', where the organism continually aims to fulfill its full potential. He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):<ref name=\"r61\">{{cite book |title=On becoming a person: A therapist's view of psychotherapy |first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1961 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84529-057-7}}</ref>\n# A growing openness to experience \u2013 they move away from defensiveness and have no need for subception (a perceptual defense that involves unconsciously applying strategies to prevent a troubling stimulus from entering consciousness).\n# An increasingly existential lifestyle \u2013 living each moment fully \u2013 not distorting the moment to fit personality or self-concept but allowing personality and self-concept to emanate from the experience. This results in excitement, daring, adaptability, tolerance, spontaneity, and a lack of rigidity and suggests a foundation of trust. \"To open one's spirit to what is going on now, and discover in that present process whatever structure it appears to have\" (Rogers 1961)<ref name=\"r61\"/>\n# Increasing organismic trust \u2013 they trust their own judgment and their ability to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment. They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences they will be able to trust their own sense of right and wrong.\n# Freedom of choice \u2013 not being shackled by the restrictions that influence an incongruent individual, they are able to make a wider range of choices more fluently. They believe that they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior.\n# Creativity \u2013 it follows that they will feel more free to be creative. They will also be more creative in the way they adapt to their own circumstances without feeling a need to conform.\n# Reliability and constructiveness \u2013 they can be trusted to act constructively. An individual who is open to all their needs will be able to maintain a balance between them. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals.\n# A rich full life \u2013 he describes the life of the fully functioning individual as rich, full and exciting and suggests that they experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely. Rogers' description of ''the good life'':{{quote|This process of the good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted. It involves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of one's potentialities. It involves the courage to be. It means launching oneself fully into the stream of life. (Rogers 1961)<ref name=\"r61\"/>}}\n\n===Incongruence===\nRogers identified the \"[[real self]]\" as the aspect of one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the \"you\" that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, to the extent that our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an \"ideal self\". By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the \"I am\" and the \"I should\" is called ''incongruity''.\n\n===Psychopathology===\nRogers described the concepts of ''congruence'' and ''incongruence'' as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for ''positive regard''. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out.\n\nRogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy ''defense mechanisms'' to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: ''distortion'' and ''denial''. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.\n\nThis defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self structure. If the incongruence is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic. Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruence of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.\n\n==Applications==\n{{main|Person-centered therapy|Student-centered learning}}\n\n===Person-centered therapy===\n{{main|Person-centered therapy}}\nRogers originally developed his theory to be the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called this \"non-directive therapy\" but later replaced the term \"non-directive\" with the term \"client-centered\" and then later used the term \"person-centered\". Even before the publication of ''Client-Centered Therapy'' in 1951, Rogers believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation. As a result, he started to use the term ''person-centered approach'' later in his life to describe his overall theory. [[Person-centered therapy]] is the application of the person-centered approach to the therapy situation. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, [[cross-cultural]] relations and other \"helping\" professions and situations. In 1946 Rogers co-authored \"Counseling with Returned Servicemen\" with John L. Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as ''[[The Interpersonal Gap]]''),<ref>Rogers, C. & Wallen, J.L. (1946) Counseling with Returned Servicemen. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> documenting the application of person-centered approach to counseling military personnel returning from the second world war.\n\nThe first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the client-centered approach was published in 1941 at the Ohio State University by [[Elias Porter]], using the recordings of therapeutic sessions between Carl Rogers and his clients.<ref>Porter, E.H.

Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]]</ref><ref>Rogers, Carl. (1951). ''Client-Centered Therapy.'' p. 64</ref>\n\n===Learner-centered teaching===\nThe application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy with studies having begun in the late 1930s and continuing today (Cornelius-White, 2007). Rogers described the approach to education in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' and wrote ''Freedom to Learn'' devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969. ''Freedom to Learn'' was revised two times. The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education.\nRogers and Harold Lyon began a book prior to Rogers death, entitled ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher\u2014Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon'', which was completed by Lyon and Reinhard Tausch and published in 2013 containing Rogers last unpublished writings on person-centered teaching.<ref>Rogers, Carl R, Lyon, Harold C., Tausch, Reinhard: (2013) On Becoming an Effective Teacher\u2014Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon. London: Routledge</ref> Rogers had the following five hypotheses regarding learner-centered education:<references group=\"Rogers, Carl R, Lyon, Harold C., Tausch, Reinhard: (2013) On Becoming an Effective Teacher\u2014Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon. London: Routledge:\" />\n# \"A person cannot teach another person directly; a person can only facilitate another's learning\" (Rogers, 1951). This is a result of his personality theory, which states that everyone exists in a constantly changing world of experience in which he or she is the center. Each person reacts and responds based on perception and experience. The belief is that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. The focus is on the student (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, the background and experiences of the learner are essential to how and what is learned. Each student will process what he or she learns differently depending on what he or she brings to the classroom.\n# \"A person learns significantly only those things that are perceived as being involved in the maintenance of or enhancement of the structure of self\" (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, relevancy to the student is essential for learning. The students' experiences become the core of the course.\n# \"Experience which, if assimilated, would involve a change in the organization of self, tends to be resisted through denial or distortion of symbolism\" (Rogers, 1951). If the content or presentation of a course is inconsistent with preconceived information, the student will learn if he or she is open to varying concepts. Being open to consider concepts that vary from one's own is vital to learning. Therefore, gently encouraging open-mindedness is helpful in engaging the student in learning. Also, it is important, for this reason, that new information be relevant and related to existing experience.\n# \"The structure and organization of self appears to become more rigid under threats and to relax its boundaries when completely free from threat\" (Rogers, 1951). If students believe that concepts are being forced upon them, they might become uncomfortable and fearful. A barrier is created by a tone of threat in the classroom. Therefore, an open, friendly environment in which trust is developed is essential in the classroom. Fear of retribution for not agreeing with a concept should be eliminated. A classroom tone of support helps to alleviate fears and encourages students to have the courage to explore concepts and beliefs that vary from those they bring to the classroom. Also, new information might threaten the student's concept of him- or herself; therefore, the less vulnerable the student feels, the more likely he or she will be able to open up to the learning process.\n# \"The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (a) threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum and (b) differentiated perception of the field is facilitated\" (Rogers, 1951). The instructor should be open to learning from the students and also working to connect the students to the subject matter. Frequent interaction with the students will help achieve this goal. The instructor's acceptance of being a mentor who guides rather than the expert who tells is instrumental to student-centered, nonthreatening, and unforced learning.\n\n===Rogerian rhetorical approach===\nIn 1970, Richard Young, [[Alton L. Becker]], and [[Kenneth Pike]] published ''Rhetoric: Discovery and Change'', a widely influential college writing textbook that used a [[Rogerian argument|Rogerian approach]] to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric. The Rogerian method of argument involves each side restating the other's position to the satisfaction of the other. In a paper, it can be expressed by carefully acknowledging and understanding the opposition, rather than dismissing them.<ref>Rogers, Carl. ''Communication: Its Blocking and Its Facilitation''. [On Becoming a Person. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961. 329-337.]</ref>\n\n===Cross-cultural relations===\nThe application to cross-cultural relations has involved workshops in highly stressful situations and global locations including conflicts and challenges in South Africa, Central America, and Ireland.<ref name=\"StrasserRandolph2004\">{{cite book|author1=Freddie Strasser|author2=Paul Randolph|title=Mediation: A Psychological Insight Into Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHiUxPcizvUC&pg=PA13|date=30 December 2004|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-7503-9|pages=13}}</ref> Along with Alberto Zucconi and Charles Devonshire, he co-founded the Istituto dell'Approccio Centrato sulla Persona (Person-Centered Approach Institute) in Rome, Italy.\n\nHis international work for peace culminated in the Rust Peace Workshop which took place in November 1985 in [[Rust, Austria]]. Leaders from 17 nations convened to discuss the topic \"The Central America Challenge\". The meeting was notable for several reasons: it brought national figures together as people (not as their positions), it was a private event, and was an overwhelming positive experience where members heard one another and established real personal ties, as opposed to stiffly formal and regulated diplomatic meetings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Carl|title=The Carl Rogers Reader|year=1989|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CRnR87UQbMwC&pg=PA457&lpg=PA457&dq=1985+the+rust+peace+workshop#v=onepage&q=1985%20the%20rust%20peace%20workshop&f=false|isbn=0395483573}}</ref>\n\n=== Person-centered, dialogic politics ===\nSome scholars believe there is a politics implicit in Rogers's approach to psychotherapy.<ref name=Thorne>Thorne, Brian, with Sanders, Pete (2012).

After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]], who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the '''Casimir effect''' in the narrow sense.\n\nPredictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, and recent calculations have considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of [[liquid helium]] films. However it was not until 1997 that a direct experiment by S. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.<ref name=Lamoureaux1997 /> Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.\n\n==Possible causes==\n===Vacuum energy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Faster-than-light]] -->\n{{Quantum field theory}}\n{{Main article|Vacuum energy}}\nThe causes of the Casimir effect are described by [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a \"field\" in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.\n\nThe vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]], or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, \"empty\" in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is\n\n:<math>{E}=\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix} \\hbar \\omega \\ .</math>\n\nSumming over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only ''differences'' in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains [[Quantum gravity#Nonrenormalizability of gravity|beyond the scope of quantum field theory]]), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a [[Renormalization#Attitudes and interpretation|cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists]] before the development in the 1970s of the [[renormalization group]], a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.\n\nWhen the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently [[Cosmological constant problem|no compelling explanation]] as to why it should not result in a [[cosmological constant]] that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed.<ref name=Rugh>\n{{cite journal\n |author=SE Rugh, H Zinkernagel\n |year=2002 \n |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem\n |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/398/\n |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics\n |volume=33 |pages=663\u2013705\n |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3\n |issue=4\n |last2=Zinkernagel \n |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}</ref> However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]], there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should.<ref name=Bianchi>\n{{cite arXiv |eprint=1002.3966\n |last1=Bianchi\n |first1=Eugenio\n |title=Why all these prejudices against a constant?\n |last2=Rovelli\n |first2=Carlo\n |class=astro-ph.CO\n |year=2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Casimir effect for [[fermion]]s can be understood as the [[spectral asymmetry]] of the [[(\u22121)F|fermion operator]] <math>(-1)^F</math>, where it is known as the [[Witten index]].\n\n===Relativistic van der Waals force===\nAlternatively, a 2005 paper by [[Robert Jaffe]] of MIT states that \"Casimir effects\ncan be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies.

In this interpretation, there exists a ground (vacuum) state of the ''coupled'' system of matter and fields, which determines the ground-state properties of the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a force. The Casimir force is fundamentally a property of the coupled system of matter and fields, in which the interaction between the plates is mediated by the zero-point fields. In more traditional interpretations, however, the emphasis has fallen on either the electromagnetic field or the fluctuating material in the plates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=W.M.R. |title=Ontological aspects of the Casimir effect |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |volume=48 |pages=84\u201388 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2014.08.001 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219814000859|arxiv=1307.6083 |bibcode = 2014SHPMP..48...84S }}</ref>\n\n==Effects==\nCasimir's observation was that the [[Canonical quantization|second-quantized]] quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or dielectric.\n\nConsider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[Cavity magnetron|radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is <math>E_n</math>. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then\n\n:<math>\\langle E \\rangle=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_n E_n</math>\n\nwith the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 is present because the zero-point energy of the n'th mode is <math>E_n/2</math>, where <math>E_n</math> is the energy increment for the n'th mode. (It is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation <math>E=\\hbar \\omega/2</math>.) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.\n\nIn particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity. Each energy level <math>E_n</math> depends on the shape, and so one should write <math>E_n(s)</math> for the energy level, and <math>\\langle E(s) \\rangle</math> for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by <math>\\delta s</math>, at point ''p''. That is, one has\n\n:<math>F(p)=- \\left. \\frac{\\delta \\langle E(s) \\rangle} {\\delta s} \\right\\vert_p.\\,</math>\n\nThis value is finite in many practical calculations.<ref>For a brief summary, see the introduction in {{cite journal |last1=Passante |first1=R. |last2=Spagnolo |first2=S. |title=Casimir-Polder interatomic potential between two atoms at finite temperature and in the presence of boundary conditions |arxiv=0708.2240 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=76 |pages=042112 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042112 |issue=4 |bibcode=2007PhRvA..76d2112P }}</ref>\n\nAttraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). With ''a'' << ''L'', the states within the slot of width ''a'' are highly constrained so that the energy ''E'' of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region ''L'', where there is a large number (numbering about ''L'' / ''a'') of states with energy evenly spaced between ''E'' and the next mode in the narrow slot &ndash; in other words, all slightly larger than ''E''. Now on shortening ''a'' by d''a'' (< 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to &minus;d''a''/''a'', whereas all the ''L'' /''a'' states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to d''a''/''L'' (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the ''L''/''a'' modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make ''a'' slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.\n\n==Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization==\n* ''See '''[[v:Quantum mechanics/Casimir effect in one dimension|Wikiversity]]''' for an elementary calculation in one dimension.''\n\nIn the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance <math>a</math> apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the ''xy''-plane, the standing waves are\n\n:<math>\\psi_n(x,y,z;t)=e^{-i\\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \\sin(k_n z)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi</math> stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, <math>k_x</math> and <math>k_y</math> are the [[wave number]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and\n\n:<math>k_n=\\frac{n\\pi}{a}</math>\n\nis the wave-number perpendicular to the plates. Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that \u03c8 vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is\n\n:<math>\\omega_n=c \\sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{a^2}}</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in ''k''-space. The assumption of [[Van Hove singularity#Theory|periodic boundary conditions]] yields,\n\n:<math>\\langle E \\rangle=\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cdot 2\n\\int \\frac{A dk_x dk_y}{(2\\pi)^2} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\omega_n </math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\langle E(s) \\rangle}{A}=\\hbar\n\\int \\frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\\pi)^2} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\omega_n\n\\vert \\omega_n\\vert^{-s}.</math>\n\nIn the end, the limit <math>s\\to 0</math> is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3. The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s''=3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s''=0, where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\langle E(s) \\rangle}{A}=\n\\frac{\\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\\pi^2} \\sum_n \\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi qdq\n\\left \\vert q^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \\right\\vert^{(1-s)/2},</math>\n\nwhere [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] <math>q^2=k_x^2+k_y^2</math> were introduced to turn the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] into a single integral. The <math>q</math> in front is the Jacobian, and the <math>2\\pi</math> comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if Re[''s''] > 3, resulting in\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\langle E(s) \\rangle}{A}=\n-\\frac {\\hbar c^{1-s} \\pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \\frac{1}{3-s}\n\\sum_n \\vert n\\vert ^{3-s}=\n-\\frac {\\hbar c^{1-s} \\pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}}\\sum_n \\frac{1}{\\left| n\\right| ^{s-3}}.</math>\n\nThe sum diverges at ''s'' in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to ''s''=0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{A}=\n\\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{\\langle E(s) \\rangle}{A}=\n-\\frac {\\hbar c \\pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \\zeta (-3).</math>\n\nBut\n\n:<math>\\zeta(-3)=\\frac {1} {120}</math>\n\nand so one obtains\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{A}=\n\\frac {-\\hbar c \\pi^{2}}{720 a^{3}}.</math>\n\nThe analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area <math>F_c / A</math> for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is\n\n:<math>{F_c \\over A}=-\\frac{d}{da} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{A} = -\\frac {\\hbar c \\pi^2} {240 a^4}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\hbar</math> (hbar, \u0127) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],\n:<math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]],\n:<math>a</math> is the [[distance]] between the two plates\n\nThe force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of <math>\\hbar</math> shows that the Casimir force per unit area <math>F_c / A</math> is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.\n\nNOTE: In Casimir's original derivation [http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf], a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). The 0-point energy on ''both'' sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above ''ad hoc'' analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation]] with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as <math>\\vert\\omega_n\\vert^{-s}</math> in the above.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruggiero |first1=Zimerman |last2=Villani |title=Application of Analytic Regularization to the Casimir Forces |journal=Revista Brasileira de F\u00edsica |volume=7 |number=3 |year=1977 |url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v07/v07a43.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===More recent theory===\nCasimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and his students.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E M |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=Lev P |title=GENERAL THEORY OF VAN DER WAALS' FORCES |journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi |volume=4 |pages=153 |year=1961 |doi=10.1070/PU1961v004n02ABEH003330 |issue=2 |bibcode=1961SvPhU...4..153D }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Kats |first2=E I |title=Casimir forces in modulated systems |arxiv=cond-mat/0408348 |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=16 |pages=5659 |year=2004 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/32/003 |issue=32 |bibcode=2004JPCM...16.5659D }}</ref> Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials.

This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.\n\nThe [[heat kernel regularization|heat kernel]] or [[Exponential function|exponentially]] regulated sum is\n:<math>\\langle E(t) \\rangle=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_n \\hbar |\\omega_n |\n\\exp (-t |\\omega_n |)</math>\n\nwhere the limit <math>t\\to 0^+</math> is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as\n\n:<math>\\langle E(t) \\rangle=\\frac{C}{t^3} + \\textrm{finite}\\,</math>\n\nfor three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator\n\n:<math>\\langle E(t) \\rangle=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_n \\hbar |\\omega_n |\n\\exp (-t^2 |\\omega_n |^2)</math>\n\nis better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The [[zeta function regulator]]\n\n:<math>\\langle E(s) \\rangle=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_n \\hbar |\\omega_n | |\\omega_n |^{-s}</math>\n\nis completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s''=4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s''=0.\n\nNot every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s''=0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[X-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', \"Theory of Continuous Media\".)\n\n==Generalities==\nThe Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called \"[[virtual particle]]s\".\n\nMore interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.\n\nIn the [[chiral bag model]] of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon.\n\n==Dynamical Casimir effect==\nThe dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated ''moving mirror''. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to [[quantum mechanics]] equations made in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fulling |first1=S. A. |last2=Davies |first2=P. C.

They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a [[mint (facility)|mint]] in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government.\n\nCoins are usually metal or [[alloy]], or sometimes made of synthetic materials. They are usually [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as [[bullion coin]]s. Other coins are used as [[money]] in everyday transactions, circulating alongside [[banknote]]s. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (i.e. excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to [[inflation]]. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see [[Gresham's law]]).\n\nExceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value also occur for some bullion coins made of copper, [[silver]], or [[gold]] (and, rarely, other metals, such as [[platinum]] or [[palladium]]), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the [[Sovereign (British coin)|British sovereign]] minted by the United Kingdom, the [[American Gold Eagle]] minted by the United States, the [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf]] minted by Canada, and the [[Krugerrand]], minted by South Africa. While the Eagle, Maple Leaf, and Sovereign coins have nominal (purely symbolic) face values, the Krugerrand does not.\n\nHistorically, a great quantity of [[coinage metals]] (including alloys) and other materials (e.g. [[porcelain]]) have been used to produce coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment: bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tony Clayton |url=http://www.coinsoftheuk.co.uk/pics/metal.html |title=Comprehensive list of metals and their alloys which have been used at various times, in coins for all types of purposes |publisher=coinsoftheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-08-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Square Shoulder Spade.jpg|thumb|[[Spade money]] from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], circa 650-400 BC.]]\n[[File:Kurus (Kurukshetras) circa 350-315 BCE.jpg|thumb|A [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] [[punch-marked coin]], circa 350-315 BC, one of the earliest example of [[coinage of India|coinage in India]].]]\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|right|An original Celtic [[Biatec]] coin and its replica on a former Slovak 5-[[Slovak koruna|koruna]] coin (1993-2008)]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nThe first coins were developed in [[Iron Age Anatolia]] around the 7th and 6th centuries BC.

Important Roman [[gold coin|gold]] and [[silver coin|silver]] coins were continued into the Middle Ages (see [[Gold dinar]], [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]], [[Aureus]], [[Denarius]]). Ancient and early medieval coins in theory had the value of their metal content, although there have been many instances throughout history of governments inflating their currencies by debasing the metal content of their coinage, so that the inferior coins were worth less in metal than their face value. [[Fiat money]] first arose in medieval China, with the [[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]] paper money. Early paper money was introduced in Europe in the later Middle Ages, but some coins continued to have the value of the gold or silver they contained throughout the [[Early Modern period]].

Therefore, the dating of these coins relies primarily on archaeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations at the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]). Because the oldest lion head \"coins\" were discovered in that temple, and they do not appear to have been used in commerce, these objects may not have been coins but badges or medals issued by the priests of that temple.

This means that the value of the coin is decreed by government fiat (law), and thus is determined by the [[free market]] only in as much as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded internationally on [[foreign exchange market]]s. Thus, these coins are monetary [[Token coin|tokens]], just as paper currency is: they are usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of government guarantee. Some have suggested that such coins not be considered to be \"true coins\" (see below). Thus, there is very little economic difference between notes and coins of equivalent face value.\n\nCoins may be in circulation with fiat values lower than the value of their component metals, but they are never initially issued with such value, and the shortfall only arises over time due to [[inflation]], as market values for the metal overtake the fiat declared face value of the coin. Examples are the [[Coinage Act of 1965|pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar]] (nominally containing slightly less than a tenth, quarter, half, and full ounce of silver, respectively), [[Nickel (United States coin)|US nickel]], and [[Cent (United States coin)|pre-1982 US penny]]. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between fiat values and metal values of coins cause coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realise the value of their metal content. This is an example of [[Gresham's law]]. The [[United States Mint]], in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?action=press_release&ID=724 |title=United States Mint Moves to Limit Exportation & Melting of Coins |publisher=The United States Mint |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527072103/http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom//index.cfm?action=press_release&ID=724 |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}</ref> Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years.\n\n=== Collector's item ===\n{{Main article|Numismatics}}\nA coin's value as a collector's item or as an investment generally depends on its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality, beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. The value of bullion coins is also influenced to some extent by those factors, but is largely based on the value of their gold, silver, or platinum content. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the [[Canadian Maple Leaf]] and the [[American Gold Eagle]] are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these face values have no relevance.\n\n=== Medium of expression ===\nCoins can be used as creative medium of expression \u2013 from fine art sculpture to the penny machines that can be found in most amusement parks. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the United States there are some regulations specific to nickels and pennies that are informative on this topic. 31 CFR \u00a7&nbsp;82.1 forbids unauthorized persons from exporting, melting, or treating any 5 or 1 cent coins.\n\nThis has been a particular problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while,{{when|date=July 2015}} the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the [[US Treasury]]. This was more of a problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration make more sense historically.\n\n31 CFR \u00a7&nbsp;82.2 goes on to state that: \"(b) The prohibition contained in \u00a7&nbsp;82.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins.\"\n\n== Debasement and Clipping ==\n{{Main article|Debasement}}\nThroughout history, monarchs and governments have often created more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow if the coins were pure metal. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a [[base metal]] (often [[copper]] or [[nickel]]), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby \"debasing\" the money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement occasionally occurs in order to make the coin physically harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly, but the more usual reason is to profit from the difference between face value and metal value. Debasement of money almost always leads to price [[inflation]]. Sometimes [[price control]]s are at the same time also instituted by the governing authority, but historically these have generally proved unworkable.\n\nThe United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is valued at [[Quarter (United States coin)|25 cents]], a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents' worth of copper.\n\nSome denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of a half cent, two cents, three cents, and twenty cents. (The half dollar and dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) In the past, the US also coined the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five-cent coins (known then as \"half dimes\") were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollar coins were also much larger, and weighed approximately an ounce.  One-dollar gold coins are no longer produced and rarely used. The US also issues bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50\u00a2, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.\n\nCirculating coins commonly suffered from \"shaving\" or \"clipping\": the public would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to sell it and then pass on the mutilated coins at full value.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Financial Crises |last=Cooper |first=George |year= 2008|publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-47345-5 |page=46 }}</ref> Unmilled British [[sterling silver]] coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England was commented on by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], whose name was later attached to [[Gresham's law]]. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally.<ref>Denis R. Cooper ''The Art and Craft of Coinmaking. A History of Minting Technology''. London: Spink, 1988. {{ISBN|0-907605-27-3}} p.47</ref> Many coins have milled or [[Reeding#Numismatics|reeded edges]], originally designed to make it easier to detect clipping.\n\n== Other uses ==\n{{see also|Exonumia}}\nSome convicted criminals from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called \"convict love tokens\" or \"leaden hearts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/convict_tokens |title=Convict tokens, National Museum of Australia |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date=2012-01-25}}</ref> A number of these tokens are in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].\n\n== Features of modern coins ==\n[[File:Contando Dinheiro (8228640).jpg|thumb|left|Coins can be stacked.]]\n[[File:1884 trade dollar rev.jpg|thumb|upright|1884 [[Trade dollar (United States coin)|United States trade dollar]]]]\n[[File:20franctrimetalrev.jpg|thumb|185px|French 1992 twenty Franc Tri-Metallic coin]]\n[[File:Kingtutcoinobv without background.png|thumb|upright|Bimetallic Egyptian one pound coin featuring King Tutankhamen]]\n\nThe side of a coin carrying an image of a monarch, other authority (''see [[List of people on coins]]''), or a [[national emblem]] is called the ''[[obverse]]'' (colloquially, ''heads''); the other side, carrying various types of information, is called the ''[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]'' (colloquially, ''tails''). The year of [[mint (coin)|minting]] is usually shown on the obverse, although some [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] coins, most [[Canadian coinage|Canadian]] coins, the pre-2008 British [[Twenty pence (British decimal coin)|20p]] coin, the post-1999 American [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], and all Japanese coins are exceptions.\n\nThe relation of the images on the obverse and reverse of a coin is the coin's orientation.  Suppose the image on the obverse of the coin is right side up; if you turn the coin left or right on its horizontal axis, and the reverse of the coin is also right side up, then the coin is said to have [[medallic orientation]]\u2014typical of the [[Euro]] and [[pound sterling]]; if, however, turning the coin left or right shows that the reverse image is upside down, then the coin is said to have [[coin orientation]], characteristic of the [[United States dollar]] coin. \n\n[[Bimetallic coins]] are sometimes used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating bimetallic examples include the [[1 euro coins|\u20ac1]], [[2 euro coins|\u20ac2]], [[One pound (British coin)|British \u00a31]], [[Two pounds (British coin)|\u00a32]] and [[Canadian 2 dollar coin|Canadian $2]] and several peso coins in Mexico.\n\nThe ''exergue'' is the space on a coin beneath the main design, often used to show the coin's date, although it is sometimes left blank or containing a [[mint mark]], [[privy mark]], or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins do not have an exergue at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.\n\n[[File:RR5111-0173.gif|upright|thumb|3 [[Russian ruble]]s coin minted in 2008]]\nNot all coins are round; they come in a [[Coinage shapes|variety of shapes]].

Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong]] and the 10-cent coins of Bahamas.

Their semi-major axes show a preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.\n\nThe 'hot' and 'cold' populations are strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, near-circular orbits. The parameters of the plutinos\u2019 orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in 0.15\u20130.2 range and low inclinations 5\u201310\u00b0.\nSee also the comparison with [[scattered disk#Scattered objects versus classical objects|scattered disk objects]].\n\nWhen the orbital eccentricities of cubewanos and plutinos are compared, it can be seen that the cubewanos form a clear 'belt' outside Neptune's orbit, whereas the plutinos approach, or even cross Neptune's orbit. When orbital inclinations are compared, 'hot' cubewanos can be easily distinguished by their higher inclinations, as the plutinos typically keep orbits below 20\u00b0. (No clear explanation currently exists for the inclinations of 'hot' cubewanos.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last        = Jewitt\n |first       = D.\n |year        = 2004\n |title       = Plutino\n |url         = http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/plutino.html\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070419234021/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/kb/plutino.html\n |archivedate = 2007-04-19\n |df          = \n}}</ref>)\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align= center\n |width1= 458\n |width2= 200\n |image1= KBOs and resonances.png\n |image2=TheKuiperBelt Projections 55AU Classical Plutinos.svg\n |footer=''Left:'' TNO distribution of cubewanos (blue), [[resonant trans-Neptunian object|resonant TNOs]] (red), [[Scattered disk object|SDO]]s (grey) and [[sednoid]]s (yellow).

Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776'' (2008)</ref> Since the 19th century, U.S. foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the [[Political realism|realist school]] to the idealistic or [[Wilsonian]] school of international relations.<ref>Richard Russell, \"American Diplomatic Realism: A Tradition Practised and Preached by George F.

These policies became the basis of the [[Federalist Party]] in the 1790s, but the rival Jeffersonians feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring the [[War of 1812]] on Britain. After the 1778 alliance with France, the U.S. did not sign another permanent treaty until the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] in 1949. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or stances have been variously expressed by [[United States Presidential doctrines|Presidential 'doctrines']], named for them. Initially these were uncommon events, but since WWII, these have been made by most presidents.\n\nJeffersonians vigorously opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against American shipping by [[Barbary corsairs]] spurred the country into developing a naval force projection capability, resulting in the [[First Barbary War]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oren|first=Michael B.|title=The Middle East and the Making of the United States, 1776 to 1815|date=2005-11-03|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/11/michaelOren.html}}</ref>\n\nDespite two wars with European Powers\u2014the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898\u2014American foreign policy was mostly peaceful and marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade during the 19th century.  The [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 doubled the nation's geographical area; [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Spain ceded]] the territory of [[Florida]] in 1819; annexation brought in the independent Texas Republic in 1845; a [[Mexican-American War|war with Mexico]] added California, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico in 1848. The U.S. [[Alaska Purchase|bought Alaska]] from the Russian Empire in 1867, and it annexed the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898. Victory over Spain in 1898 brought the [[Philippines]] and [[Puerto Rico]], as well as oversight of Cuba. The short experiment in imperialism ended by 1908, as the U.S. turned its attention to the Panama Canal and the stabilization of regions to its south, including [[Mexico]].\n\n===20th century===\n\n====World War I====\nThe 20th century was marked by two world wars in which Allied powers, along with the United States, defeated their enemies, and through this participation the United States increased its international reputation. President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] was developed from his idealistic [[Wilsonianism]] program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism to prevent future wars. It became the basis of the German Armistice (which amounted to a military surrender) and the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to European allies' punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient conformity with these points, and the U.S. signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never joined the [[League of Nations]], which was established as a result of Wilson's initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an independent course, and succeeded in a program of [[Washington Naval Conference|naval disarmament]], and [[Dawes Plan|refunding the German economy]]. Operating outside the League it became a dominant player in diplomatic affairs. New York became the financial capital of the world,<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald L. Miller|title=Supreme City: How Jazz Age Manhattan Gave Birth to Modern America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg1DCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|year=2015|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=44\u201345}}</ref> but the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] hurled the Western industrialized world into the [[Great Depression]]. American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s.\n\n====World War II====\n{{main article|Diplomatic history of World War II#United States}}\n[[File:Yalta Conference cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Allies of World War II]] at the [[Yalta Conference]]: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]\n\nThe United States adopted a non-interventionist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938, but then President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved toward strong support of the Allies in their wars against Germany and Japan. As a result of intense internal debate, the national policy was one of becoming the [[Arsenal of Democracy]], that is financing and equipping the Allied armies without sending American combat soldiers. Roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by people \"everywhere in the world\"; these included the freedom of speech and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the [[Atlantic Charter|Atlantic Conference]]; [[Atlantic Charter#Content and analysis|specific points]] were included to correct earlier failures, which became a step toward the [[United Nations]]. American policy was to threaten Japan, to force it out of China, and to prevent its attacking the Soviet Union. However, Japan reacted by an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of $50,000,000,000. Working closely with [[Winston Churchill]] of Britain, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes, ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. Much of the American war effort went to strategic bombers, which flattened the cities of Japan and Germany.\n\n====Cold War====\n{{main article|Cold War}}\n[[File: President Nixon meets with China's Communist Party Leader, Mao Tse- Tung, 02-29-1972 - NARA - 194759.tif|thumb|Chinese Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] meets with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], 1972]]\n\nAfter the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant non-colonial economic power with broad influence in much of the world, with the key policies of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Almost immediately, however, the world witnessed division into broad two camps during the [[Cold War]]; one side was led by the U.S. and the other by the Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers. A policy of [[containment]] was adopted to limit Soviet expansion, and a series of proxy wars were fought with mixed results. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states.\n\nIn domestic politics, foreign policy is not usually a central issue. In 1945\u20131970 the Democratic Party took a strong anti-Communist line and supported wars in Korea and Vietnam. Then the party split with a strong, \"dovish\", pacifist element (typified by 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern).  Many \"hawks\", advocates for war, joined the [[Neoconservative]] movement and started supporting the Republicans\u2014especially Reagan\u2014based on foreign policy.<ref>Seymour Martin Lipset, \"Neoconservatism: Myth and reality.\" ''Society'' 25.5 (1988): pp. 9-13 [http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001215/fraenkelvortraege01.pdf online].</ref> Meanwhile, down to 1952 the Republican Party was split between an isolationist wing, based in the Midwest and led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and an internationalist wing based in the East and led by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the 1952 nomination largely on foreign policy grounds. Since then the Republicans have been characterized by a hawkish and intense American nationalism, and strong opposition to Communism, and strong support for Israel.<ref>Colin  Dueck, ''Hard Line: The Republican Party and U.S. Foreign Policy since World War II'' (2010).</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nIn the 21st century, U.S. influence remains strong but, in relative terms, is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising nations such as China, India, Russia, and the newly consolidated [[European Union]]. Substantial problems remain, such as [[climate change]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and the specter of [[nuclear terrorism]]. Foreign policy analysts Hachigian and Sutphen in their book ''The Next American Century'' suggest all five powers have similar vested interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade; if they can find common ground, then the next decades may be marked by peaceful growth and prosperity.<ref name=tws13jans3w2>{{cite news|author=Nikolas K.

The chief diplomat was Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]].  His major foreign policy positions, which sometimes are at odds with Trump, include:\n:urging the United States to stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord, taking a hard line on Russia, advocating negotiations and dialogue to defuse the mounting crisis with North Korea, advocating for continued U.S. adherence to the Iran nuclear deal, taking a neutral position in the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and reassuring jittery allies, from South Korea and Japan to our NATO partners, that America still has their back.<ref>Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky, \"Should Rex Tillerson Resign?,\" [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/01/should-rex-tillerson-resign-215664 ''Politico''  October 1, 2017] </ref>\n\n==Law==\nIn the United States, there are three types of [[treaty]]-related law:\n* '''Treaties''' are formal written agreements specified by the [[Treaty Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The [[President of the United States|President]] makes a treaty with foreign powers, but then the proposed treaty must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. For example, President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] proposed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I after consulting with allied powers, but this treaty was rejected by the Senate; as a result, the U.S. subsequently made separate agreements with different nations. While most international law has a broader interpretation of the term ''treaty'', the U.S. sense of the term is more restricted. In ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the power to make treaties under the U.S. Constitution is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal government, and hence the federal government can use treaties to legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive authority of the states.\n* '''[[Executive agreement]]s''' are made by the President\u2014in the exercise of his [[President of the United States#Article II executive powers|Constitutional executive powers]]\u2014alone. \n* '''Congressional-executive agreements''' are made by the President and [[United States Congress|Congress]]. A majority of both houses makes it binding much like regular legislation after it is signed by the president. The Constitution does not expressly state that these agreements are allowed, and constitutional scholars such as [[Laurence Tribe]] think they are unconstitutional.<ref>Laurence H. Tribe, \"Taking Text and Structure Seriously: Reflections on Free-Form Method in Constitutional Interpretation,\" 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1221, 1227 (1995).</ref>\n\nIn contrast to most other nations, the United States considers the three types of agreements as distinct. Further, the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result, Congress can modify or repeal treaties afterward. It can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if this is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings confirmed this understanding, including Supreme Court decisions in ''[[The Paquete Habana|Paquete Habana v. the United States]]'' (1900), and ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' (1957), as well as a lower court ruling n ''[[Garcia-Mir v. Meese]]'' (1986). Further, the Supreme Court has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by declaring it \"unconstitutional\", although as of 2011, it has never exercised this power.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has taken the position that the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] represents established law. Generally, when the U.S. signs a treaty, it is binding. However, as a result of the ''Reid v. Covert'' decision, the U.S. adds a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] to the text of every treaty that says, in effect, that the U.S. intends to abide by the treaty, but if the treaty is found to be in violation of the Constitution, then the U.S. legally can't abide by the treaty since the U.S. signature would be ''[[ultra vires]]''.\n\n==International agreements==\n\nThe United States has ratified and participates in many other multilateral treaties, including [[arms control|arms control treaties]] (especially with the Soviet Union), human rights treaties, [[environmental protocol]]s, and [[free trade agreement]]s.\n{{further information|List of United States treaties}}\n\n===Economic and general government===\n\nThe United States is a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and most of its [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agencies]], notably including the [[World Bank Group]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] became a U.S. territory (part of the United States), while [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Palau]] became independent countries.  Each has signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] that gives the United States exclusive military access in return for U.S. defense protection and conduct of military foreign affairs (except the declaration of war) and a few billion dollars of aid.  These agreements also generally allow citizens of these countries to live and work in the United States with their spouses (and vice versa), and provide for largely free trade.  The federal government also grants access to services from domestic agencies, including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], [[National Weather Service]], the [[United States Postal Service]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]], and U.S. representation to the International Frequency Registration Board of the [[International Telecommunication Union]].\n\n{{further information|Associated state}}\n\n===Non-participation in multi-lateral agreements===\n\nThe United States notably does not participate in various international agreements adhered to by almost all other industrialized countries, by almost all the countries of the Americas, or by almost all other countries in the world.

With vast military expenditures, the United States is known as the sole remaining [[superpower]] after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The U.S. contributes a relatively small number of personnel for [[United Nations peacekeeping]] operations.  It sometimes acts through NATO, as with the [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], and [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF in Afghanistan]], but often acts unilaterally or in ad-hoc coalitions as with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\nThe [[United Nations Charter]] requires that military operations be either for self-defense or affirmatively approved by the Security Council.

Lieber and Daryl G. Press, argue in Foreign Affairs that U.S. missile defenses are designed to secure Washington's nuclear primacy and are chiefly directed at potential rivals, such as Russia and China. The authors note that Washington continues to eschew nuclear first strike and contend that deploying missile defenses \"would be valuable primarily in an offensive context, not a defensive one; as an adjunct to a US First Strike capability, not as a stand-alone shield\":\n\n<blockquote>If the United States launched a nuclear attack against Russia (or China), the targeted country would be left with only a tiny surviving arsenal, if any at all. At that point, even a relatively modest or inefficient missile defense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes.<ref>[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2006-03-01/rise-us-nuclear-primacy \"The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy\"] Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press, Foreign Affairs, March/April 2006</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis analysis is corroborated by the Pentagon's 1992 Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), prepared by then Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and his deputies. The DPG declares that the United States should use its power to \"prevent the reemergence of a new rival\" either on former Soviet territory or elsewhere. The authors of the Guidance determined that the United States had to \"Field a missile defense system as a shield against accidental missile launches or limited missile strikes by 'international outlaws'\" and also must \"Find ways to integrate the 'new democracies' of the former Soviet bloc into the U.S.-led system\". The National Archive notes that Document 10 of the DPG includes wording about \"disarming capabilities to destroy\" which is followed by several blacked out words. \"This suggests that some of the heavily excised pages in the still-classified DPG drafts may include some discussion of preventive action against threatening nuclear and other WMD programs.\"<ref>[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb245/ \"Prevent the Reemergence of a New Rival\"] The National Security Archive</ref>\n\nFinally, Robert David English, writing in Foreign Affairs, observes that in addition to the deployment U.S. missile defenses, the DPG's second recommendation has also been proceeding on course. \"Washington has pursued policies that have ignored Russian interests (and sometimes international law as well) in order to encircle Moscow with military alliances and trade blocs conducive to U.S. interests.\"<ref>[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2017-03-10/russia-trump-and-new-d-tente \"Russia, Trump, and a New D\u00e9tente\"] Foreign Affairs, March 10, 2017</ref>\n\n===Exporting democracy===\n  {{See also|American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North Africa}}\n\nIn [[United States]] history, critics have charged that [[President of the United States|presidents]] have used [[democracy]] to justify [[List of United States military history events|military intervention]] abroad.<ref name=\"Why\">{{cite journal\n |first       = Bruce Bueno de\n |last        = Mesquita\n |date        = Spring 2004\n |title       = Why Gun-Barrel Democracy Doesn't Work\n |journal     = Hoover Digest\n |volume      = 2\n |url         = http://www.hooverdigest.org/042/bdm.html\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115001/http://www.hooverdigest.org/042/bdm.html\n |archivedate = July 5, 2008\n |df          = mdy\n}} Also see [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/travbailey/why.html&date=2009-10-25+23:16:02 this page].</ref><ref name=\"Meernik 1996 391\">{{cite journal\n|first=James\n|last=Meernik\n|year=1996\n|title=United States Military Intervention and the Promotion of Democracy\n|journal=Journal of Peace Research\n|volume=33\n|issue=4\n|pages=391\u2013402\n|doi=10.1177/0022343396033004002\n}}</ref> Critics have also charged that the U.S. helped local militaries overthrow democratically elected governments in [[Operation Ajax|Iran]], [[Operation PBSUCCESS|Guatemala]], and in other instances.

Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines [[invasion|intervention]] as \"dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things.\" The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be forcibly imposed. There was disagreement about what constituted ''[[democracy]]''; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement about what constituted a \"rebellion\"; Drake saw a pattern in which the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called \"revolutions\", and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships.<ref name=\"LA1\">{{cite book |last=Lowenthal |first=Abraham F. |date=March 1, 1991 |title=Exporting Democracy : The United States and Latin America |pages=1, 4, 5|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4132-1}}</ref> Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] stated, \"The world's leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century.\"<ref name = \"Walter\">{{cite book |last=Lafeber |first=Walter |year=1993 |title=Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America |publisher=W.

See [[NATO]], [[ANZUS]], [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]], [[Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[South Korea]], and [[Major non-NATO ally]]. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection.

There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example [[Spencer R. Weart]] argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weart|first=Spencer R.|authorlink=Spencer R.

According to the U.S. State Department, \"Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others.

The observance of [[Christmas]] developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old Polish [[Paganism|pagan]] customs with the religious ones introduced after the [[Christianization of Poland]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. Later influences include mutual permeating of local traditions and various folk cultures. It is one of the most important religious holidays for Poles, who follow a somewhat strict traditional custom. [[Christmas tree]]s are decorated and lit in family rooms on the day of [[Christmas Eve]]. Other trees are placed in most public areas and outside churches.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" /> Christmas in Poland is called \"Bo\u017ce Narodzenie\", which translates to 'God's Birth'.<ref name=\"onet-translation\">{{cite web | url = http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/tlumacz.html?tr=ang-auto&translate=OK&qs=Christmas | title = Christmas - T\u0142umacz - Onet.pl Portal wiedzy | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Saint Nicholas Day|Day of Saint Nicholas]] on 6 December is the unofficial beginning of the festive season in [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/polish-christmas-customs-and-traditions-1136853|title=How Poles Celebrate Christmas (Recipes Included)|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Well-behaved children receive small gifts on the day, whereas naughty children receive a lump of coal or a twig, called \"r\u00f3zga\". The highlight of the holiday is the most significant day, [[Christmas Eve]] on the 24 December. Polish [[Wigilia]] begins with the appearance of the first star, which corresponds to the [[Star of Bethlehem]]. During preparation, hay is spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that [[Jesus Christ]] was born in a [[manger]].<ref name=\"wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://razemutah.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/traditional-christmas-eve-in-poland-wigilia-w-polsce-tradycje/|title=Traditional Christmas Eve in Poland- Wigilia w Polsce- tradycje|date=7 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> According to tradition, an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the Lord or, for a lost wanderer who may be in need of food or shelter.<ref name=\"wordpress.com\"/> The supper begins with the breaking of the [[Christmas wafer]] known as \"op\u0142atek\", a custom only observed in Poland and some parts of [[Lithuania]]. The meals must be meatless as a sign of [[fasting]] and twelve different dishes are made, thus symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]]. The celebration ends with the exchange of gifts and a [[midnight mass]] in churches.\n\nOther aspects of Polish Christmas include nativity plays called \"Jase\u0142ka\", outdoor [[nativity scene]]s, the singing of [[Christmas carol|carols]], most notably \"[[God Is Born]]\", and [[Kulig]], a sleigh ride with [[Saint Nicholas]].\n\n==Advent==\n[[File:Piotrus XMAS Tree 2008 05.JPG|thumb|left|Christmas tree in a Polish home. Traditionally, they are decorated and lit on Christmas Eve \u2013 [[Wigilia]]]]\nAmong the special tasks carried out in private homes during [[Advent]] (a time of waiting for the celebration of the [[Nativity of Jesus]]) is the baking of the Christmas [[Pierniki|piernik]] (gingerbread), and the making of Christmas decorations. Pierniks are made in a variety of shapes, including hearts, animals, and [[St. Nicholas]] figures. St. Nicholas does not play a major role on Christmas Day, but is celebrated on his Saint feast day of December 6. He visits good children in secret and leaves presents for them.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\nTraditionally, the Christmas trees are decorated with glass [[Christmas ornament|baubles]], garlands and many homemade [[Decorative arts|ornaments]] including painted eggshells, shiny red apples, walnuts, wrapped chocolate shapes, candles, etc. They are lit on [[Christmas Eve]] before [[Wigilia]]. At the top of each tree there is a star or a glittering [[tree topper]]. In many homes, [[sparkler]]s are hung on the branches of the trees for wintery ambiance. Sometimes the trees are left standing until February 2, the [[feast day]] of St. Mary of the Candle of Lighting.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\nDuring Advent and all the way until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], or the [[baptism of Jesus]] (day of January 6), the \"gwiazdory\", or the star carriers walk through the villages. Some of them sing [[carols]]; others recite verses or put on \"szopki\", or \"herody\" ([[nativity scene]]s). The last two customs are inspired by the traditional [[manger]] scenes or \"Jase\u0142ka\" ([[Nativity scene|crib]]). One tradition unique to Poland is the sharing of the \"[[op\u0142atek]]\", a thin wafer into which a holy picture is pressed. In the old days people carried these wafers from house to house wishing their neighbors a Merry Christmas. Nowadays, op\u0142atek is mostly shared with members of the family and immediate neighbors before the Christmas Eve supper ([[Wigilia]] in the Polish language). As each person shares pieces of the wafer with another, they are supposed to forgive each other any hurts that have occurred over the past year and wish them happiness in the coming year.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\n==''Wigilia'', the Christmas Eve supper==\nIn Poland, [[Christmas Eve]] is a day first of [[fasting]], then of feasting. The [[Wigilia]] feast begins at the appearance of the first star. There is no red meat served but fish, usually [[carp]]. The supper, which includes many traditional dishes and desserts, can sometimes last for over two hours. It is followed by the exchange of gifts. The next day, the [[Christmas Day]], is often spent visiting friends. In Polish tradition, people combine religion and family closeness at Christmas. Although gift-giving plays a major role in the rituals, emphasis is placed more on the making of special foods and decorations.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\nOn the night of Christmas Eve, so important is the appearance of the first star in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of \"the little star\" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, \"The star has come!\" Only after it appears, the family members sit down to a dinner table.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\nAccording to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table. In many homes an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the [[Baby Jesus]] or, for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, or if a deceased relative should come and would like to share in the meal.\n\nThe supper begins with the breaking of the [[op\u0142atek]]. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine).\n\nA traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[borscht]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (ravioli). Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] and [[gefilte fish]]. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, and for dessert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink.\n\nThe remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that \"The Little Star\" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.\n\nChristmas Eve ends with \"[[Pasterka]]\", the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the shepherds to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of  Christianity.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm  \"Bo\u017ce Narodzenie i polskie tradycje,\"] Polska Misja Katolicka, Amsterdam {{pl icon}}</ref> The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses.

The early hymns sung in Catholic church were brought to Poland by the [[Franciscan Brothers of Peace|Franciscan Brothers]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The early Christmas music was Latin in origin. When the Polish words and melodies started to become popular, including many new secular [[pastoral]]s (pastoralka, or shepherd's songs), they were not written down originally, but rather taught among people by heart. Notably, the song \"[[God Is Born]]\" (''B\u00f3g si\u0119 rodzi'') with lyrics written by [[Franciszek Karpi\u0144ski]] in 1792 became the Christmas hymn of Poland already in the court of King [[Stefan Batory]].

The 1945 work was adapted from [[Ferenc Moln\u00e1r]]'s 1909 play ''[[Liliom]]'', transplanting its [[Budapest]] setting to the [[Maine]] coastline. The story revolves around<!-- pun intended --> [[carousel]] [[barker (occupation)|barker]] Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the well-known songs \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\" and \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\". Richard Rodgers later wrote that ''Carousel'' was his favorite of all his musicals.\n\nFollowing the spectacular success of the first [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical, ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with ''Oklahoma!'', most likely unfavorably. They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to ''Liliom''; Moln\u00e1r had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.\n\nThe musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts, but once it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 19, 1945, it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences. ''Carousel'' initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1950. Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as ''Oklahoma!'', the piece has been repeatedly revived, recorded several times and was [[Carousel (film)|filmed in 1956]].  A production by [[Nicholas Hytner]] enjoyed success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour. Another Broadway revival opened in 2018.  In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named ''Carousel'' the best musical of the 20th century.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== ''Liliom'' ===\n\n[[Ferenc Moln\u00e1r]]'s Hungarian-language drama, ''[[Liliom]]'', premiered in [[Budapest]] in 1909.  The audience was puzzled  by the work, and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the first shadow on Moln\u00e1r's successful career as a playwright.  ''Liliom'' was not presented again until after [[World War I]].  When it reappeared on the Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit.<ref>Moln\u00e1r, pp. ix\u2013x</ref>\n\n[[File:Liliom offers Louise a star.jpg|thumb|\"A star\u2014please, my dear\u2014I must do something good.\"  Liliom ([[Joseph Schildkraut]]) offers Louise (Evelyn Chard) the star he stole; 1921 [[Theatre Guild]] production]]\nExcept for the ending, the plots of ''Liliom'' and ''Carousel'' are very similar.<ref>Fordin, p. 226</ref>  Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom, the Hungarian word for \"lily\", a slang term for \"tough guy\"),<ref name=\"Hyland, p. 158\">Hyland, p. 158</ref> a carnival [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together.  With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant.  A subplot involves Julie's friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel porter\u2014after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the hotel.  Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs himself.  He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven's police court.  As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God Himself.  Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.<ref name=\"liliom\" />\n\nOn his return to Earth, Liliom encounters his daughter, Louise, who like her mother is now a factory worker.  Saying that he knew her father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens.  When Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her.  Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him.  Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss.  Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen.<ref name=\"liliom\">Moln\u00e1r, pp. 1\u2013185</ref>\n\nAn English translation of ''Liliom'' was credited to [[Benjamin Glazer|Benjamin \"Barney\" Glazer]], though there is a story that the actual translator, uncredited, was  Rodgers' first major partner [[Lorenz Hart]].<ref name=\"n153\" />  The [[Theatre Guild]] presented it in New York City in 1921, with [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as Liliom,<ref name=\"n153\" /> and the play was a success, running 300&nbsp;performances.<ref name=\"h38\">Hischak, p. 38</ref>  A 1940 revival, with [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers.<ref name=\"n153\">Nolan, p. 153</ref> Glazer, in introducing the English translation of ''Liliom'', wrote of the play's appeal:\n\n<blockquote>And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched\u2014Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.&nbsp;... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.<ref>Moln\u00e1r, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Inception ===\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] hits with other partners.  Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre:  ''[[On Your Toes]]'' was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\" scene), while ''Pal Joey'' flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero.<ref>Block (ed.), pp. 194\u201395</ref>  Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref name=\"HOF\">[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \"Oscar Hammerstein II\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=2010-12-17 }}.

In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before ''Oklahoma!'' and what came after it.\"<ref name=\"h202\">Hischak, pp. 201\u201302</ref>  An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, ''Oklahoma!'' would serve, according to Hischak, as \"the model for Broadway shows for decades\",<ref name=\"h202\" /> and proved a huge popular and financial success.  Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair.  Film producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] saw ''Oklahoma!'' and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers \"was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref name=\"shoot\">Rodgers, p. 234</ref>  As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, \"We're such fools.  No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another ''Oklahoma!''' \"<ref name=\"Fordin, p. 224\">Fordin, p. 224</ref>\n\n''Oklahoma!'' had been a struggle to finance and produce.  Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with [[Theresa Helburn]] and [[Lawrence Langner]] of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed \"the Gloat Club\".  At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Moln\u00e1r's ''Liliom'' into a musical.  Both men refused\u2014they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre.<ref name=\"n153\" />  In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal.<ref name=\"tunnel\">Fordin, p. 220</ref>  At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed ''Liliom'', suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]].  Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with \"zis\" and \"zose\", would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.<ref name=\"tunnel\" />\n\nA breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in [[Connecticut]], proposed a [[New England]] setting.<ref name=\"h157\">Hyland, p. 157</ref>  Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945,\n<blockquote>\nI began to see an attractive ensemble\u2014sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans\u2014a libel I was anxious to refute&nbsp;... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest.  Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.<ref name=\"turn\">Hammerstein, Oscar II. [https://www.nytimes.com/1945/04/15/archives/turns-on-a-carousel-an-account-of-adventures-in-setting-the-play.html?sq=carousel&scp=16&st=p \"Turns on a Carousel; an account of adventures in setting the play 'Liliom' to music].  ''The New York Times'', April 15, 1945, Arts and Leisure, p. X1.  Retrieved on December 20, 2010.  Fee for article.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed \"the tunnel\" of Moln\u00e1r's second act\u2014a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom's suicide\u2014followed by a dark ending.  They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom's motivation for the robbery to music.<ref name=\"tunnel\" />  Moln\u00e1r's opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down [[Giacomo Puccini]] when the great composer wished to transform ''Liliom'' into an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini's.<ref name=\"n153\" />  In 1937, Moln\u00e1r, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from [[Kurt Weill]] to adapt the play into a musical.<ref name=\"Hyland, p. 158\" />\n\nThe pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a ''Liliom'' adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944\u2014writing the film musical ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]''<ref>Nolan, pp. 144\u201345</ref> and producing ''[[I Remember Mama (play)|I Remember Mama]]'' on Broadway.<ref>Fordin, pp. 223\u201324</ref>  Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Moln\u00e1r to see ''Oklahoma!''  Moln\u00e1r stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt ''Liliom'' as beautifully as they had modified ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', he would be pleased to have them do it.<ref>Fordin, pp. 221\u201322</ref>  The Guild obtained the rights from Moln\u00e1r in October 1943.  The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for \"personal services\".<ref>Hyland, pp. 157\u201358</ref>  The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Moln\u00e1r permit them to make changes in the plot.  At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded.  Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, \"we could never have made ''Carousel''.\"<ref>Secrest, p. 273</ref>\n\nIn seeking to establish through song Liliom's motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in ''Pal Joey''.  Rodgers and Hart had  overcome the problem  with a song that Joey sings to himself, \"I'm Talking to My Pal\".  This inspired \"[[Soliloquy (song)|Soliloquy]]\".  Both partners later told a story that \"Soliloquy\" was only intended to be a song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl.  However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: \"Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.\"<ref name=\"edsel\">Fordin, pp. 156\u201357</ref>\n\n[[File:Liliom prologue.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The opening carnival scene in ''Liliom'' inspired the [[Mime artist|pantomime]] that begins ''Carousel''; 1921]]\nHammerstein and Rodgers returned to the ''Liliom'' project in mid-1944.  Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Moln\u00e1r would disapprove of the results.<ref name=\"Fordin, p. 224\" />  ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' had been a little-known work; ''Liliom'' was a theatrical standard.  Moln\u00e1r's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society.  A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy.<ref name=\"Hyland, p. 158\" />  Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers.  He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in ''Liliom''; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge.<ref>Hyland, pp. 158\u201359</ref>  \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" was repurposed from a song, \"A Real Nice Hayride\", written for ''Oklahoma!'' but not used.<ref name=\"b162\">Block, p. 162</ref>\n\nMoln\u00e1r's ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical.  According to [[Frederick Nolan]] in his book on the team's works: \"From that scene the song \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]\" sprang almost naturally.\"<ref name=\"n157\">Nolan, p. 157</ref>  In spite of Hammerstein's simple lyrics for \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music.<ref>Block (ed.), p. 184</ref>  Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,\n<blockquote>\n''Liliom'' was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people.  The way Moln\u00e1r wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless.  We couldn't accept that.  The way we ended ''Carousel'' it may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others.<ref>Block (ed.), p. 180</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen the pair decided to make \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter.  Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, \"First came codfish chowder\".  However, further research convinced him the proper term was \"codhead chowder\", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers.  He decided to keep it as \"codfish\".  When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line \"We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good\".  He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front.  The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back.  Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back.  One error not caught involved the song \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring\u2014they actually do so in the winter.  Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.<ref>Fordin, pp. 227\u201328</ref>\n\nRodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves.<ref>Fordin, p. 222</ref>  In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical's small orchestra.  He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a [[Mime artist|pantomime]] scene accompanied by what became known as \"The Carousel Waltz\".<ref>Rodgers, p. 239</ref>  The pantomime paralleled one in the Moln\u00e1r play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience.<ref name=\"h161\" /> Author [[Ethan Mordden]] described the effectiveness of this opening:\n<blockquote>\nOther characters catch our notice\u2014Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat.  But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy\u2014the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy's spiel.  And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture ''and'' the opening number but the exposition as well.  They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.<ref>Mordden, p. 75</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Casting and out-of-town tryouts ===\nThe casting for ''Carousel'' began when ''Oklahoma!'''s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly (the male lead in ''Oklahoma!'').  Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a California singer named [[John Raitt]], who might be suitable for the part.  Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition.  Raitt asked to sing \"[[Largo al factotum]]\", Figaro's aria from ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', to warm up.  The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly, they had found a Liliom (or Billy Bigelow, as the part was renamed).<ref name=\"Block ed., p. 122\">Block (ed.), p. 122</ref>  Theresa Helburn made another California discovery, [[Jan Clayton]], a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for [[MGM]].  She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie.<ref name=\"n157\" />\n\nThe producers sought to cast unknowns.  Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of ''Pal Joey''), had ever played on Broadway before.<ref name=\"n157\" />  It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war\u2014Rodgers told his casting director, [[John Fearnley]], that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive.<ref>Secrest, p. 277</ref>  Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made ''Oklahoma!'' a success, including director [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]].  [[Miles White]] was the costume designer while [[Jo Mielziner]] (who had not worked on ''Oklahoma!'') was the scenic and lighting designer.  Even though ''Oklahoma!'' orchestrator [[Russell Bennett]] had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on ''Carousel'' due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time.  He orchestrated \"The Carousel Waltz\" and \"(When I Marry) Mister Snow\" before finally being replaced by [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]].<ref>Fordin, p. 231</ref>  A new member of the creative team was [[Trude Rittmann]], who arranged the dance music.  Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers' shows until the 1970s.<ref name=\"h161\">Hyland, p. 161</ref>\n\n[[File:Hammerstein.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Hammerstein in middle age, seated, wearing a suit|Oscar Hammerstein II]]\n\nRehearsals began in January 1945;<ref name=\"Hyland, p. 158\" /> either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present.<ref>Fordin, p. 232</ref> Raitt was presented with the lyrics for \"Soliloquy\" on a five-foot long sheet of paper\u2014the piece ran nearly eight minutes.  Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed.<ref name=\"god\">Secrest, p. 276</ref>  At some point during rehearsals, Moln\u00e1r came to see what they had done to his play.  There are a number of variations on the story.<ref name=\"Block ed., p. 122\" /><ref>Fordin, pp. 231\u201332</ref>  As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Moln\u00e1r in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner.  Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right.  At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Moln\u00e1r.  Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, \"What you have done is so beautiful.  And you know what I like best?  The ending!\"<ref>Rodgers, pp. 240\u201341</ref>  Hammerstein wrote that Moln\u00e1r became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.<ref name=\"turn\" />\n\nLike most of the pair's works, ''Carousel'' contains a lengthy ballet, \"Billy Makes a Journey\",<ref>Hischak, pp. 21\u201322</ref> in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from \"Up There\" and observes his daughter.  In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille.<ref>Hischak, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with the village women gathered for a \"birthing\".  The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots.  The focus was on Louise, played by [[Bambi Linn]], who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood.  She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billy's world.  A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her.  After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a children's party, where she is shunned.  The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children's party, with Louise lost between the two groups.  At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies.<ref name=\"agnes\">Easton, pp. 243\u201345.</ref>\n\nThe play opened for tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] on March 22, 1945.  The first act was well-received; the second act was not.<ref name=\"f233\">Fordin, p. 233</ref>  Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"n157\" />  The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference.  Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result.  John Fearnley commented, \"Now I see why these people have hits.  I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.\"<ref name=\"f233\" />  De Mille said of this conference, \"not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished.  Nor was there any idle joking.&nbsp;... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed.\"<ref>Block (ed.), p. 132</ref>  By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.<ref name=\"agnes\" />\n\nA major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers \"Mr. and Mrs. God\"),<ref>Block, p. 160</ref> before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor.<ref name=\"god\" /><ref>Block (ed.), p. 129.  At this time, according to the cast sheet distributed during the Boston run, Dr. Seldon was listed as the \"Minister\".</ref> The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening.<ref name=\"god\" /> Rodgers said to Hammerstein, \"We've got to get God out of that parlor\". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, \"I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!\" Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder,<ref>Block, pp. 161\u201362</ref> and Mrs. God was removed from the show.<ref name=\"god\" /> Rodgers biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by ''[[The New Republic]]'' as \"a [[Rotary International|Rotarian]] atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth\".<ref name=\"god\" />\n\nHammerstein wrote that Moln\u00e1r's advice, to combine two scenes into one, was key to pulling together the second act and represented \"a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made\".<ref name=\"turn\" />  A reprise of \"If I Loved You\" was added in the second act, which Rodgers felt needed more music.<ref>Rodgers, p. 241</ref>  Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception.<ref name=\"f233\" />  An even shorter version of the ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final night there, de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her.<ref name=\"agnes\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nTwo young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (\"The Carousel Waltz\").  When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin.  Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive (\"You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan\"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow (\"(When I Marry) Mister Snow\"), to whom she is newly engaged.  Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other (\"[[If I Loved You]]\").\n\n[[File:Mister Snow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Enoch (Eric Mattson) arrives unexpectedly (reprise of \"(When I Marry) Mister Snow\").  [[Iva Withers]] is Julie (standing), and Margot Moser is Carrie (bent over) (1947).]]\nOver a month passes, and preparations for the summer clambake are under way (\"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\"). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie's cousin Nettie's spa.  Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news\u2014she is engaged to Enoch, who enters as she discusses him (\"(When I Marry) Mister Snow (reprise))\".  Billy arrives with his ne'er-do-well whaler friend, Jigger.  The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie.  Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having (\"When the Children Are Asleep\").\n\nJigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the sea (\"Blow High, Blow Low\").  The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim\u2014Julie's former boss, Mr. Bascombe\u2014might have to be killed.  Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her).  He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single.  Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave.  She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel.  Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.\u2014until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that \"you've got to be a ''father'' to a girl\" (\"[[Soliloquy (song)|Soliloquy]]\").  Determined to provide financially for his future child, whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.\n\nThe whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused to go, agrees to join in, to Julie's delight, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger's alibi (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n[[File:Use of Wondering.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|\"What's the Use of Wond'rin'&nbsp;\"; Withers is Julie (1947)]]\nEveryone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (\"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\").  Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, and declares that he is finished with her (\"Geraniums In the Winder\"), as Jigger jeers (\"There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman\"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that \"he's your feller and you love him\" (\"What's the Use of Wond'rin'?\").  Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt.  She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.\n\nAs they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards.  They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's money.  The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die.  Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him.  Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]\").\n\nBilly's defiant spirit (\"The Highest Judge of All\") is taken Up There<!-- as described in the libretto --> to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official.  The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself.  He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since his suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise.  He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: \"Billy Makes a Journey\"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter.  The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater.  In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.  The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter.  He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.\n\nOutside Julie's cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch.  Carrie's husband and their many children enter to fetch her\u2014the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day.  Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind  to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters.  Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe.  He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged:  each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away.  Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father.  He offers her a gift\u2014the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand.  He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow\u2014and Julie understands her perfectly.  Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy's presence (\"If I Loved You (Reprise)\").\n\nBilly invisibly attends Louise's graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise).  Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".  Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast.  Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her.

The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working.<ref name=\"agnes\" />  Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain.  Sedated with morphine, he could see only part of the stage.  As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure.  It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause.<ref name=\"r243\">Rodgers, p. 243</ref>  [[Bambi Linn]], who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow.

In later years, Rodgers was asked if he had considered writing an opera.  He stated that he had been sorely tempted to, but saw ''Carousel'' in operatic terms.  He remembered, \"We came very close to opera in the Majestic Theatre.&nbsp;... There's much that is operatic in the music.\"<ref name=\"stream\">Secrest, p. 275</ref>\n\n[[File:Rodgers.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of Rodgers, in middle age, seated in a theatre, wearing a suit and holding a cigarette|Richard Rodgers]]\nRodgers uses music in ''Carousel'' in subtle ways to differentiate characters and tell the audience of their emotional state.<ref>Block, pp. 164\u201365</ref> In \"You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan\", the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even [[eighth-note]] rhythms, whereas the emotionally restless Julie's music is marked by [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighths and [[Sixteenth note|sixteenths]]; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show. When Billy whistles a snatch of the song, he selects Julie's dotted notes rather than Carrie's.<ref>Block, p. 167</ref> Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as-yet unborn Louise, when Billy sings in \"Soliloquy\" of his daughter, who \"gets hungry every night\", he uses Julie's dotted rhythms. Such rhythms also characterize Julie's Act 2 song, \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\".<ref>Block, p. 168</ref> The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life, but hers as well. This is reflected in \"When the Children Are Asleep\", where the two sing in [[close harmony]], but Enoch musically interrupts his intended's turn at the chorus with the words \"Dreams that won't be interrupted\". Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block, in his book on the Broadway musical, points out that though Billy may strike his wife, he allows her musical themes to become a part of him and never interrupts her music.<ref>Block, p. 174</ref> Block suggests that, as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions, Enoch requiring Carrie to act as \"the little woman\", and his having nine children with her (more than she had found acceptable in \"When the Children are Asleep\") can be considered to be even more abusive.<ref>Block, pp. 174\u201375</ref>\n\nThe twelve-minute \"bench scene\",<ref name=\"h129\">Hischak, p. 129</ref> in which Billy and Julie get to know each other and which culminates with \"[[If I Loved You]]\", according to Hischak, \"is considered the most completely integrated piece of music-drama in the American musical theatre\".<ref name=\"h38\" />  The scene is almost entirely drawn from Moln\u00e1r and is one extended musical piece; [[Stephen Sondheim]] described it as \"probably the single most important moment in the revolution of contemporary musicals\".<ref>Nolan, p. 159</ref>  \"If I Loved You\" has been recorded many times, by such diverse artists as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mario Lanza]] and [[Chad and Jeremy]].<ref name=\"h129\" />  The D-flat major theme that dominates the music for the second act ballet seems like a new melody to many audience members.  It is, however, a greatly expanded development of a theme heard during \"Soliloquy\" at the line \"I guess he'll call me 'The old man'&nbsp;\".<ref>Mordden, p. 142</ref>\n\nWhen the pair discussed the song that would become \"Soliloquy\", Rodgers improvised at the piano to give Hammerstein an idea of how he envisioned the song.  When Hammerstein presented his collaborator with the lyrics after two weeks of work (Hammerstein always wrote the words first, then Rodgers would write the melodies), Rodgers wrote the music for the eight-minute song in two hours.<ref name=\"eight\">Fordin, p. 239</ref>  \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'&nbsp;\", one of Julie's songs, worked well in the show but was never as popular on the radio or for recording, and Hammerstein believed that the lack of popularity was because he had concluded the final line, \"And all the rest is talk\" with a hard consonant, which does not allow the singer a vocal climax.<ref name=\"eight\" />\n\n[[File:Shankly Gates.jpg|thumb|Shankly Gates at [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s stadium]]\n[[Irving Berlin]] later stated that \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" had the same sort of effect on him as [[Psalm 23|the 23rd Psalm]].<ref>Nolan, p. 162</ref>  When singer [[Mel Torm\u00e9]] told Rodgers that \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" had made him cry, Rodgers nodded impatiently.  \"You're supposed to.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 163</ref>  The frequently recorded song has become a widely accepted hymn.<ref name=\"Bradley79\">Bradley, p. 79</ref><ref>Rodgers, p. 240</ref>  The cast recording of ''Carousel'' proved popular in Liverpool, like many Broadway albums, and in 1963, the [[Brian Epstein]]-managed band, [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] had a number-one hit with the song.

Some critics have suggested that unlike [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] and older [[Christian rock]], Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic,<ref name=\"Guila_6_50\">{{cite book |last=Gulla |first=Bob |title=The Greenwood Encycloepdia of Rock History, Volume Six |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=[[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], [[Connecticut]] |isbn=0-313-32981-8 |pages=101\u2013102}}</ref> though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.\n\n==History==\nChristian alternative music has its roots in the early 1980s, as the earliest efforts at [[Christian punk]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] were recorded by artists like Andy McCarroll and Moral Support, [[Undercover (band)|Undercover]], [[The 77s]], [[Steve Scott (poet)|Steve Scott]], [[Adam Again]], [[Quickflight]], [[Daniel Amos]], Youth Choir (later renamed [[The Choir (alternative rock band)|The Choir]]), [[Lifesavers Underground]], [[Michael Knott]], [[The Altar Boys]], [[Breakfast with Amy]], [[Steve Taylor]], [[4-4-1]], David Edwards and [[Vector (band)|Vector]]. Early labels, most now-defunct, included [[Blonde Vinyl]], [[Frontline Records|Frontline]], [[Exit Records|Exit]], and [[Refuge Records|Refuge]].<ref name=\"Guila_6_50\"/>\n\nBy the 1990s, many of these bands and artists had disbanded, were no longer performing, or were being carried by independent labels because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream [[contemporary Christian music|Christian pop]]. The modern market is currently supported by labels such as [[Tooth & Nail Records|Tooth & Nail]], [[Gotee Records|Gotee]] and [[Floodgate Records|Floodgate]]. These companies are often children of, or partially owned, by general market labels such as [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], [[EMI]], and [[Capitol Records]], giving successful artists an opportunity to \"cross over\" into mainstream markets.\n\n==See also==\n*[[7ball]]\n*[[HM: The Hard Music Magazine]]\n*[[True Tunes News]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0122,sandler,25149,1.html God Save the Teens: Local Kids Seek a New Kind of Church Through Hardcore and Hip-Hop] by Lauren Sandler in the [[Village Voice]] 30 May - 5 June 2001\n\n{{Christian music articles}}\n{{Alternative rock}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christian Alternative Rock}}\n[[Category:20th-century music genres]]\n[[Category:Alternative rock genres]]\n[[Category:Christian rock genres|Alternative]]", "sha1": "pwv3nknfya4far3lwr89543xzkl8yyn"}}, {"title": "Clive Barker", "ns": "0", "id": "7573", "revision": {"id": "863177367", "parentid": "863177058", "timestamp": "2018-10-09T04:59:14Z", "contributor": {"ip": "81.100.53.96"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About||the English pop artist|Clive Barker (artist)|the South African coach|Clive Barker (soccer)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2017}}\n{{BLP sources|date=November 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name       = Clive Barker\n| image      = CliveBarker.jpg\n| image_size = 230px\n| caption    = Barker at the [[EMP Museum|Science Fiction Museum]] in 2007\n| pseudonym  =\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1952|10|5|df=y}}\n| birth_place= [[Liverpool]], England\n| nationality= British\n| occupation = Author, film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, playwright, painter, [[illustrator]] and [[visual artist]]\n| death_date =\n| death_place=\n| genre      = [[Horror fiction|Horror]], [[fantasy]]\n| movement   =\n| net worth  = \n<!-- Infobox writer no longer supports the fields influences and influenced.

He wrote the screenplays for ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), both directed by [[George Pavlou]]. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), based on his novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' (1995). The short story \"The Forbidden\", from Barker's ''Books of Blood'', provided the basis for the 1992 film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' and its two sequels. Barker was an executive producer of the film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quintet'' books under Disney's management, but because of creative differences, the project was cancelled.\n\nIn 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company Midnight Picture Show with the intent of producing two horror films per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/05/26/clive-barker-form-midnight-picture-show-16153|title=Clive Barker to form Midnight Picture Show|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original ''Hellraiser'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel15.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Revelations Interview 15|publisher=Clivebarker.info|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222050653/http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=2994 |date=22 February 2008 }}</ref> He is developing a film based on his ''[[Tortured Souls]]'' line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]].\n\n==Visual art==\nBarker is a prolific visual artist, often illustrating his own books.

Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as [[low fantasy]] in contrast to [[high fantasy]], which is primarily serious in intent and tone.  The term \"low fantasy\" is used to represent other types of fantasy, however, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature.\n\n==Literature==\nThe subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of comic fantasy can be found in such nineteenth century works\nas some of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tales, [[Charles Dickens]]' \"Christmas Books\", and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] books.<ref name=\"pringle\">\"Humourous Fantasy\" in [[David Pringle]],ed, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', (pp.31-33).

The work of [[Fritz Leiber]] also appeared in ''Unknown Worlds'', including his [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] stories, a jocose take on the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre.<ref name=\"pringle\" />\n\nIn more modern times, [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' books, [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Xanth]]'' books, [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[MythAdventures]]'' of Skeeve and Aahz books, and [[Tom Holt]]'s books provide good examples,<ref name=\"pringle\" /> as do many of the works by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including [[Chuck Whelon]]'s Pewfell series and the webcomics ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'' and ''[[The Order of the Stick]]''. Other recent authors in the genre include Toby Frost, Stuart Sharp, Nicholas Andrews, and DC Farmer, and the writing team of John P. Logsdon and Christopher P. Young.\n\n==Other media==\nThe subgenre has also been represented in [[Fantasy television|television]], such as in the television series ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon]]''. Examples on radio are the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'' and ''[[ElvenQuest]]''. Comic fantasy films can either be parodies (''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''), comedies with fantastical elements (''[[Being John Malkovich]]'') or animated (''[[Shrek]]'').

While it did not find extensive use, it introduced many features that are used widely now, and is seen as a step in the development of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP).\n\nKey contributions include [[abstract data type]]s,<ref>{{Cite conference |doi= 10.1145/800233.807045 |chapter= Programming with abstract data types |title= Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Very high level languages |pages= 50\u201359 |year= 1974 |last1= Liskov |first1= Barbara |authorlink1= Barbara Liskov |last2= Zilles |first2= Stephen |ref= harv|citeseerx= 10.1.1.136.3043 }}</ref> [[call-by-sharing]], [[iterator]]s, multiple return values (a form of [[parallel assignment]]), type-safe [[parameterized type]]s, and type-safe [[variant type]]s. It is also notable for its use of [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] with [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]] and methods, but without [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].\n\n== Clusters ==\nThe [[syntax]] of CLU was based on [[ALGOL]], then the starting point for most new language designs. The key addition was the concept of a ''cluster'', CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster).<ref name=Liskov1977>{{Cite journal |last1= Liskov |first1= B. |authorlink1= Barbara Liskov |last2= Snyder |first2= A. |last3= Atkinson |first3= R. |last4= Schaffert |first4= C. |title= Abstraction mechanisms in CLU |doi= 10.1145/359763.359789 |journal= [[Communications of the ACM]] |volume= 20 |issue= 8 |pages= 564\u2013576 |date=August 1977 |citeseerx=10.1.1.112.656 }}</ref> Clusters correspond generally to the concept of a \"class\" in an OO language, and have similar syntax. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements [[complex number]]s:\n<!-- Not actually Algol 68, but this attribute is required-->\n<pre>\n    complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ...\n        rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]\n        add = proc ... end add;\n        subtract = proc ... end subtract;\n        multiply = proc ... end multiply;\n        ...\n    end complex_number;\n</pre>\n\nA cluster is a module that encapsulates all of its components except for those explicitly named in the \"is\" clause. These correspond to the public components of a class in recent OO languages. A cluster also defines a type that can be named outside the cluster (in this case, \"complex_number\"), but its representation type (rep) is hidden from external clients.\n\nCluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created \"locally\" inside other clusters.\n\nCLU does not perform implicit type conversions. In a cluster, the explicit type conversions ''up'' and ''down'' change between the abstract type and the representation. There is a universal type ''any'', and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being ''base types'' such as integers, booleans, characters and strings.<ref name=Liskov1977/>\n\n== Other features ==\nAnother key feature of the CLU type system are ''[[iterator]]s'', which return objects from a collection serially, one after another.<ref name=Liskov1977 /> Iterators offer an identical [[application programming interface]] (API) no matter what data they are being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of <code>complex_number</code>s can be used interchangeably with that for an array of <code>integer</code>s. A distinctive feature of CLU iterators is that they are implemented as coroutines, with each value being provided to the caller via a ''yield'' statement. Iterators like those in CLU are now a common feature of many modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, and Python, though recently they are often referred to as generators.\n\nCLU also includes [[exception handling]], based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using <code>signal</code> and handled with <code>except</code>. Unlike most other languages with exception handling, exceptions are not implicitly resignaled up the calling chain. Also unlike most other languages that provide exception handling, exceptions in CLU are considered part of ordinary execution flow and are considered a \"normal\" and efficient typesafe way to break out of loops or return from functions; this allows for direct assignment of return values \"except when\" other conditions apply. Exceptions that are neither caught nor resignaled explicitly are immediately converted into a special failure exception that typically terminates the program.\n\nCLU is often credited as being the first language with type-safe [[variant type]]s, called ''oneofs'', before the language [[ML (programming language)|ML]] had them.\n\nA final distinctive feature in CLU is [[parallel assignment]] (multiple assignment), where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] operator. For instance, writing <code>x,y := y,x</code> would exchange values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. In the same way, functions could return several values, like <code>x,y,z := f(t)</code>. Parallel assignment (though not multiple return values) predates CLU, appearing in [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]] (1963), named ''simultaneous assignment'',<ref>{{cite journal |first1= D.

Due to the years of [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet military]] buildup at the expense of domestic development, economic growth stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe.<ref>WorldBook online</ref>\n\nGreater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], created an atmosphere of open criticism of the [[Communist state|communist regime]].

The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple [[Perestroika|reform-minded]] Gorbachev.\n\n==Leadership transition==\nBy 1982, the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible. A huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy. The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.\n\n===Andropov interregnum===\nBrezhnev died on 10 November 1982. Two days passed between his death and the announcement of the election of [[Yuri Andropov]] as the new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], suggesting to many outsiders that a power struggle had occurred in the Kremlin. Andropov maneuvered his way into power both through his KGB connections and by gaining the support of the military by promising not to cut defense spending. For comparison, some of his rivals such as Konstantin Chernenko were skeptical of a continued high military budget. Aged 69, he was the oldest person ever appointed as General Secretary and 11 years older than Brezhnev when he acquired that post. In June 1983, he assumed the post of chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thus becoming the ceremonial [[head of state]]. It had taken Brezhnev 13 years to acquire this post. Andropov began a thorough house-cleaning throughout the party and state bureaucracy, a decision made easy by the fact that the Central Committee had an average age of 69. He replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. As a result, he replaced the aging leadership with younger, more vigorous administrators. But Andropov's ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his own age and poor health and the influence of his rival (and longtime ally of Leonid Brezhnev) [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who had previously supervised personnel matters in the Central Committee.\n\nThe transition of power from Brezhnev to Andropov was notably the first one in Soviet history to occur completely peacefully with no one being imprisoned, killed, or forced from office.\n\nAndropov's domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with the late [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]'s initiatives [[1965 Soviet economic reform|in the mid-1960s]]. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an anti-corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Unlike Brezhnev, who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars, he lived quite simply. While visiting [[Budapest]] in early 1983, he expressed interest in [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s [[Goulash Communism]] and that the sheer size of the Soviet economy made strict top-down planning impractical. Changes were needed in a hurry for 1982 had witnessed the country's worst economic performance since [[World War II]], with real [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth at almost zero percent.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Andropov continued Brezhnev's policies. US\u2212Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly beginning in March 1983, when US President [[Ronald Reagan]] dubbed the Soviet Union an \"[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". The official press agency TASS accused Reagan of \"thinking only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism\". Further deterioration occurred as a result of the 1 Sep 1983 Soviet shootdown of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] near [[Moneron Island]] carrying 269 people including a sitting US congressman, [[Larry McDonald]], and over Reagan's stationing of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. In [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], [[Nicaragua]] and elsewhere, under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the US began undermining Soviet-supported governments by supplying arms to [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] resistance movements in these countries.\n\nPresident Reagan's decision to deploy medium-range [[Pershing II]] missiles in Western Europe met with mass protests in countries such as France and West Germany, sometimes numbering 1 million people at a time. Many Europeans became convinced that the US and not the Soviet Union was the more aggressive country, and there was fear over the prospect of a war, especially since there was a widespread conviction in Europe that the US, being separated from the Red Army by two oceans as opposed to a short land border, was insensitive to the people of Germany and other countries. Moreover, the memory of World War II was still strong and many Germans could not forget the destruction and mass rapes committed by Soviet troops in the closing days of that conflict. This attitude was helped along by the Reagan Administration's comments that a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would not necessarily result in the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAndropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he became the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. Did Andropov really not attend the 7 November 1983 parade? There are some speculations that show he did attend|date=August 2009}} He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months. His most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.\n\n===Chernenko interregnum===\nAt 71, [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was in poor health, suffering from emphysema, and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But Chernenko's short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into corruption undertaken under Andropov's tutelage came to an end. Chernenko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture. He also called for a reduction in the CPSU's micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB repression of Soviet dissidents also increased. In February 1983, Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Organization in protest of that group's continued complaints about the use of psychiatry to suppress dissent. This policy was underlined in June when Vladimir Danchev, a broadcaster for Radio Moscow, referred to the Soviet troops in Afghanistan as \"invaders\" while conducting English-language broadcasts. After refusing to retract this statement, he was sent to a mental institution for several months. Valery Senderov, a leader of an unofficial union of professional workers, was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp early in the year for speaking out on discrimination practiced against Jews in education and the professions.\n\nAlthough Chernenko had called for renewed ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' with the West, little progress was made towards closing the rift in East\u2212West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, retaliating for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. In September 1984,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/07/world/honecker-s-west-german-visit-divided-meaning.html?pagewanted=all Honecker's West German Visit: Divided Meaning], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 September 1987</ref> the Soviet Union also prevented a visit to [[West Germany]] by [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]]. Fighting in the [[Afghan Democratic Republic]] also intensified, but in the late autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.\n\n==Rise of Gorbachev==\nThe war in Afghanistan, often referred to as the Soviet Union's \"Vietnam War\",<ref name=\"Tamarov 1992\">{{cite book |first=Vladislav |last=Tamarov |title=Afghanistan: Soviet Vietnam |publisher=Mercury House |year=1992 |isbn=1-56279-021-8}}</ref> led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. The reasoning may be true but please list at least one valid source rather than the title of a book about an individual's experience as a soldier in Afghanistan|date=April 2013}} Also, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.\n\n== Changing of the guard ==\n\nAfter years of stagnation, the \"new thinking\" (Anatoli Cherniaev, 2008: 131) of younger Communist apparatchik began to emerge. Following the death of terminally ill Konstantin Chernenko, the Politburo elected Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in March 1985. At 54, Gorbachev was the youngest person since [[Joseph Stalin]] to become General Secretary and the country's first head of state born a Soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar. During his official confirmation on March 11, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke of how the new Soviet leader had filled in for Chernenko as CC Secretariat, and praised his intelligence and flexible, pragmatic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology. Gorbachev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the Politburo. He immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts, including [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], Secretary of Economics, Viktor Cherbrikov, KGB Chief, Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (replacing the 75-year-old Gromyko), Secretary of Defense Industries [[Lev Zaikov]], and Secretary of Construction [[Boris Yeltsin]]. Removed from the Politburo and Secretariat was [[Grigory Romanov]], who had been Gorbachev's most significant rival for the position of General Secretary. Gromyko's removal as Foreign Minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of unflinching, faithful service compared to the unknown, inexperienced Shevardnadze.\n\nMore predictably, the 80-year-old [[Nikolai Tikhonov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]], was succeeded by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], the acting [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], was succeeded by [[Andrei Gromyko]], the former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].\n\nFurther down the chain, up to 40% of the first secretaries of the ''oblasts'' (provinces) were replaced with younger, better educated, and more competent men. The defense establishment was also given a thorough shakeup with the commanders of all 16 military districts replaced along with all theaters of military operation, as well as the three Soviet fleets. Not since World War II had the Soviet military had such a rapid turnover of officers. Sixty-eight-year-old Marshal [[Nikolai Ogarkov]] was fully rehabilitated after having fallen from favor in 1983\u201384 due to his handling of the [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|KAL 007]] shootdown and his ideas about improving Soviet strategic and tactical doctrines were made into an official part of defense policy, although some of his other ambitions such as developing the military into a smaller, tighter force based on advanced technology were not considered feasible for the time being. Many, but not all, of the younger army officers appointed during 1985 were proteges of Ogarkov.\n\nGorbachev got off to an excellent start during his first months in power. He projected an aura of youth and dynamism compared to his aged predecessors and made frequent walks in the streets of the major cities answering questions from ordinary citizens. He became the first leader that spoke with the [[Soviet people]] in person. When he made public speeches, he made clear that he was interested in constructive exchanges of ideas instead of merely reciting lengthy platitudes about the excellence of the Soviet system. He also spoke candidly about the slackness and run-down condition of Soviet society in recent years, blaming [[alcohol abuse]], poor workplace discipline, and other factors for these situations. Alcohol was a particular nag of Gorbachev's, especially as he himself did not drink, and he made one of his major policy aims curbing the consumption of it.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, the most important one, relations with the United States, remained twitchy through 1985. In October, Gorbachev made his first visit to a non-communist country when he traveled to France and was warmly received. The fashion-conscious French were also captivated by his wife Raisa and political pundits widely believed that the comparatively young Soviet leader would have a PR advantage over President Reagan, who was 20 years his senior.\n\nReagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in [[Geneva]] in November. The three weeks preceding the summit meeting were marked by an unprecedented Soviet media campaign against the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), taking advantage of opposition at home in the US to the program. When it finally took place, the two superpower leaders established a solid rapport that boded well for the future despite Reagan's refusal to compromise on abandonment of SDI. A joint communique by both parties stated that they were in agreement that nuclear war could not be won by either side and must never be allowed to happen. It was also agreed that Reagan and Gorbachev would carry out two more summit meetings in 1986\u201387.\n\n[[Jimmy Carter]] had officially ended the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]], by financially aiding the [[Mujahideen]] movement in neighboring [[Socialist Afghanistan]], which served as a pretext for the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]] six months later, with the aims of supporting the Afghan government, controlled by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]. Tensions between the superpowers increased during this time, when Carter placed trade embargoes on the Soviet Union and stated that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was \"the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.\"<ref name=\"State of the Union Address, 1980\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec/ | author = Carter, Jimmy | title = State of the Union Address, 1980 | publisher = Jimmy Carter Library and Museum | accessdate = 12 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nEast-West tensions increased during the first term of U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981\u201385), reaching levels not seen since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] as Reagan increased US military spending to 7% of the GDP.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To match the USA's military buildup, the Soviet Union increased its own military spending to 27% of its GDP and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels, causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing Soviet economy. However, it is not clear where the number 27% of the GDP{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} came from. This thesis is not confirmed by the extensive study on the causes of the dissolution of the Soviet Union by two prominent economists from the World Bank\u2014[[William Easterly]] and [[Stanley Fischer]] from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"\u2026 the study concludes that the increased Soviet defense spending provoked by Mr. Reagan's policies was not the straw that broke the back of the Empire. The Afghan war and the Soviet response to Mr. Reagan's Star Wars program caused only a relatively small rise in defense costs. And the defense effort throughout the period from 1960 to 1987 contributed only marginally to economic decline.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/worldbusiness/17iht-think_2.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Many Can Learn From Soviet Downfall | first=Reginald | last=Dale | date=17 June 1994 | accessdate=25 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nEconomically, the soviet leaders attempted to adopt the [[Chinese economic reform|Chinese option]]\u2014economic liberalization with preservation of political system instead of the [[Shock therapy (economics)]] that was going on in Latin America and Poland. However, Gorbachev's reforms did not work because the Soviet Union economy was almost 80% state owned compared to the 20\u201330% in China. The gradual opening of markets was too slow and not deep enough to leave any significant economic reforms until it was too late to prevent the collapse of the USSR.\n\nThe US financed the training for the [[Mujahideen]] warlords such as [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]], [[Gulbudin Hekmatyar]] and [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] eventually culminated to the fall of the Soviet satellite the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGjAsQJh7OM&feature=channel|title=Brzezinski and the Afghan War  Pt2|date=15 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>  While the CIA and MI6 and the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China financed the operation along with the Pakistan government against the Soviet Union,<ref>S.

US President Reagan also actively hindered the Soviet Union's ability to sell natural gas to Europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low, which kept the price of Soviet oil low and further starved the Soviet Union of foreign capital.  This \"long-term strategic offensive,\" which \"contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of \"[[containment]]\", accelerated the fall of the Soviet Union by encouraging it to overextend its economic base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm |title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan |publisher=Wais.stanford.edu |accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref> The proposition that special operations by the CIA in Saudi Arabia affected the prices of Soviet oil was refuted by [[Marshall Goldman]]\u2014one of the leading experts on the economy of the Soviet Union\u2014in his latest book. He pointed out that the Saudis decreased their production of oil in 1985 (it reached a 16-year low), whereas [[1980s oil glut|the peak of oil production]] was reached in 1980. They increased the production of oil in 1986, reduced it in 1987 with a subsequent increase in 1988, but not to the levels of 1980 when production reached its highest level. The real increase happened in 1990, by which time the Cold War was almost over. In his book he asked why, if Saudi Arabia had such an effect on Soviet oil prices, did prices not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by Saudi Arabia reached its highest level\u2014three times as much oil as in the mid-eighties\u2014and why did the Saudis wait till 1990 to increase their production, five years after the CIA's supposed intervention?

In 1972, Nixon normalized US relations with China, thus creating pressure on the Soviet Union.

For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.\n\n''Glasnost'' resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled. Thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were also released.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits, including conducting public opinion polls.

The first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed Institute for the Socio\u2212Economic Study of Human Population.\n\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi-candidate elections into the Soviet political process.

To proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party, Gorbachev aimed to consolidate power in a new position, [[President of the Soviet Union]], which was independent from the CPSU and the soviets (councils) and whose holder could be impeached only in case of direct violation of the law.<ref>[http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/people/?pid=226 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f | \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 | \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227214102/http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/people/?pid=226 |date=27 February 2008 }}</ref> On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive president.

Initially intended as tools to bolster the Soviet economy, the policies of ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' soon led to [[unintended consequences]].\n\nRelaxation under ''glasnost'' resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the media. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, alcoholism, [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]], pollution, outdated Stalin-era factories, and petty to large-scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Soviet regime, such as the [[gulag]]s, [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|his treaty with Adolf Hitler]], and the [[Great Purges]], which had been ignored by the official media. Moreover, the ongoing [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]], and the mishandling of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.\n\nIn all, the positive view of Soviet life long presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight.<ref name=\"Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy\">Acton, Edward,, (1995) ''Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy'', Longmann Group Ltd (1995) {{ISBN|0-582-08922-0}}</ref> This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party's social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.\n\nFraying amongst the members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and instability of its western allies, first indicated by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]'s 1980 rise to leadership of the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its Eastern European satellite states for protection as a buffer zone. By 1989, following his doctrine of \"[[new political thinking]]\", Gorbachev had repudiated the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies (\"[[Sinatra Doctrine]]\"). Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact countries saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of [[Romania]], a [[Romanian Revolution|violent uprising]]. By 1990, the governments of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], all of which had been imposed after [[World War II]], were brought down as [[Revolutions of 1989|revolutions swept Eastern Europe]].\n\nThe Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequences of ''glasnost'' reverberated throughout the country. Despite efforts at containment, the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In elections to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, nationalists as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR's central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR's constituent republics had been largely undermined. Massive peaceful protests in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] such as the [[Baltic Way]] and the [[Singing Revolution]] drew international attention and bolstered independence movements in various other regions.\n\nThe rise of nationalism under ''freedom of speech'' soon re-awakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people. One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], passed a resolution calling for unification with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]]. Violence against local Azerbaijanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking [[Sumgait pogrom|massacres of Armenians]] in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumqayit|Sumgait]].\n\nEmboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of ''glasnost'', public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although ''perestroika'' was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country's chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.\n\nThe value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1990 in retail prices was about 459 billion rubles ($2.1 trillion).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JSwstF6SEAkC&pg=PA495&lpg=PA495&dq=ussr+output+ruble&source=bl&ots=V9GzYYG6fV&sig=FZpZnEpfYwmcNjTa4VX3SNbMjt0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ussr%20output%20ruble&f=false|title=The Former Soviet Union in Transition|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The anti\u2212alcohol campaign reduced tax revenues as well, which in 1982 accounted for about 12% of all state revenue. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier\u2212producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.\n\n==Dissolution of the USSR==\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}\nThe '''dissolution of the Soviet Union''' was a process of systematic [[Societal collapse|disintegration]], which occurred in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy]], social structure and [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political structure]]. It resulted in the abolition of the Soviet Federal Government (\"the Union center\") and independence of the USSR's republics on 25 December 1991. The process was caused by a weakening of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]], which led to disintegration and took place from about 19 January 1990 to 31 December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%205%20Option%20European%20History/The%20Dismantlement%20of%20the%20USSR.pdf|title=Welcome stbenedictcollege.org - BlueHost.com|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&pg=PR5&lpg=PR5&dq=26+december+1991+ussr&source=bl&ots=hxNfBDGN_P&sig=fAZWN5NzjiNnn8gO7SRV0x_YtrA&hl=it&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwir8Yuj7o3dAhWtx4UKHYzZCzMQ6AEwGXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=26%20december%201991%20ussr&f=false]</ref> The process was characterized by many of the [[republics of the Soviet Union]] declaring their independence and being recognized [[Post-Soviet states|as sovereign nation-states]].\n\nAndrei Grachev, the Deputy Head of the Intelligence Department of the Central Committee, summed up the denouement of the downfall quite cogently:\n\n\"Gorbachev actually put the sort of final blow to the resistance of the Soviet Union by killing the fear of the people. It was still that this country was governed and kept together, as a structure, as a government structure, by the fear from Stalinist times.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/sovietcollapse.htm|title=The Economic Collapse of the Soviet Union|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\nThe principal elements of the old Soviet political system were Communist Party dominance, the hierarchy of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]],  state socialism, and [[ethnic federalism]]. Gorbachev's programs of ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) and ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) produced radical unforeseen effects that brought that system down.<ref>{{Britannica|513251|Russia}}</ref> As a means of reviving the Soviet state, Gorbachev repeatedly attempted to build a coalition of political leaders supportive of reform and created new arenas and bases of power. He implemented these measures because he wanted to resolve serious economic problems and political inertia that clearly threatened to put the Soviet Union into a state of long-term stagnation.\n\nBut by using structural reforms to widen opportunities for leaders and popular movements in the union republics to gain influence, Gorbachev also made it possible for nationalist, orthodox communist, and populist forces to oppose his attempts to liberalize and revitalize Soviet communism. Although some of the new movements aspired to replace the Soviet system altogether with a liberal democratic one, others demanded independence for the national republics. Still others insisted on the restoration of the old Soviet ways. Ultimately, Gorbachev could not forge a compromise among these forces and the consequence was the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n==Post-Soviet restructuring==\n{{Main|History of Russia (1992\u2013present)}}\nTo restructure the Soviet administrative command system and implement a transition to a [[market economy]], Yeltsin's [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock program]] was employed within days of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The subsidies to money-losing farms and industries were cut, price controls abolished, and the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] moved towards [[convertibility]]. New opportunities for Yeltsin's circle and other entrepreneurs to seize former state property were created, thus restructuring the old state-owned economy within a few months.\n\nAfter obtaining power, the vast majority of \"idealistic\" reformers gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became [[business oligarch]]s in a manner that appeared antithetical to an emerging democracy. Existing institutions were conspicuously abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property, overseeing financial markets, and enforcing taxation.\n\nMarket economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise GDP and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge macroeconomic and structural distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.\n\nSince the USSR's collapse, Russia faced many problems that [[free market]] proponents in 1992 did not expect. Among other things, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line, life expectancy had fallen, birthrates were low, and the GDP was halved. There was a sharp increase in [[economic inequality]]: between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, the [[Gini ratio]] increased by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries.<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =Princeton| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly led to the election of Yeltsin's Communist challenger, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]]. In recent years, the economy of Russia has begun to improve greatly, due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold War (1985\u201391)]]\n* [[Predictions of the dissolution of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Reagan Doctrine]]\n* [[Revolutions of 1989]] (Eastern Europe)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Main|List of primary and secondary sources on the Cold War}}\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Carr\u00e8re d'Encausse]], ''The End of the Soviet Empire: The Triumph of the Nations'', Basic Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-465-09818-5}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Gaidar |first=Yegor |authorlink=Yegor Gaidar |date=19 April 2007 |title=The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil |journal=AEI Online |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722091512/http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}\n*{{Cite book| last=Gaidar| first=Yegor| authorlink=Yegor Gaidar| title=Gibel' Imperii: Uroki dlya sovremennoi Rossii [The Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia]| year=2006}}  <br /> {{cite book | last =  Gaidar | first = Yegor Gaidar | authorlink = Yegor Gaidar |others=[[Antonina W.

It is closely related to [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], and thus to Tuscan-based [[Italian language|Italian]]. In its Northern varieties especially, mutual intelligibility between Corsican and both Italian and Tuscan is high. Varieties of Corsican are spoken, and to some extent written, on the islands of [[Corsica]] ([[France]]) and northern [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). Corsican used to play the role of a [[vernacular]], while [[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by [[French language|French]], owing to the acquisition of the island by France from the [[Republic of Genoa]] in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s.

Such infinitival ending is [[Tuscan dialect#Loss of infinitival \"-re\"|lost in Tuscan]] as well as Corsican, which has ''mette'' / ''metta'', \"to put\". The Latin relative pronouns ''qui''/''quae'' \"who\", and ''quod'' \"what\", are [[inflected]] in Latin; whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for \"who\" is ''chi'' and \"what\" is ''che''/''(che) cosa'', it is an uninflected ''ch\u00ec'' in Corsican. The biggest difference between standard Italian and Corsican is that the latter uses the ''u'' termination, whereas standard Italian uses the ''o'' ending. For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns ''questo'' \"this\" and ''quello'' \"that\" become in Corsican ''questu'' or ''quistu'' and ''quellu'' or ''quiddu''. This feature was typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Corsican language has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers: [[Tuscany]] (828\u20131077), [[Pisa]] (1077\u20131282) and [[Genoa]] (1282\u20131768), more recently by France (1768\u2013present), which, since 1789, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term ''gallicised Corsican'' refers to Corsican up to about the year 1950. The term ''distanciated Corsican'' refers to an idealized Corsican from which various agents have removed French or other elements.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Corsican distanciation strategies: Language purification or misguided attempts to reverse the gallicisation process?|first=Robert J.|last=Blackwood|journal=Multilingua \u2013 Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage Communication|volume=23|issue=3|pages=233\u2013255|date=August 2004|format=PDF|url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/mult.2004.011?cookieSet=1|accessdate=2008-06-13|doi=10.1515/mult.2004.011}}</ref>\n\nThe common relationship between Corsica and central Italy can be traced as far back as the [[Etruscans]], who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC.<ref>Jehasse, Olivier. ''Corsica'' in ''Etruscology'' (Edited by Alessandro Naso), 2017</ref> In 40 AD, the natives of Corsica did not reportedly speak [[Latin]]. The Roman exile, [[Seneca the Younger]], reports that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he did not understand (see [[Prehistory of Corsica#Ligurian hypothesis|the Ligurian hypothesis]]). Whatever language was spoken is still visible in the toponymy or in some words, for instance in the [[Gallurese dialect]] spoken in Sardinia ''zerru'' 'pig'. A similar situation is valid for [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. The occupation of the island by the [[Vandals]] around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers (see [[Medieval Corsica]]). If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire. It has been theorised that a [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] variety might have been spoken in Corsica, prior to the island's [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscanisation]] under [[Pisa]]n and [[Genoa|Genoese]] rule.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sardinian-language ''Sardinian language'', Encyclopedia Britannica]</ref>\n\n== Dialects ==\n===Corsica===\nThe two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are the groups spoken in the [[Bastia]] and [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as [[Haute-Corse]], ''Cismonte'' or ''Corsica suprana''), and the groups spoken around [[Sart\u00e8ne]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]] (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as [[Corse-du-Sud]], ''Pumonti'' or ''Corsica suttana''). The dialect of [[Ajaccio]] has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] and [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] are closer to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] dialect, also known as [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]].\n\nThis division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern Corsican dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern Corsican varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and, only to some extent, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].\n\n====Northern Corsican====\nThe Northern Corsican macro variety (''Supranacciu'', ''Supranu'', ''Cismuntincu'' or ''Cismontano'') is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West Corsica around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialect of Bastia and [[Cap Corse]] might be included among the Tuscan dialects, being they the closest form to standard Italian than any other Italo-Dalmatian dialects, with the exception of [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]]. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Remote Past Tense of ''av\u00e8'' (e.g. ''ella amarebbe'' \"she would love\") are generally considered ''Cismontani'' dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of [[Piana]], [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]], [[Vizzavona]], [[Ghisoni]] and [[Ghisonaccia]], and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses ''lu'', ''li'', ''la'', ''le'' as definite articles), Bastia (besides i>e and a>e, u>o: ''ottanta'', ''momentu'', ''tocc\u00e0'', ''continentale''; a>o: ''oliva'', ''orechja'', ''ocellu''), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general Corsican traits: ''distinu'', ''ghjinnaghju'', ''sicondu'', ''billezza'', ''apartu'', ''farru'', ''marcuri'', ''cantaraghju'', ''uttanta'', ''mumentu'', ''tucc\u00e0'', ''cuntinentale'', ''aliva'', ''arechja'', ''acellu'').\n\n====Transitional Area====\nAcross the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated to either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line, are the dialects around [[Piana]] and [[Calcatoggio]], from Cinarca with [[Vizzavona]] (which form the conditional tense like in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which present the retroflex sound ''\u0256''; along the Southern line, one can spot the dialects of Ajaccio (having the cacuminal sound ''\u0256'' evolving from the ''ll'' nexus, the pronunciation of -''ghj''-, the feminine plurals ending in ''i'', some Northern words like ''cane'' and ''accatt\u00e0'' instead of ''ghjacaru'' and ''cumpr\u00e0'', as well as ''ellu''/''ella'' and not ''eddu''/''edda''; minor variations: ''sabbatu''>''sabbitu'', ''u li d\u00e0''>''ghi lu d\u00e0''; final syllable often stressed and truncated: ''marinari''>''marin\u00e0'', ''panatteri''>''panatt\u00e8'', ''castellu''>''cast\u00e8'', ''cuchjari''>''cuchj\u00e0''), the [[Gravona]] area, [[Bastelica]] (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: ''Basterga'') and Solenzara, which did not preserve the short Latin vowels: ''seccu'', ''peru'', ''rossu'', ''croci'', ''pozzu'').\n\n====Southern Corsican====\nThe Southern Corsican macro variety (''Suttanacciu'', ''Suttanu'', ''Pumontincu'' or ''Oltramontano'') is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sart\u00e8ne and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, such group retains the distinction of the short Latin vowels ''\u012d'' e ''\u016d'' (e.g. ''pilu'', ''bucca''). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the [[voiced retroflex stop]], like Sicilian (e.g. ''aceddu'', ''beddu'', ''quiddu'', ''ziteddu'', ''famidda''), and the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Imperfect Tense of ''av\u00e8'' (e.g. ''idda amar\u00eca'' \"she would love\"). All the ''Oltramontani'' dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, [[Bastelica]], Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around [[Taravo]] (cacuminal -''dd''- only for the -''ll'' nexus: ''frateddu'', ''suredda'', ''beddu''; but preservation of the [[palatal lateral approximant]]: ''pigli\u00e0'', ''famiglia'', ''figliolu'', ''vogliu''; it does not preserve the short Latin vowels: ''seccu'', ''peru'', ''rossu'', ''croci'', ''pozzu''), Sart\u00e8ne (preserving the short Latin vowels: ''siccu'', ''piru'', ''russu'', ''cruci'', ''puzzu''; changing the ''rn'' nexus to ''rr'': ''forru'', ''carri'', ''corru''; presenting the voiced retroflex stop in place of the palatal lateral approximant: ''pidd\u00e0'', ''famidda'', ''fiddolu'', ''voddu''; imperfect tense like ''cant\u00e0vami'', ''cant\u00e0vani''; masculing plurals ending in ''a'': ''l'ochja'', ''i poma''; having ''eddu/edda/eddi'' as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in Corsica, being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio's hinterlands (masculin singulars always ending in ''u'': ''fiumu'', ''paesu'', ''patronu''; masculin plurals always ending in ''a'': ''i letta'', ''i solda'', ''i ponta'', ''i foca'', ''i mura'', ''i loca'', ''i balcona''; imperfect tense like ''cant\u00e0iami'', ''cant\u00e0iani'').\n\n[[Image:Gallurese.png|right|thumb|250px|Languages in northern [[Sardinia]]]]\n\n===Sardinia===\n{{Main|Gallurese dialect|Sassarese language}}\nThe Gallurese variety is spoken in the extreme north of [[Sardinia]], including the region of [[Gallura]] and the archipelago of [[La Maddalena]], and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] is spoken in [[Sassari]] and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of [[Sardinia]]. Whether the two should be included either in Corsican or in Sardinian as dialects or considered independent languages is still subject of debate.\n\nOn [[Maddalena archipelago]] the local dialect (called ''Isulanu, Maddaleninu, Maddalenino'') was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio during immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Corsican.

The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs ''chj'', ''ghj'', ''sc'' and ''sg'' are also defined as \"letters\" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of ''ch'' or ''ll'' in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after ''c'', ''g'' and ''s''.\n\nThe primary diacritic used is the [[grave accent]], indicating word stress when it is not [[penult]]imate. In scholarly contexts, [[syllable|disyllables]] may be distinguished from [[diphthong]]s by use of the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the [[acute accent]] is sometimes found on stressed {{angle bracket|e}}, the [[circumflex]] on stressed {{angle bracket|o}}, indicating respectively ({{IPA|/e/}}) and ({{IPA|/o/}}) phonemes.\n\nCorsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -''u'' for final -''o'' and the articles ''u'' and ''a'' for ''il/lo'' and ''la'' respectively; however, both the dialect of [[Cap Corse]] and Gallurese retain the original articles ''lu'' and ''la''). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern Corsican dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Vowels ===\nAs in Italian, the grapheme {{angle bracket|i}} appears in some [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]] in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. {{angle bracket|i}} is not pronounced between {{angle bracket|sc/sg/c/g}} and {{angle bracket|a/o/u}}: ''sciarpa'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283arpa]}}; or initially in some words: ''istu'' {{IPA|[\u02c8stu]}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=La prononciation des voyelles|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>\n\nVowels may be nasalized before {{angle bracket|n}} (which is assimilated to {{angle bracket|m}} before {{angle bracket|p}} or {{angle bracket|b}}) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by {{angle bracket|gn}}. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|m}} or {{angle bracket|gn}}. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference.

For a few years he had been living in New York, driving a taxicab, and running a small business repairing typewriters, when he managed to sign a deal with a Czechoslovakian company to manufacture their designs in Canada. He moved to Toronto to start production. By the late 1950s a wave of Japanese machines forced most North American typewriter companies to cease business, but Tramiel instead turned to [[adding machine]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2936643/commodore-founder-jack-tramiel-dies|title=Commodore founder Jack Tramiel dies |work= The verge |date=9 April 2012|access-date= December 8, 2017 |last=Sottek |first=T.C.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the company was formally incorporated as Commodore Business Machines, Inc. (CBM) in Canada. In 1962 Commodore went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), under the name of Commodore International Limited. In the late 1960s, history repeated itself when Japanese firms started producing and exporting adding machines. The company's main investor and chairman, [[Irving Gould]], suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to understand how to compete. Instead, Tramiel returned with the new idea to produce electronic [[calculator]]s, which were just coming on the market.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nCommodore soon had a profitable calculator line and was one of the more popular brands in the early 1970s, producing both consumer as well as scientific/programmable calculators. However, in 1975, [[Texas Instruments]], the main supplier of calculator parts, entered the market directly and put out a line of machines priced at less than Commodore's cost for the parts.

TI responded by cutting prices on its [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]], which had been introduced in 1981.

It did so by buying a small startup company called [[Amiga Corporation]] in February 1983, for $25 million ($12.8 million in cash and 550,000 in common shares) which became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc.<ref>David Needle. \"Special Report\" p.90 Personal Computing, (August 1985)</ref> Commodore brought this new [[32-bit]] computer design (initially codenamed \"Lorraine\") from 1979, and had been called High-Toro from 1980 to 1981 then later dubbed the Amiga, under Amiga Inc. in early 1982. There were three unsuccessful attempts to release the Amiga by Jay Miner and company.  These were: 1982, 1983 and one more after Commodore bought Amiga in 1984, after which it was released only to the local public. Then in 1985 Commodore re-released it to the world. Cost was $1000-$1300.\n\nBut Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. His design was 95% completed by June (which fueled speculation that his engineers had taken technology with them from Commodore).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] which allowed him to strike back and release the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800. The Atari ST was technology-wise almost out, however the Amiga was out sooner.\n\nDuring development in 1981, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and was desperate for more financing. [[Jay Miner]] and company had approached former employer [[Atari]], and the Warner-owned Atari had paid Amiga to continue development work.<ref>{{cite web|title=TOP SECRET: Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723091215/http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-23 |date=November 1981 |work=Atari Historical Society |accessdate=2006-07-23 }}</ref> In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design as a video game console.

Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several on-again/off-again talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July.\n\nAs more execs and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join up with Tramiel's new company [[Atari Corp.]], Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.\n\nOne of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff, and to cancel almost all ongoing projects, in order to review their continued viability. In late July/early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the contract to counter-sue Commodore through its new subsidiary, Amiga, on August 13.\n\nThe Amiga crew, still suffering serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore's intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. This \"interpretation\" is what Tramiel used to counter-sue, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing any resembling technology. This was an attempt to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless. The resulting court case lasted for several years, with both companies releasing their respective products. In the end, the Amiga computer outlasted the Atari.<ref name=\"Jay Miner\">Jay Miner</ref>\n\n[[File:Amiga500 system1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|Amiga 500 (1987)]]\n\nThroughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame war#Holy wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior.

Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of [[flotilla admiral]] or [[counter admiral]] or [[senior captain]] as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral.\n\nTraditionally, \"commodore\" is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time, even temporarily, much as \"captain\" is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer's official title in the service is a lower rank. As an official rank, a commodore typically commands a [[flotilla]] or [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] of ships as part of a larger [[task force]] or [[naval fleet]] commanded by an [[admiral]].  A commodore's ship is typically designated by the flying of a [[Broad pennant]], as opposed to an admiral's flag. \n\nIt is often regarded as a [[one-star rank]] with a [[NATO]] code of [[OF-6]] (which is known in the U.S. as \"[[rear admiral]] (lower half)\"), but whether it is regarded as a [[flag rank]] varies between countries.<ref>Whether \"commodore\" is a [[flag rank]] (or not) varies by country. Often, \"rear admiral\" is the first of the \"flag ranks\". For example, it was not until 2001 that the UK made \"commodore\" a \"flag rank\", and changed the shoulder rank insignia (although not the cuff rings) of the higher ranking admirals accordingly. Australia made this change in the mid-1990s, and also changed the commodore rank insignia to include a star.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes abbreviated: as \"Cdre\" in British Royal Navy, \"CDRE\" in the US Navy, \"Cmdre\" in the Royal Canadian Navy, \"COMO\" in the Spanish Navy and in some navies speaking the Spanish language, or \"CMDE\" as used in the Indian Navy or in some other Navies.<ref>The \"Cdre\" abbreviation for the OF-6 rank of commodore is sometimes confused with the \"Cmdr\" abbreviation for the OF-4 rank of \"[[commander]]\".</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe rank of commodore derives from the [[French language|French]] ''commandeur'', which was one of the highest ranks in the [[orders of knighthood]], and in [[Military order (monastic society)|military orders]] the title of the knight in charge of a ''commande'' (a local part of the order's territorial possessions).\n\n==History==\nThe [[Dutch Navy]] also used the rank of ''[[commandeur]]'' from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] has adopted the English spelling of ''commodore'' for an equivalent rank.\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]], [[commodore (Royal Navy)|the position]] was introduced in the 17th Century to combat the cost of appointing more admirals\u2014a costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navy's at that time.\n\nThe rank of commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon captains who commanded [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of commodore was merely viewed as a [[senior captain]] position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of commodore the prestige of [[flag officer]] status.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|Commodore (United States)}}\nIn 1899, the substantive rank of commodore was discontinued in the [[United States Navy]], but revived during World War II in both the U.S. Navy and [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title \"commodore\" was then used to identify senior [[captain (U.S. Navy)|U.S. Navy captains]] who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or carrier air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s, [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Coast Guard]] captains selected for promotion to the rank of [[rear admiral]] (lower half), would wear the same insignia as rear admiral (upper half), i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one-star officers and paid at the one-star rate.\n\nTo correct this inequity, the rank of commodore as a single star flag officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on, who held the temporary \"title\" of commodore while in their major command billet. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one-star rank as [[commodore admiral]] (CADM) within the first six months following the rank's reintroduction. However, this was considered an awkward title and the one-star flag rank was renamed a few months later to its current title of rear admiral (lower half), later abbreviated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard as RDML.\n\nThe \"title\" of commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for those senior captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]]; air wings or air groups of multiple [[Squadron (aviation)|aviation squadrons]] other than carrier air wings (the latter whose commanders still use the title \"CAG\"); explosive ordnance disposal ([[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]]), mine warfare and special warfare ([[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]]) groups; and construction battalion ([[SeaBee]]) regiments. Although not flag officers, modern day commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant, also known as a [[broad pennant]], that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships that they are embarked aboard when they are the senior officer present afloat (SOPA).\n\n===Argentina===\nIn the Argentine Navy, the position of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually, but not always, issued to senior captains holding rear-admirals' positions. It is not a rank but a distinction and, as such, can be issued by the chief of staff without congressional approval. Its equivalents are colonel-major in the Army and commodore-major in the Air Force. It is usually\u2014but incorrectly\u2014referred to as \"navy commodore\", to avoid confusion with the \"air force commodore\", which is equivalent to the navy's captain and army's colonel. The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the epaulette.\n\n==Naval rank==\nThe following articles deal with the rank of commodore (or its equivalent) as it is employed [[OF-6]] [[one-star rank|one-star]] flag officer rank in various countries.\n{| class=wikitable\n!Country !!

This rank is the equivalent of a [[colonel]] in the [[Argentine Army]], and a colonel or [[group captain]] in other air forces of the world. The Argentine rank below commodore is the rank of vice-commodore (Spanish ''vicecomodoro'') equivalent to a [[lieutenant-colonel]] in the Argentine Army, and a lieutenant-colonel or [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in other air forces.\n\nCommodore is a rank in the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. It is a [[one-star rank]] and has essentially the same rank insignia as the British [[air commodore]].\n\nMany air forces use the rank of [[air commodore]]. This rank was first used by the [[Royal Air Force]] and is now used in many countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Greece, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. It is the equivalent rank to the navy rank of \"commodore\", and the army ranks of [[brigadier]] and [[brigadier general]].\n\nThe German air force used the concept of a unit commodore for the commander of a wing, usually in the rank of colonel (OF-5).\n\n==Merchant Service (Merchant Marine) rank and Yacht Club chief directors==\n<!-- An internal link from [[RMS Titanic]] is targeted to this section. Please change the link on that page if you change the section name here! Thanks. -->\nCommodore is also a title held by many captains as recognition of exceptional navigation ability and seagoing seniority in the Merchant Service, and by the directors of a few yacht clubs and boating associations. Commodores 'in command' as Master aboard Merchant Marine ships wear distinctive rank and cap insignia denoting their honorific high rank position.\n\n==Convoy commodore==\n\nDuring wartime, a shipping [[convoy]] will have a ranking officer\u2014sometimes an active-duty naval [[commissioned officer|officer]], at other times a [[civilian]] [[Master Mariner|master]] or retired naval officer\u2014designated as the ''convoy commodore''. This title is not related to the individual{{'}}s military rank (if any), but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the [[merchant ship]]s and naval [[auxiliary ship]]s that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy{{'}} escort forces (if any), which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.\n\n==Other uses==\n\nThe [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]] also employs variants of the ''title'' of commodore.  Members of the Auxiliary are civilian volunteers who do not have military rank, but who do wear modified U.S. Coast Guard uniforms and U.S. military-style officer rank insignia to indicate office.  Auxiliary members who have been elected or appointed to positions in the highest levels of the organization, similar in nature to active and reserve rear admirals and vice admirals use the term commodore (e.g., District Commodore, Assistant National Commodore, Deputy National Commodore, National Commodore, etc.).  These Coast Guard Auxiliarists may permanently append the title commodore, sometimes abbreviated COMO, to their names (e.g., Commodore James A.
