He was born around 735 and became the student of [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Archbishop Ecgbert]] at York. At the invitation of [[Charlemagne]], he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian court]], where he remained a figure in the 780s and '90s.\n\nAlcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was made Abbot of [[Tours]] in 796, where he remained until his death. \"The most learned man anywhere to be found\", according to [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni|Life of Charlemagne]]''<ref>Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', \u00a725.</ref> (''ca.'' 817-833), he is considered among the most important architects of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:AT 13763 Roof figures at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna-8.jpg|thumb|upright|Alcuin, roof figure, Museum of History of Arts, Vienna.]]\nAlcuin was born in [[Northumbria]], presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.<ref name=\"Bullough, Alcuin, p. 164\">Bullough 2003, p. 164.</ref> In common hagiographical fashion, the ''Vita Alcuini'' asserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,' and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint [[Willibrord]]; and Beornred, abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens, who was more distantly related.<ref name=\"Bullough 2003, pp. 146\u20137, 165\">Bullough 2003, pp. 146\u20137, 165.</ref>\n\nIn his ''Life'' of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a ''paterfamilias'', had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [[Humber]], which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing ''paterfamilias'' (\"head of a family, householder\") usually referred to a [[churl|ceorl]], [[Donald A. Bullough]] suggests that Alcuin's family was of [[churl|cierlisc]] status: ''i.e.,'' free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.<ref name=\"Bullough 2003, pp. 146\u20137, 165\"/> If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [[Deira]].<ref>Bullough 2003, p. 165.</ref>\n\n===York===\nThe young Alcuin came to the [[cathedral church]] of [[York]] during the golden age of Archbishop [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgbert]] and his brother, the Northumbrian King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.\n\nThe York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.<ref name=RenewAmerica>{{cite web|title=A cure for the educational crisis: Learn from the extraordinary educational heritage of the West |work=RenewAmerica analyst |url=http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |accessdate=2 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602171225/http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |archivedate=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines,<ref name=Burns>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01276a.htm Burns, James. \"Alcuin.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 29 Nov. 2014]</ref> writing a [[codex]] on the trivium, while his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium.\n\nAlcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.\n\nIn 781, King [[\u00c6lfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=Alcuin, Charlemagne, and the problem of sanctions|first=Henry|last=Mayr-Harting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VwK6qHH81oC&pg=PA207|pages=207\u2013218|title=Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald|series=Studies in Early Medieval Britain|editor-first=Stephen David|editor-last=Baxter|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=9780754663317}}.

He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], Rado, and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write that \"the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles.\"\n\nAlcuin became Master of the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] (''Urbs Regale'') in 782.<ref name=Burns/> It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]] and, most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.\n\nIn this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, \"Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.\" His arguments seem to have prevailed \u2013 Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.<ref>Needham, Dr. N.R., ''Two Thousand Years of Christ's Power, Part Two: The Middle Ages'', Grace Publications, 2000, page 52.</ref>\n\nCharlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.<ref name=wilmot>{{cite book|last=Wilmot-Buxton|first=E.M.|title=Alcuin|year=1922|publisher=P.J. Kenedy & Sons|location=New York|page=93|url=https://archive.org/stream/alcuin__00wilm#page/92/mode/2up}}</ref> Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils \u2013 derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.<ref>Stephen Jaegar, ''Enobling love: in search of a lost sensibility'' (University of Pennsylvania, 1999)</ref> According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', \"He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king\u2019s esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.<ref name=EB/>\n\n===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia===\nIn 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]], an [[heresiarch]] according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.<ref name=Burns/> Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[\u00c6thelred I of Northumbria|\u00c6thelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.\n\nHe was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to \u00c6thelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and to [[\u00c6thelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, dealing with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, ''De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii'', provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: \"''Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments''.\"\n\n===Tours and death===\nIn 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful [[Carolingian minuscule]] script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.<ref name=EB>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcuin \"Alcuin\", ''Ecyclopedia Britannica'']</ref>\n\nAlcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:\n{{quote|Dust, worms, and ashes now&nbsp;...<br /> Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,<br /> Pray, reader, for my soul.}}\n\nThe majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. There are also autobiographical sections in Alcuin's poem on York and in the ''Vita Alcuini'', a ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' written for him at Ferri\u00e8res in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.\n\n==Carolingian Renaissance figure and legacy==\n\n===Mathematician===\n{{Main|Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes}}\nThe collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled ''Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes'' (\"Problems to Sharpen Youths\")<ref name=\"propositiones\">[http://www.intratext.com/X/LAT0602.HTM The first few problems of Alcuin's on original Latin] (English: ''Problems to sharpen the young'',  proper title ''Propositiones Alcuini Doctoris Caroli Magni Imperatoris ad Acuendes Juvenes''\u2014''Propositions of Alcuin, A Teacher of Emperor Charlemagne, for Sharpening Youths'')</ref> is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.<ref name=\"Peterson-2005\">[http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_11_21_05.html Ivars Peterson's MathTrek Nov 21, 2005]</ref><ref name=\"Atkinson-2005\">Atkinson, L. 2005.

Tomus II: Alcuinus. Turnhout: Brepols, 1999, 482\u20133.</ref><ref>A more skeptical attitude toward Alcuin's authorship of this text and others is taken by Michael Gorman, \"Alcuin Before Migne,\" ''Revue b\u00e9n\u00e9dictine'' 112 (2002); 101\u2013130.</ref>\nThe text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [[river crossing problem|river crossings]], including the [[Jealous husbands problem|problem of three anxious brothers]], each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled<ref name=\"3-brothers\">[http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/alcuin.pdf Latin title and English text of the problem]</ref> (Problem 17); the [[Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle|problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage]] (Problem 18); and the problem of \"the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults\" (Problem 19). [[Alcuin's sequence]] is the solution to one of the problems of that book.\n\n===Literary influence===\nAlcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the [[Carolingian minuscule]] based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to [[Charlemagne]]. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.\n\nAlcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans|Theodulf, the Visigoth]] is preponderant.\n\nAlcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work \u2013 a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. These are written in the form of [[dialogues]], and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', and commentaries on the Bible.<ref name=Page>[https://archive.org/stream/lettersofalcuin00pageuoft#page/14/mode/2up Page, Rolph Barlow. ''The Letters of Alcuin'', p.15, New York 1909]</ref> Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [[question mark]], though it didn't resemble the modern symbol.<ref>Lynne Truss. ''Eats, Shoots & Leaves'', 2003. p. 76. {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.</ref>\n\nAlcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''.\n\n=== Use of homo-erotic language in writings ===\nAccording to David Clark, passages in some of Alcuin's writings display homosocial desire, even possibly homoerotic imagery. However, Clark says it is not possible to determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings.<ref name= \"ReferenceA\">David Clark, ''Between Medieval Men: Male Friendship and desire in early medieval english''</ref> Historian [[John Boswell]]<ref>John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'', p. 254.</ref><ref name= \"ReferenceB\">{{Citation | first = David | last = Bromell | title = Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History | place = London | year = 2000 | publisher = Wotherspoon and Aldrich}}.</ref> cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized [[homosexual]] feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times \"comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires\", and this reflects the erotic subculture of the [[Carolingian]] monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where \"erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated\u201d.<ref>Lynda L Coon, ''Dark bodies: gender and monastic practice in the early medieval west'' (University of Pennsylvania, 2011)</ref>\n\nErotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently \"eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends\u201d. Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though David Bromell is of the opinion that Alcuin's relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAlcuin was a close friend of Charlemagne's sister [[Gisela, Abbess of Chelles]], whom he \"hailed as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5kABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Gisela,+Abbess+of+Chelles&source=bl&ots=ugSmeY784T&sig=cxjv-k5bRWPfhYf5XI1AwzW_YPE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv0YbHjIbbAhUSON8KHavrBRU4FBDoAQhCMAc#v=onepage&q=Gisela%2C%20Abbess%20of%20Chelles&f=false Dales, Douglas. ''Alcuin: His Life and Legacy'', James Clarke & Co, 2012, {{ISBN|9780227173466}} p. 90]</ref> He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrudis and Bertha that \"the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me.\"{{sfn|Dales, p. 91}} His nickname for Gisela was ''Julia'', for Rotrudis ''Columba''. He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.{{sfn| Dales, p. 91}}\n\nThe interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]],<ref>Allen J. Frantzen, ''Before the Closet'', University of Chicago, 2000</ref><ref>But also Stephen Jaegar, \"L'amour des rois\", ''Annales 46'' (1991)</ref> who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by [[Theodulf of Orleans]]. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia at the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.<ref>Liersch, Karl: [http://www.mgh.de/bibliothek/opac/?wa72ci_url=/cgi-bin/mgh/regsrchindex.pl?wert%3Dgedichte+theodulfs,+bischofs+von+orleans&recnums=195542&index=1&db=opac Die Gedichte Theodulfs, Bischofs von Orleans], Halle, 1880, p. 49-50</ref>\n\nDouglas Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say \"the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship - 'an ordained affection'.\"<ref>Dales, Douglas, and Williams, Rowan. \"The Poet at Work\", ''Alcuin: Theology and Thought'', James Clarke & Co, 2013, {{ISBN|9780227900871}}</ref>\n\nDespite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for \"sinning against nature with men\" \u2014 a view commonly held by the Church at the time. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be \"withered by flames unto eternal barrenness.\"<ref>Alcuin, \"Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin\", J.-P.

He was venerated as a [[pre-Congregation]] [[saint]] and is still honored on the day of his death, 18 February.\n\n==Life==\nAngilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of Charlemagne at the palace school in Aquae Grani ([[Aachen]]). He was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great English scholar Alcuin. When Charlemagne sent his young son [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] to Italy as King of the [[Lombards]] Angilbert went along as ''primicerius palatii,'' a high administrator of the satellite court.{{sfnp|CE|1907}} As the friend and adviser of Pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of Italy. Angilbert delivered the document on [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] from the Frankish Synod of Frankfurt to [[Pope Adrian I]], and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794, and 796.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} At one time, he served an officer of the maritime provinces.{{sfnp|CITD|1998}} He accompanied Charlemagne to Rome in 800{{sfnp|EB|1878}} and was one of the [[Testament of Charlemagne|witnesses to his will in 811]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}}\n\nThere are various traditions concerning Angilbert's relationship with [[Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne]]. One holds that they were married,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} another that they were not.{{sfnp|CITD|1998}} They had, however, at least two sons and one daughter, one of whom, [[Nithard]], became a notable figure in the mid-9th century,{{sfnp|EB|1911}} and the daughter Bertha, went on to marry Helgaud II, count of Ponthieu. Control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the [[Middle Ages]].  Bertha and Angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices. On the other hand, some historians have speculated that Charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands; none of Charlemagne's daughters were married, despite political offers of arranged marriages.\n\nIn 790, he retired to the abbey of Centulum, the \"Monastery of St Richarius\" ({{lang|la|Sancti Richarii monasterium}}) at present-day [[Saint-Riquier]] in [[Picardy]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Elected [[abbot]] in 794,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes.{{sfnp|CE|1907}} It was not uncommon for the [[Merovingian]], [[Carolingian]], or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. Angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding Saint-Riquier; when he completed it, Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there. In keeping with Carolingian policies, Angilbert established a school at Saint-Riquier to educate the local boys.{{sfnp|EBE|2003}}\n\nHis Latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. Charlemagne was referred to as \"David\", a reference to the Biblical king [[David]].{{sfnp|Wilmot-Buxton|1922|p=93}} Angilbert was nicknamed \"[[Homer]]\" because he wrote poetry,{{sfnp|CITD|1998}} and was the probable author of an [[epic poetry|epic]], of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]] and [[Venantius Fortunatus]], composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] (796), an epistle to David (i.e., Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.{{sfnp|EB|1911}}\n\n==Works==\nAngilbert's poems were published by [[Ernst D\u00fcmmler]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. For criticisms of this edition, see [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] in Max Roediger's ''Schriften f\u00fcr germanische Philologie'' (1888).{{sfnp|EB|1911}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|contribution=St. Angilbert |contribution-url=http://www.christdesert.org/cgi-bin/martyrology.dynamic.5.cgi?name=angilbert |title=Martyrology |url=http://www.christdesert.org/public_texts/martyrology/ |publisher=Monastery of Christ in the Desert |date=1998 |location=Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico |ref={{harvid|CITD|1998}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611021417/http://christdesert.org/public_texts/martyrology/ |archivedate=11 June 2015 }}.\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=St Angilbert |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=29 }}\n* {{citation |last=Frassetto |first=Michael |contribution=St. Angilbert (c.&nbsp;740\u2013814) |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA32 |title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2003 |isbn=978-1576072639 |ref={{harvid|EBE|2003}} |page=32 }}\n* {{cite CE1913 |mode=cs2 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |wstitle=St. Angilbert |ref={{harvid|CE|1907}} }}.\n* {{citation |last=Wilmot-Buxton |first=E.M. |title=Alcuin |date=1922 |publisher=P.J.

[[Inorganic compound|Inorganic]] derivatives of [[ammonia]] are also called amines, such as [[chloramine]] (NClH<sub>2</sub>); see [[:Category:Inorganic amines]].<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nThe substituent -NH<sub>2</sub> is called an amino group.<ref name=OChemSmith3E>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Janice Gorzynski\n<!--\n|editor1-last=Hodge |editor1-first=Tami |editor2-last=Nemmers |editor2-first=Donna |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Jayne\n-->\n|title=Organic chemistry |date=2011 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-07-337562-5 |pages=949-993 |edition=3rd |url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/007340277x/student_view0/index.html |language=en |format=Book |chapter=Chapter 25 Amines}}</ref>\n\nCompounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a [[carbonyl]] group, thus having the structure R\u2013CO\u2013NR\u2032R\u2033,<!-- has a well-known carbonyl group to be written as C(=O)? --> are called [[amide]]s and have different chemical properties from amines.\n\n==Classification of amines==\nAmines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen.  '''Aliphatic amines''' contain only H and alkyl substituents. '''[[Aromatic amine]]s''' have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] ring.\n\n<!-- [[primary amine]] redirects to this section -->\nAmines, alkyl and aryl alike, are organized into three subcategories [[#amino_group_connectivity_table|<small>(see table)</small>]] based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen:<ref name=OChemSmith3E />\n\n*'''Primary (1\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an [[alkyl]] or [[aromatic]] group. Important primary alkyl amines include, [[methylamine]], most [[amino acid]]s,  and the [[buffering agent]] [[tris]], while primary aromatic amines include [[aniline]].\n*'''Secondary (2\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Secondary amines have two organic substituents (alkyl, aryl or both) bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include [[dimethylamine]], while an example of an aromatic amine would be [[diphenylamine]].\n*'''Tertiary (3\u00b0) amines'''\u2014In tertiary amines, nitrogen has three organic substituents. Examples include [[trimethylamine]], which has a distinctively fishy smell, and [[EDTA]].\n\nA fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen:\n*'''Cyclic amines'''\u2014[[Cyclic compound|Cyclic]] amines are either secondary or tertiary amines. Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-membered ring [[aziridine]] and the six-membered ring [[piperidine]]. ''N''-methylpiperidine and ''N''-phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines.\n\nIt is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s and have a charged nitrogen center.  Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nAmines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix \"amino-\" or the suffix: \"-amine\". The prefix \"''N''-\" shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.\n\nSystematic names for some common amines:\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"\n| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.<br>\n[[File:Methylamine.svg|100px]]<br>\n'''methylamine'''\n| Higher amines have the prefix ''amino'' as a functional group. IUPAC however does not recommend this convention,{{fact|date=July 2017}} but prefers the alkanamine form, e.g. pentan-2-amine. <br>\n[[File:2-amino-pentane.png|150px]]<br>\n'''2-aminopentane'''<br>(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentan-2-amine'')\n|}\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines. For example, [[Methylamine|methyl]] and [[Ethylamine|ethyl]] amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding [[Methanol|methyl]] and [[Ethanol|ethyl]] alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive \"fishy\" smell.\n\nThe nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H<sup>+</sup> to form an [[ammonium ion]] R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is enhanced by [[hydrogen bonding]] involving these lone electron pairs.  Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium ({{chem|RNH|3|+}}) > secondary ammonium ({{chem|R|2|NH|2|+}}) > tertiary ammonium (R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many [[solvent]]s, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]], have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.\n\n===Spectroscopic identification===\nTypically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques, including mass spectrometry as well as NMR and IR spectroscopies.  <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with D<sub>2</sub>O.  In their [[infrared spectrum]] [[Amine#Connectivity|primary amines]] exhibit two N-H bands, whereas [[Amine#Connectivity|secondary amines]] exhibit only one.<ref name=OChemSmith3E /> \n\n==Structure==\n===Alkyl amines===\nAlkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers.  C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109\u00b0.  C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances.  The energy barrier for the [[nitrogen inversion]] of the stereocenter is about 7&nbsp;[[kcal/mol]] for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.\n\nAmines of the type NHRR\u2032 and NRR\u2032R\u2033 are [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR\u2032 cannot be obtained in optical purity.  For chiral tertiary amines, NRR\u2032R\u2033 can only be resolved when the R, R\u2032, and R\u2033 groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as N-substituted [[aziridine]]s ([[quaternary ammonium salt]]s are resolvable).\n{|  style=\"width:272px; float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:1ex;\"\n |[[File:Amine R-N.svg|76px]]\n | style=\"font-size:200%\" |&nbsp;\u21cc&nbsp;\n |[[File:Amine N-R.svg|76px]]\n |-\n | colspan=3 style=\"font-size:small\" |Inversion of an amine. The pair of dots represents the lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom.\n|}\n\n===Aromatic amines===\nIn aromatic amines (\"anilines\"), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent.  The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter.  In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.<ref>G. M.

Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity.  Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amine group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.\n\n===Solvation effects===\nSolvation significantly affects the basicity of amines.  N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 10<sup>11</sup> by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase.  In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents.  Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic.  The order of pK<sub>b</sub>'s (basicities in water) does not follow this order.  Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\nIn aprotic polar solvents such as [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], and [[acetonitrile]]  the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol.  For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects.\n\n== Synthesis ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===Alkylation===\nThe most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by [[alkylation]] with alcohols:<ref name=Ullmann/>\n:ROH + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 RNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nUnlike the reaction of amines with alkyl halides, the industrial method is [[green chemistry|green]] insofar that the coproduct is water.

Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the \u2013CN group. LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly, LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduces [[amide]]s to amines. Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via [[reductive amination]], which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.\n\n[[Aniline]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas, in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.\n\n===Specialized methods===\nMany laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:white; float:center; margin:0 1em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Reaction name !!

The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. \n \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]].\n\n==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==\nAt temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]].  In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form perfect [[crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0:\n:<math> \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0 </math>\n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.\n\n<blockquote>The [[Third Law of Thermodynamics|Nernst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189\u2013190)</blockquote>\n\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\n\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do simply get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\n\nUsing the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.\n\nSince the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is\n\n:<math> \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,</math>\n\nthus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough.\n\nMoreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187)\n\nOne model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermions]], must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The [[Fermi temperature]] is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.\n\n==Relation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate==\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensate}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.<ref name=\"sib2115\"/>\n\n==Negative temperatures==\n{{Main|Negative temperature}}\n\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar [[Celsius]] or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref>\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name=\"Chase\"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero.]]\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

But all of them seemed to agree that, \"There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Robert|title=New Experiments and Observations touching Cold|year=1665}}</ref>\n\n===Limit to the \"degree of cold\"===\nThe question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the [[gas thermometer|air-thermometer]]. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the volume, or \"spring\" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling-point of water at +73 and the melting-point of ice at +{{frac|51|1|2}}, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale.<ref name=AS2016>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold}}</ref>\n\nThis close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name=\"sib2115\"/> for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that {{convert|-270|C|F K}} might be regarded as absolute cold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}</ref>\n\nValues of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing-point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. [[John Dalton]] in his ''Chemical Philosophy'' gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted \u22123000&nbsp;\u00b0C as the natural zero of temperature.\n\n===Lord Kelvin's work===\nAfter [[James Prescott Joule]] had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Carnot's]] theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by [[Henri Victor Regnault]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|authorlink1=Lord Kelvin|title=On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations.|journal=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|date=1848|volume=1|pages=66\u201371|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/87114#page/72/mode/2up}}</ref> It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at \u2212273&nbsp;\u00b0C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer.<ref name=\"AS2016\"/> This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from {{convert|-271.1|C|F}} to  {{convert|-274.5|C|F}}, derived from laboratory measurements and observations of [[Atmospheric refraction#Astronomical refraction|astronomical refraction]], remained in use in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | last = Newcomb | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Newcomb | date = 1906 | title = A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy | publisher = The Macmillan Company | place = New York | page = 175 | oclc = 64423127}}</ref>\n\n===The race to absolute zero===\n{{see also|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n[[File:Leiden116.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque in Leiden]]\nWith a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab.<ref name=\"MyUser_YouTube_November_23_2016c\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTFRgosx4aQ&t=894s |title=ABSOLUTE ZERO - PBS NOVA DOCUMENTARY (full length) |newspaper=YouTube |date=  |author= |accessdate= November 23, 2016}}</ref> By 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching {{convert|-130|C|F K}}.

In 1877, [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] in France and [[Raoul Pictet]] in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of [[liquid air]] {{convert|-195|C|F K}}.

However Onnes, his rival, was the first to liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the [[Hampson\u2013Linde cycle]].

(1970), p. 48: \"mass is an adiabatically inhibited variable.\"</ref> The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption. For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings. Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic. The same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system.\n\nThe assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others  so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible. Such assumptions are idealizations. The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such \"perfect\" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works. According to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], when sound travels in a gas, there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic. For such an adiabatic process, the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] ([[Young's modulus]]) can be expressed as {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''\u03b3P''}}, where {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]] at constant pressure and at constant volume ({{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''C<sub>p</sub>''|''C<sub>v</sub>''}}}} ) and {{math|''P''}} is the pressure of the gas .\n\n=== Various applications of the adiabatic assumption ===\n\nFor a closed system, one may write the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as : {{math|\u0394''U'' {{=}} ''Q'' + ''W''}}, where {{math|\u0394''U''}} denotes the change of the system's internal energy, {{math|''Q''}} the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and {{math|''W''}} the work done on it by its surroundings.\n\n*If the system has rigid walls such that work cannot be transferred in or out ({{math|''W'' {{=}} 0}}), and the walls of the system are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat ({{math|''Q'' > 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.\n*If the system has rigid walls such that pressure\u2013volume work cannot be done, and the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of a viscous fluid within the system ({{math|''W'' > 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.\n*If the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but not rigid ({{math|''W'' \u2260 0}}), and, in a fictive idealized process, energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless, non-viscous pressure\u2013volume work, and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise. Such a process is called an [[isentropic process]] and is said to be \"reversible\". Fictively, if the process is reversed, the energy added as work can be recovered entirely as work done by the system. If the system contains a compressible gas and is reduced in volume, the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced, and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system, but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic ({{math|\u0394''S'' {{=}} 0}}). Should the work be added in such a way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system, then the process is not isentropic, and if there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise, the process is said to be \"irreversible\", and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work.\n*If the walls of a system are not adiabatic, and energy is transferred in as heat, entropy is transferred into the system with the heat. Such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic, having {{math|''Q'' > 0}}, and {{math|\u0394''S'' > 0}} according to the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nNaturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).\n\nThe transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds. In one such kind, there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc.), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by {{math|''P'' d''V''}}). In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.\n\nThe other extreme kind of work is isochoric work ({{math|d''V'' {{=}} 0}}), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system. A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls, without phase change, will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable. Isochoric work is irreversible.<ref>{{cite book|last=M\u00fcnster |first=A. |date=1970 |title=Classical Thermodynamics |translator-first=E. S. |translator-last=Halberstadt |publisher=Wiley\u2013Interscience |location=London |ISBN=0-471-62430-6 |page=45}}</ref> The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process, of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work. Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with {{math|\u0394''S'' > 0}}, as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.\n\n==Adiabatic heating and cooling==\nThe adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas. Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, [[free expansion]] is an [[isothermal]] process for an ideal gas.\n\n'''Adiabatic heating''' occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a [[piston]] compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time.  This finds practical application in [[diesel engines]] which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.\n\nAdiabatic heating occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] when an [[air mass]] descends, for example, in a [[katabatic wind]], [[Foehn wind]], or [[chinook wind]] flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.\n\n'''Adiabatic cooling''' occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] with [[orographic lifting]] and [[lee waves]], and this can form [[Pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or [[lenticular cloud]]s.\n\nAdiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an [[expanding universe]] can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid. (See [[heat death of the universe]].)\n\nRising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as [[kimberlite]]s.<ref name=\"Kavanagh\">{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=J.

Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption. There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.\n\n==Ideal gas (reversible process)==\n{{main article|Reversible adiabatic process}}\n\n[[Image:Adiabatic.svg|thumb|341px|For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the [[internal energy]] of the working substance must decrease]]\nThe mathematical equation for an [[ideal gas]] undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the [[polytropic process]] equation<ref name=\"Bailyn 53\"/> \n: <math> P V^n = \\text{constant}, </math>\nwhere {{math|''P''}} is pressure, {{math|''V''}} is volume, and for this case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''\u03b3''}}, where \n: <math> \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = \\frac{f + 2}{f}, </math>\n{{math|''C<sub>P</sub>''}} being the [[specific heat]] for constant pressure, {{math|''C<sub>V</sub>''}} being the specific heat for constant volume, {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[adiabatic index]], and {{math|''f''}} is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g. carbon dioxide).\n\nFor a monatomic ideal gas, {{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|5|3}}}}, and for a diatomic gas (such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) {{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|7|5}}}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/adiab.html Adiabatic Processes].</ref> Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein]] or [[Fermionic condensate|Fermi gases]].\n\nFor reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that<ref name=\"Bailyn 53\"/>\n\n: <math> P^{1-\\gamma} T^\\gamma = \\text{constant},</math>\n\n: <math> VT^\\frac{f}{2} = \\text{constant},</math>\n\nwhere ''T'' is an absolute temperature. This can also be written as<ref name=\"Bailyn 53\"/>\n\n: <math> TV^{\\gamma - 1} = \\text{constant}.</math>\n\n===Example of adiabatic compression===\nThe compression stroke in a [[gasoline engine]] can be used as an example of adiabatic compression.  The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1&nbsp;L = 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> = 0.001&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom, and so {{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|7|5}}}}); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1&nbsp;L volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1&nbsp;L by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27&nbsp;\u00b0C, or 300&nbsp;K, and a pressure of 1&nbsp;bar = 100&nbsp;kPa, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).\n\n: <math> P_1 V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}_1 = 100\\,000~\\text{Pa} \\times (0.001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75 </math>\n: <math> = 10^5 \\times 6.31 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5} = 6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5},</math>\n\nso our adiabatic constant for this example is about 6.31&nbsp;Pa&thinsp;m<sup>4.2</sup>.\n\nThe gas is now compressed to a 0.1&nbsp;L (0.0001&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls). The adiabatic constant remains the same, but with the resulting pressure unknown\n\n: <math> P_2 V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}_1 = 6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5} = P \\times (0.0001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75, </math>\n\nso solving for ''P<sub>2</sub>'':\n\n: <math> P_2 = \\frac{6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5}}{(0.0001~\\text{m}^3)^\\frac75} = \\frac{6.31~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{21/5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}^{21/5}} = 2.51 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa}, </math>\n\nor 25.1&nbsp;bar. Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.\n\nWe can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, ''PV''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''nRT'' (''n'' is amount of gas in moles and ''R'' the gas constant for that gas). Our initial conditions being 100&nbsp;kPa of pressure, 1&nbsp;L volume, and 300&nbsp;K of temperature, our experimental constant (''nR'') is:\n\n: <math> \\frac{PV}{T}  = \\operatorname{constant}_2 = \\frac{10^5~\\text{Pa} \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}^3}{300~\\text{K}} = 0.333~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{K}^{-1}.</math>\n\nWe know the compressed gas has {{mvar|V}}&nbsp;= 0.1&nbsp;L and {{mvar|P}}&nbsp;= {{val|2.51|e=6|u=Pa}}, so we can solve for temperature:\n\n: <math> T = \\frac{P V}{\\operatorname{constant}_2} = \\frac{2.51 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa} \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{m}^3}{0.333~\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{K}^{-1}} = 753~\\text{K}. </math>\n\nThat is a final temperature of 753&nbsp;K, or 479&nbsp;\u00b0C, or 896&nbsp;\u00b0F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.  This is why a high-compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause [[engine knocking]] when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a [[supercharger]] with an [[intercooler]] to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous.  A [[diesel engine]] operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature, which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel.\n\n===Adiabatic free expansion of a gas===\n{{See also|Free expansion}}\nFor an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.\n\n===Derivation of ''P''\u2013''V'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===\nThe definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, {{math|''\u03b4Q'' {{=}} 0}}. Then, according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]],\n\n:<math> \\text{(1)} \\qquad d U + \\delta W = \\delta Q = 0, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''dU''}} is the change in the internal energy of the system and {{math|''\u03b4W''}} is work done ''by'' the system. Any work ({{math|''\u03b4W''}}) done must be done at the expense of internal energy {{math|''U''}}, since no heat {{math|''\u03b4Q''}} is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure\u2013volume work {{math|''\u03b4W''}} done ''by'' the system is defined as\n\n:<math> \\text{(2)} \\qquad \\delta W = P \\, dV. </math>\n\nHowever, {{math|''P''}} does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with {{math|''V''}}.\n\nIt is desired to know how the values of {{math|''dP''}} and {{math|''dV''}} relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds. For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by\n\n:<math> \\text{(3)} \\qquad U = \\alpha n R T, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b1''}} is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] divided by two, {{math|''R''}} is the [[universal gas constant]] and {{math|''n''}} is the number of moles in the system (a constant).\n\nDifferentiating equation (3) and use of the [[ideal gas law]], {{math|''PV'' {{=}} ''nRT''}}, yields\n\n:<math> \\text{(4)} \\qquad d U = \\alpha n R \\, dT\n                  = \\alpha \\, d (P V)\n                  = \\alpha (P \\, dV + V \\, dP). </math>\n\nEquation (4) is often expressed as {{math|''dU'' {{=}} ''nC<sub>V</sub> dT''}} because {{math|''C<sub>V</sub>'' {{=}} ''\u03b1R''}}.\n\nNow substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain\n\n: <math> -P \\, dV = \\alpha P \\, dV + \\alpha V \\, dP,</math>\n\nfactorize {{math|\u2212''P dV''}}:\n\n: <math> -(\\alpha + 1) P \\, dV = \\alpha V \\, dP,</math>\n\nand divide both sides by {{math|''PV''}}:\n\n: <math> -(\\alpha + 1) \\frac{dV}{V} = \\alpha \\frac{dP}{P}. </math>\n\nAfter integrating the left and right sides from {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} to {{math|''V''}} and from {{math|''P''<sub>0</sub>}} to {{math|''P''}} and changing the sides respectively,\n\n: <math> \\ln \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha + 1}{\\alpha} \\ln \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right). </math>\n\nExponentiate both sides, substitute {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03b1'' + 1|''\u03b1''}}}} with {{math|''\u03b3''}}, the [[heat capacity ratio]]\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right)^{-\\gamma}, </math>\n\nand eliminate the negative sign to obtain\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{V_0}{V} \\right)^\\gamma. </math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n: <math> \\left( \\frac{P}{P_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V}{V_0} \\right)^\\gamma = 1,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math> P_0 V_0^\\gamma = P V^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}. </math>\n\n===Derivation of ''P''\u2013''T'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===\n\nSubstituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain\n\n: <math> P \\left(\\frac{n R T}{P}\\right)^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}, </math>\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n: <math> P^{1-\\gamma} T^\\gamma = \\operatorname{constant}. </math>\n\n===Derivation of discrete formula===\nThe change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to\n\n:<math> \\text{(1)} \\qquad \\Delta U = \\alpha R nT_2 - \\alpha R nT_1 = \\alpha Rn \\Delta T. </math>\n\nAt the same time, the work done by the pressure\u2013volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to\n\n:<math> \\text{(2)} \\qquad W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2}P \\,dV. </math>\n\nSince we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true\n\n:<math> \\text{(3)} \\qquad \\Delta U + W = 0. </math>\n\nBy the previous derivation,\n\n:<math> \\text{(4)} \\qquad P V^\\gamma = \\text{constant} = P_1 V_1^\\gamma. </math>\n\nRearranging (4) gives\n\n:<math> P = P_1 \\left(\\frac{V_1}{V} \\right)^\\gamma. </math>\n\nSubstituting this into (2) gives\n\n:<math> W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_1 \\left(\\frac{V_1}{V} \\right)^\\gamma \\,dV. </math>\n\nIntegrating,\n\n:<math> W = P_1 V_1^\\gamma \\frac{V_2^{1-\\gamma} - V_1^{1-\\gamma}}{1 - \\gamma}. </math>\n\nSubstituting {{math|''\u03b3'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''\u03b1'' + 1|''\u03b1''}}}},\n\n:<math> W = -\\alpha P_1 V_1^\\gamma \\left( V_2^{1-\\gamma} - V_1^{1-\\gamma} \\right). </math>\n\nRearranging,\n\n:<math> W = -\\alpha P_1 V_1 \\left( \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right)^{1-\\gamma} - 1 \\right). </math>\n\nUsing the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),\n\n:<math> W = -\\alpha n R T_1 \\left( \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right)^{1-\\gamma} - 1 \\right). </math>\n\nBy the continuous formula,\n\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^{-\\gamma}, </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}} = \\frac{V_2}{V_1}. </math>\n\nSubstituting into the previous expression for {{math|''W''}},\n\n:<math> W = -\\alpha n R T_1 \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}} - 1 \\right). </math>\n\nSubstituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives\n\n:<math> \\alpha n R (T_2 - T_1) = \\alpha n R T_1 \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}} - 1 \\right). </math>\n\nSimplifying,\n\n:<math> T_2 - T_1 =  T_1 \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}} - 1 \\right), </math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1 =  \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}} - 1, </math>\n\n:<math> T_2 = T_1 \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}. </math>\n\n==Graphing adiabats==\nAn adiabat is a curve of constant [[entropy]] in a diagram. Some properties of adiabats on a ''P''\u2013''V'' diagram are indicated. These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where ''PV'' becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.\n\n# Every adiabat [[asymptotically]] approaches both the ''V'' axis and the ''P'' axis (just like [[isotherms]]).\n# Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.\n# An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).\n# If isotherms are concave towards the north-east direction (45\u00b0), then adiabats are concave towards the east north-east (31\u00b0).\n# If adiabats and isotherms are graphed at regular intervals of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves towards the axes (towards the south-west), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats grow.  The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see [[Nernst's theorem]]).{{clarify|reason=No quantitative formula is identified in that article as Nernst's theorem, only a qualitative \"Impossibility Principle\"|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe following diagram is a ''P''\u2013''V'' diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms:\n\n[[Image:Entropyandtemp.PNG]]\n\nThe isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.\n\nThe adiabats are isentropic.\n\nVolume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{wiktionary|adiabatic}}\nThe term ''adiabatic'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u00e6|d|i|\u0259|\u02c8|b|\u00e6|t|\u026a|k}}) is an anglicization of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term  \u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \"impassable\" (used by [[Xenophon]] of rivers).\nIt is used in the thermodynamic sense by  [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] (1866),<ref name=\"Rankine 1866\">[[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine, W.J.McQ.]] (1866).

It was important in the work of Joule, because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work.\n\nFor a thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not allow [[mass transfer]], energy can pass in and out only as heat or work. Thus a quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs. The first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the system's [[internal energy]]. Then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state. The first limb adds a definite amount of energy and the second removes it. Accordingly, Rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work, rather than as a calorimetric quantity .<ref>{{cite journal|author-link=William John Macquorn Rankine|last=Rankine |first=W. J.

One approach to these problems was to regard heat, measured by calorimetry, as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized as a form of energy, and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized. The view that eventually established itself, and is currently regarded as right, is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom, and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential. In this light, heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a [[State function|state variable]], but, rather, is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies. The adiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view.<ref name=\"Bailyn Ch 3\"/>\n\n==Divergent usages of the word ''adiabatic''==\nThis present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word ''adiabatic'' is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by Rankine. It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be ''adiabatic'', though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.\n\n[[Quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum statistical mechanics]], however, use the word ''adiabatic'' [[Adiabatic theorem#Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes|in a very different sense]], one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense. In quantum theory, the word ''adiabatic'' can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.\n\nOn the one hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done ''adiabatically''. The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible. While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre- and post-compression, eigenstates. Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system. For example, [[Max Born]] writes \"Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly. In this case, to a very high approximation\n\n:<math>c_1^2=1,\\,\\,c_2^2=0,\\,\\,c_3^2=0,\\,...\\,,</math>\n\nthat is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation. Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author-link=Max Born|last=Born |first=M. |date=1927 |title=Physical aspects of quantum mechanics |journal=Nature |volume=119 |pages=354\u2013357|bibcode = 1927Natur.119..354B |doi = 10.1038/119354a0 }} (Translation by Robert Oppenheimer.)</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes. In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be ''adiabatic'', and the contrary word ''[[Adiabatic theorem#Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes|diabatic]]'' is applied to it. One might guess that perhaps Clausius, if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that \"internal work\" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat. The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.\n\nThus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated. But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term. The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adiabatic conductivity]]\n* [[Cyclic process]]\n* [[First law of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Heat burst]]\n* [[Isobaric process]]\n* [[Isenthalpic process]]\n* [[Isentropic process]]\n* [[Isochoric process]]\n* [[Isothermal process]]\n* [[Polytropic process]]\n* [[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Quasistatic process]]\n* [[Total air temperature]]\n* [[Magnetic refrigeration]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;General\n* {{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Silbey |year=2004 |title=Physical chemistry |location=Hoboken |publisher=Wiley |page=55 |isbn=978-0-471-21504-2 |display-authors=etal}}\n* Broholm, Collin. \"Adiabatic free expansion\".

For discussion of these \"[[anionic]] amides\", see [[Metal amides#Alkali metal amides|Alkali metal amides]].\n\nDue to the dual use of the word 'amide', there is debate as to how to properly and unambiguously name the derived ''anions'' of amides in the first sense (i.e., deprotonated acylated amines), a few of which are commonly used as nonreactive counterions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old2015.iupac.org/publications/ci/2007/2904/ud.html|title=Chemistry International -- Newsmagazine for IUPAC|website=old2015.iupac.org|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref> \n\nThe remainder of this article is about the [[carbonyl]]\u2013[[nitrogen]] sense of ''amide''.\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nThe simplest amides are derivatives of [[ammonia]] wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an [[acyl]] group. The ensemble is generally represented as RC(O)NH<sub>2</sub> and is described as a primary amide. Closely related and even more numerous are secondary amides which can be derived from [[primary amine]]s (R\u2032NH<sub>2</sub>) and have the formula RC(O)NHR\u2032. Tertiary amides are commonly derived from [[secondary amine]]s (R\u2032R\u2033NH) and have the general structure RC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033. Amides are usually regarded as derivatives of [[carboxylic acid]]s in which the [[hydroxyl]] group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia.\n:[[Image:AmideResonance.png|300px]]\nThe lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized into the carbonyl, thus forming a partial [[double bond]] between N and the [[carbonyl]] [[carbon]]. Consequently, the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal. It is estimated that acetamide is described by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28% (which does not sum to 100% because there are additional resonance forms that are not depicted in the above Figure). One final thing to note when looking at the bonds of an amide is that there is also a hydrogen bond present between the active groups hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.<ref name = Kemnitz>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0663024|title=\"Amide Resonance\" Correlates with a Breadth of C\u2212N Rotation Barriers|year=2007|last1=Kemnitz|first1=Carl R.|last2=Loewen|first2=Mark J.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=9|pages=2521\u20138|pmid=17295481}}</ref>\n<!--needs:\nbarrier from DMF, and a more general ref than this JACS rpt\ncomment on syn and anti secondary amides-->\n[[Image:Formamide-MO-3D-balls.png|thumb|180px|Amides possess a [[conjugated system]] spread over the O, C and N atoms, consisting of [[molecular orbital]]s occupied by [[delocalized electron]]s. One of the [[pi bond|\u03c0 molecular orbitals]] in [[formamide]] is shown above.]]\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Main article|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Amines and amides}}\nIn the usual nomenclature, one adds the term \"amide\" to the stem of the parent acid's name. For instance, the amide derived from [[acetic acid]] is named [[acetamide]] (CH<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>). IUPAC recommends [[ethanamide]], but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from [[dimethylamine]] and [[acetic acid]] is ''N'',''N''-dimethylacetamide (CH<sub>3</sub>CONMe<sub>2</sub>, where Me = CH<sub>3</sub>). Usually even this name is simplified to [[dimethylacetamide]]. Cyclic amides are called [[lactam]]s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides.IUPAC name of these compounds are Azacycloalkanones. Functional groups consisting of \u2013P(O)NR<sub>2</sub> and \u2013SO<sub>2</sub>NR<sub>2</sub> are [[phosphonamides]] and [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]]s, respectively.<ref>Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-821. Amides http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_540.htm</ref> \n\n===Pronunciation===\nSome chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two, saying {{IPAc-en|\u0259|\u02c8|m|i\u02d0|d}} for the [[carbonyl]]\u2013[[nitrogen]] compound and {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-amide.ogg|\u02c8|e\u026a|m|a\u026a|d}} {{contradict-inline|date=August 2012}} for the [[anion]]. Others replace one of these with {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|m|\u1d7b|d}}, while still others pronounce both {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|m|\u1d7b|d}}, making them [[homonym]]s.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Basicity===\nCompared to [[amine]]s, amides are very weak [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s. While the [[conjugate acid]] of an [[amine]] has a [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] of about 9.5, the [[conjugate acid]] of an amide has a p''K''<sub>a</sub> around \u22120.5. Therefore, amides don't have as clearly noticeable [[acid\u2013base]] properties in [[water]]. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the [[electron]]-withdrawing nature of the [[carbonyl group]] where the lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized by [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. On the other hand, amides are much stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s than [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s (their conjugate acids' p''K''<sub>a</sub>s are between \u22126 and \u221210). It is estimated [[in silico]] that [[acetamide]] is represented by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28%.<ref name = Kemnitz/> Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained [[quinuclidone]].\n\nBecause of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N\u2013C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N\u2013C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N\u2013H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N\u2013H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.\n\nThe proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p''K''<sub>a</sub> is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl [[oxygen]] can become protonated with a p''K''<sub>a</sub> of roughly \u22121.\n\n===Solubility===\nThe [[Solubility|solubilities]] of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of [[Dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]], exhibit low solubility in water.\n\n==Characterization==\nThe presence of the functional group is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. They are the most common non-basic functional group. They can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]]. Amides exhibit a moderately intense ''\u03bd''<sub>CO</sub> band near 1650&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. By <sup>1</sup>H [[NMR spectroscopy]], CON'''H'''R signals occur at low fields. In X-ray crystallography, the C(O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane.\n\n==Applications and occurrence==\nAmides are pervasive in nature and technology as structural materials. The amide linkage is easily formed, confers structural rigidity, and resists [[hydrolysis]]. [[Nylon]]s are [[polyamide]]s, as are the very resilient materials [[Aramid]], [[Twaron]], and [[Kevlar]]. Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of [[protein]]s, the [[secondary structure]] of which is due in part to the [[hydrogen bonding]] abilities of amides. Amide linkages in a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] context are called [[peptide bond]]s when they occur in the main chain of a protein and [[isopeptide bond]]s when they occur to a side-chain of the protein. Proteins can have structural roles, such as in [[hair]] or [[spider silk]], but also nearly all [[enzyme]]s are proteins. Low molecular weight amides, such as [[dimethylformamide]] (HC(O)N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), are common solvents. Many drugs are amides, including [[paracetamol]], [[penicillin]] and [[LSD]]. Moreover, plant ''N''-[[alkylamides]] have a wide range of biological functionalities.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.038|title=Alkamid database: Chemistry, occurrence and functionality of plant ''N''-alkylamides|year=2012|last1=Boonen|first1=Jente|last2=Bronselaer|first2=Antoon|last3=Nielandt|first3=Joachim|last4=Veryser|first4=Lieselotte|last5=De Tr\u00e9|first5=Guy|last6=De Spiegeleer|first6=Bart|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=142|issue=3|pages=563\u201390|pmid=22659196|hdl=1854/LU-2133714|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/2133714/file/2140565.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Amide synthesis==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\nMany methods exist in amide synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Amide bond formation and peptide coupling |first1=Christian A.

In general this reaction is thermodynamically favorable, however it suffers from a high [[activation energy]], largely due to the amine first deprotonating the carboxylic acid, which reduces its reactivity. As such the direct reaction often requires high temperatures.\n\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R\u2032R\u2033NH {{eqm}} {{chem|RCO|2|\u2212}} + {{chem|R\u2032R\u2033NH|2|+}} {{eqm}} RC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033 + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nMany methods are known for driving the equilibrium to the right.

However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to \"primitive\" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of \"savage\" people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />\n\nTylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as \"spiritualism\" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term \"animism\" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67\u2013S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that there had once been \"one universal form of primitive religion\" (whether labelled \"animism\", \"totemism\", or \"shamanism\") has been dismissed as \"unsophisticated\" and \"erroneous\" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that \"it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants\".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}\n\n==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====\nTylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of \"primitive society\" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on \"primitive society\" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The \"19th-century armchair anthropologists\" argued \"primitive society\" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of \"developed\" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented \"survivals\" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The term [\"animism\"] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name=\"Kuper 2005 85\" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]].\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title=\"Animism\" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim.

He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}\n\nIn 2000, Guthrie suggested that the \"most widespread\" concept of animism was that it was the \"attribution of spirits to natural phenomena\nsuch as stones and trees\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}\n\n=== The new animism ===\n\nMany anthropologists ceased using the term \"animism\", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups \u2013 namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers \u2013 who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as \"animists\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the \"old animist\" definition had been problematic, the term \"animism\" was nevertheless \"of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world.\"{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}\n\n[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the \"new animism\".]]\nThe \"new animism\" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to \"act as a person\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}\n\nHallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}\n\nMore recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to \"animate\" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our \"professional subcultures,\" which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are \"approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22\u20134|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}</ref> These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" />\n\nNurit Bird-David argues that \"Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!\"<ref name=\"Bird-David 1999 S68\" /> She argues that animism is a \"relational epistemology\", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the \"individual\"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships (\"dividuals\"), some of which are with \"superpersons\" (i.e. non-humans).\n\nGuthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that \"the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it\". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning \"the scientific project\".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}\n\nTim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: \"Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, \"feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}</ref> The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}</ref> [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.\n\nCultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively \"solicit our attention\" or \"call our focus,\" coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.<ref>Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}</ref>  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us\u2014we 'see what they say'\u2014much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. \"To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=303}}</ref>\n\nThe religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief \"that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore \"concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons\".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}\nGraham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's \"I-thou\" as opposed to \"I-it\". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a \"thou\" rather than as an \"it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Graham|title=The Handbook of Contemporary Animism|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Shaman tableau.png|thumb|A tableau presenting figures of various cultures filling in mediator-like roles, often being termed as \"[[shaman]]\" in the literature]]\n[[File:Autel animiste.

Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.<ref name = Eli72>Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3\u20137.</ref> Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies \u2014 the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|pages=3\u201329}}</ref>\n\n=== Distinction from pantheism ===\nAnimism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.<ref>Paul A.

Lewis ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism'', 2008, pp.&nbsp;408\u2013409</ref>\n\n== Animist life ==\n\n=== Animals, plants, and the elements ===\n\nAnimism entails the belief that \"all living things have a soul\", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=99}} The actions of non-human animals are viewed as \"intentional, planned and purposive\",{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=101}} and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=100}} In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in [[kinship]] systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=102}} Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a [[powwow]] held by the [[Conne River]] [[Mi'kmaq]] in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' (\"eagle\"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nSome animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nVarious animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106\u2013107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nThe importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}\n\n=== Spirits ===\n\nAnimism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}\n\n== Other usages ==\n\n=== Science and animism ===\nIn the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).\n\nThe physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for \"quantum animism\" in which mind permeates the world at every level.\n\n{{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of \"quantum animism\" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level. If the world is truly quantum animated, then there is an immense amount of invisible inner experience going on all around us that is presently inaccessible to humans, because our own inner lives are imprisoned inside a small quantum system, isolated deep in the meat of an animal brain.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nick|last= Herbert|authorlink=Nick Herbert (physicist)|title= Holistic Physics \u2013 or \u2013 An Introduction to Quantum Tantra|date=2002|accessdate=2014-05-01 |url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/16/herbert.essay.htm|publisher=southerncrossreview.org}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Werner Krieglstein]] wrote regarding his quantum Animism:\n\n{{quote|Herbert's quantum Animism differs from traditional Animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.<ref>Werner J.

Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers, and is\u2014according to western science's own dictates\u2014epistemologically on a par with rather than superior to such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the \"objects\" we encounter\u2014rocks, trees, rivers, other animals\u2014thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, and, indeed, the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licenced as equally valid world-views to the modern western scientific one\u2014indeed, they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when \"objective existence\" is separated from \"subjective experience.\"\n\n=== Socio-political impact ===\n\nHarvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords \"intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire\" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}\n\n=== In art and literature ===\nAnimist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}\n\nHarvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]],  [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]],  [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=January 31, 2010|publisher=The Independent|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.

Born in [[Venice]], the capital of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s. His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]''.\n\nMany of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]'', a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]]) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [[Venice]], [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]]. After meeting the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for [[Clergy|preferment]]. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died, in poverty, less than a year later.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Chiesa di San Giovanni in Bragora - Venezia.jpg|thumb|Church where Vivaldi was baptised, [[San Giovanni in Bragora]], [[Castello, Venice|Sestiere di Castello]], Venice]]\n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on 4 March 1678 in Venice,<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /> then the capital of the Venetian Republic. He was [[Baptism|baptized]] immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though the reasons for the child's immediate baptism are not known for certain, it was done most likely due either to his poor health or to an [[earthquake]] that shook the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 46.</ref> Vivaldi's official church baptism took place two months later.<ref name=autogenerated5>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M.

It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedelt\u00e0 sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi\u2014the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.<ref>Heller, p. 40</ref>\n\nVivaldi's health was problematic.

Vivaldi said Mass as a priest only a few times, and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties, though he formally remained a member of the priesthood.\n\n===At the ''Conservatorio dell'Ospedale della Piet\u00e0''===\nIn September 1703, Vivaldi became ''maestro di violino'' (master of violin) at an [[orphanage]] called the Pio [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice.<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\">Michael Talbot, \"[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40120 Vivaldi, Antonio]\", ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription required}}</ref> While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as \"the famous composer and violinist\" and said that \"Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.\"<ref>Landon, p. 49</ref>\n\n[[File:8106 - Venezia - Calle della Piet\u00e0 - Lapide Vivaldi - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 8-Aug-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Commemorative plaque beside the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]\nVivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the orphanage.

The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.\n\nShortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.<ref>Heller, p. 77</ref> These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.<ref>Heller, p. 78</ref> In 1704, the position of teacher of ''[[lyra viol|viola all'inglese]]'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.<ref name=Landon26>Landon, p. 26</ref> The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work.

The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The orphanage's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.\n\n===Opera impresario===\n[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''<ref>[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html \"Vivaldi's Venice\"], baroquemusic.org. \"As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, ''Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric''. {{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716.\"</ref>]]\n\nIn early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.<ref>Heller, p. 98</ref> The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nDuring this period, the ''Piet\u00e0'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is now lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments\u2014recorders, oboes, [[Viola d'amore|violas d'amore]], and mandolins\u2014that showcased the range of talents of the girls.<ref>Landon, p. 52</ref>\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\n[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of \"A. Vivaldi\".\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his \"94 operas\". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'', he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas\u2014given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years.<ref>Heller, p. 97</ref> While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.<ref name=Heller114>Heller, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''===\n{{Further information|The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)}}\nIn 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]], in the northwest of Italy.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.</ref> He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Ges\u00f9'' (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.\n\nDuring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le C\u00e8ne]] in 1725.\n\nDuring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Gir\u00f2|Anna Tessieri Gir\u00f2]], who would become his student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and favorite ''[[prima donna]]''.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.</ref> Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi's and Gir\u00f2's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Gir\u00f2 in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\nAt the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La cetra (Vivaldi)|La cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.\n\nAccompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented;<ref>Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).</ref> it garnered six revivals.<ref name=\"Heller114\" /> Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].\n\nLike many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once had been in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.</ref> The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Gir\u00f2.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.</ref>\n\n[[File:Vivaldi caricature.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Caricature]] by P. L. Ghezzi, Rome (1723)<ref>There are only three known surviving depictions of Vivaldi made in his lifetime: this caricature, the woodcut at the beginning of this article, and an oil portrait of the composer and his violin. ''Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' has disputed the authenticity of the last portrait.</ref>]]It is also likely that Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage operas, especially as he took up residence near the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]]. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished<ref>Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': \"Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna.\" Landon, p. 166</ref><ref>Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W.

Formichetti (p. 194) reports that he died during the night and his death was the first registered on the next day. Heller (p. 263) states: \"The composer's death is noted in the official coroner's report and in the burial account book of St. Stephen's Cathedral Parish as having occurred on 28 July 1741\". But the so-called ''Totenbeschauprotokoll'' is not a reliable source, since the date can refer to when the entry was made, not to the actual time of death.</ref> of \"internal [[infection]]\", in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker. On 28 July, Vivaldi was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund. His funeral took place at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]]. Contrary to popular legend, the young [[Joseph Haydn]] had nothing to do with his burial, since no music was performed on that occasion.<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/06/haydn-singing-at-vivaldis-exequies.html \"Haydn Singing at Vivaldi's Exequies: An Ineradicable Myth\"] (Vienna 2014)</ref> The cost of his funeral with a 'Kleingel\u00e4ut' was 19 Gulden 45 Kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nVivaldi was buried next to [[Karlskirche]], a baroque church in an area which is now part of the site of the [[TU Wien]]. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the [[Hotel Sacher]] is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi \"star\" in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.\n\nOnly two, possibly three original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists, was made in 1725 by Fran\u00e7ois Morellon La Cave for the first edition of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 147\u201348.</ref> The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the [[Vatican Library]], and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 87.</ref> The oil painting, which can be seen in the [[International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna]], is anonymous and is thought to depict Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the La Cave engraving.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 148.</ref>\n\n==Style and influence==\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename     = 01 - Vivaldi Spring mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg\n| title        = \"La primavera\" (Spring) \u2013 Movement 1: Allegro from the ''Four Seasons''\n| description  = A 2000 live performance by [[Wichita State University]] Chamber Players.\n}}\nVivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes. Many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant.<!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? -->\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard: three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).<!-- That's four; what were the other two? -->\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nDuring his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout Europe, including France, but after his death his popularity dwindled. After the end of Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, the ''Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.<ref>Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD \"The best of Vivaldi\", published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada</ref>\n\nThe resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. [[Historically informed performance]]s, often on \"original instruments\", have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.\n\nRecent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and ''Dixit Dominus'' (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as \"arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since [\u2026] the 1920s\".<ref>Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', K\u00f6rnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145</ref> Vivaldi's 1730 opera ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697), which had been considered lost, was rediscovered in 2006 by the [[harpsichordist]] and conductor Ond\u0159ej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at [[Prague Castle]] on 3 May 2008\u2014its first performance since 1730.\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi}}\n\nA composition by Vivaldi is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\", a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].\n\n[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (\"The Contest between Harmony and Invention\"), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th century [[program music]].<ref>Gerard Schwarz, ''Musically Speaking \u2013 The Great Works Collection: Vivaldi'' (CVP, Inc., 1995), 13.</ref>\n\nVivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings, and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.\n\nAs well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music. Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music.\n\nSome sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]].\n\n==Catalogs of Vivaldi works==\nVivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]]).\n\nBecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, Fanna numbers{{Clarify|reason=\"Fanna\" is not defined -- was this a person?|date=November 2017}} were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, \"La Notte\" RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1\n\nDespite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.\n\nThis cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.\n\nCompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\". Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to \"adjacent\" works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works.{{Efn|These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net].}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe movie ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice|fr|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of [[Jean-Louis Guillermou]].<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0463283|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}</ref> In 2005, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] commissioned a [[radio play]] about Vivaldi, which was written by [[Sean Riley (playwright)|Sean Riley]].

[[Unteraargletscher]]]]\n[[File:Ausgang Aareschlucht.jpg|thumb|The Aare at [[Innertkirchen]]]]\n[[File:Aareschlucht 166 7.jpg|thumb|Inside the Aare Gorge]]\n\nThe Aare rises in the great [[Aargletschers]] (Aare Glaciers) of the [[Bernese Alps]], in the [[canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]].<ref name=\"CVDE\"/> The [[Finsteraarhorn|Finsteraargletscher]] and [[Lauteraarhorn|Lauteraargletscher]] come together to form the [[Unteraargletscher]] (Lower Aar Glacier), which is the main source of water for the [[Grimselsee]] (Lake of Grimsel).<ref name=GH>{{harvnb|Gresswell|Huxley|1965|p=27}}</ref><ref name=cohen>{{harvnb|Cohen|1998|p=1}}</ref> The [[Oberaargletscher]] (Upper Aar Glacier) feeds the [[Oberaarsee]], which also flows into the Grimselsee.<ref name=GH/> The Aare leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the [[Grimsel Hospiz]], below the [[Grimsel Pass]], and then flows northwest through the [[Haslital]], forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on}}, past [[Guttannen]].\n\nRight after [[Innertkirchen]] it is joined by its first major tributary, the [[Gamderwasser]]. Less than {{convert|1|km}} later the river carves through a [[limestone]] ridge in the [[Aare Gorge]] ({{lang-de|Aareschlucht}}).<ref name=CVDE /> It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge.<ref name=GH/> A little past [[Meiringen]], near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]]. Near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important [[tributary]], the [[L\u00fctschine]], by the Lake of Brienz. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli (Swiss German diminutive for ground) between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before flowing into [[Lake Thun]].<ref name=CVDE />\n\nNear the west end of Lake Thun, the river indirectly receives the waters of the [[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]], by the Lake of Thun. Lake Thun marks the [[head of navigation]].<ref name=cohen/> On flowing out of the lake it passes through [[Thun]], and then flows through the city of [[Bern]], passing beneath [[List of Aare bridges in Bern|eighteen bridges]] and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the [[Old City of Berne]] is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Saane/Sarine|Saane or La Sarine]] it turns north until it nears [[Aarberg]]. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the [[Jura water correction]], the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a [[swampland]] through frequent flooding, was diverted by the [[Aare-Hagneck Canal]] into the [[Lac de Bienne]]. From the upper end of the lake, at [[Nidau]], the river issues through the [[Nidau-B\u00fcren Canal]], also called the Aare Canal,<ref name=GH/> and then runs east to [[B\u00fcren, Solothurn|B\u00fcren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".\n\nFrom here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]]<ref name=CVDE /> (below which the Grosse [[Emme (river)|Emme]] flows in on the right), [[Aarburg]] (where it is joined by the [[Wigger (river)|Wigger]]), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]],<ref name=CVDE /> near which is the junction with the [[Suhre]], and Wildegg, where the Seetal [[Aabach (Seetal)|Aabach]] falls in on the right. A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], its major tributary, and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]], its second strongest tributary. It now turns to north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the [[Rhine]], which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downstream from [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz (Switzerland)]], opposite [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]] in Germany. The Rhine, in turn, empties into the [[North Sea]] after crossing into the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== Tributaries ==\n[[File:Aare - Limmat (Limmatspitz) IMG 6765.jpg|thumb|At the \"Wasserschloss\", where the rivers Aare, Reuss and Limmat flow together]]\n[[File:Bern 2.jpg|thumb|Aare in [[Bern]]]]\n[[File:London2007zurich img 5743.jpg|thumb|The convergence of the Aare and the Rhine at Koblenz]]\n\n*[[Limmat]] (after and northeast of [[Brugg]], and northwest of [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]])\n**[[Reppisch]]\n**[[Sihl]]\n***[[Alp (river)|Alp]]\n***[[Minster (river)|Minster]]\n**[[Lake Zurich]]\n***[[Linthkanal]]\n****[[Lake Walen]]\n*****[[Linth]]\n******[[L\u00f6ntsch]]\n******[[Sernf]]\n******[[Fl\u00e4tschbach]]\n*****[[Seez (river)|Seez]]\n*[[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] (after and northeast of [[Brugg]], and northwest of Baden)\n**[[Lorze]]\n**[[Kleine Emme]]\n**[[Lake Lucerne]]\n***[[Sarner Aa]]\n***[[Engelberger Aa]]\n***[[Muota (river)|Muota]]\n**[[Sch\u00e4chen]]\n**[[Ch\u00e4rstelenbach]]\n**[[G\u00f6schener Reuss]]\n*[[Aabach (Seetal)|Aabach]] (coming from Seetal, in [[M\u00f6riken-Wildegg|Wildegg]])\n**[[B\u00fcnz]]\n*[[Suhre]] (after and north of [[Aarau]])\n**[[Wyna]]\n*Aabach (from the left in Aarau)\n*Stegbach\n*[[D\u00fcnnern]] (in [[Olten]])\n*[[Wigger (river)|Wigger]] (right before [[Aarburg]])\n*[[Murg (Aare)|Murg]] (before, west of [[Murgenthal]])\n**Rot ([[Roggwil, Bern|Roggwil]])\n**Langete ([[Langenthal]])\n***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil)\n***Rotbach ([[Huttwil]])\n*[[Emme (river)|(Grosse) Emme]] (after, east of [[Solothurn]])\n*[[Lake of Bienne]]\n**[[Suze (river)|La Suze]] (in [[Biel/Bienne]], right next to the outflow)\n**[[Zihlkanal]]\n***[[Lake of Neuchatel]]\n****[[Broye|La Broye]] (flows through [[Lake Morat]])\n****[[Zihl|Zihl/La Thielle]]\n*****[[Orbe (river)|L'Orbe]]\n*****[[Talent (river)|Le Talent]]\n*[[Saane/Sarine|Saane/La Sarine]] (after, west of Wohlensee)\n**[[Sense (river)|Sense]]\n*[[G\u00fcrbe]] (in [[Muri bei Bern]])\n*[[Zulg]] (west of [[Steffisburg]])\n*[[Lake Thun]]\n**[[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]] (west of [[Spiez]])\n***[[Simme]]\n***[[Entschlige]]\n*[[Lake Brienz]]\n**[[L\u00fctschine]] (at the end of Lake Brienz, right next to the outflow)\n*[[Gadmerwasser]] (right after, northwest of [[Innertkirchen]])\n\n==Reservoirs==\n* [[Lake Grimsel]],<ref name=a1>{{harvnb|Anon|1973|p=74}}</ref> {{convert|1908|m|ft}}\n* [[Lake Brienz]],<ref name=a1/> {{convert|564|m|ft}}<ref name=GH1>{{harvnb|Gresswell|Huxley|1965|p=272}}</ref>\n* [[Lake Thun]],<ref name=a1/> {{convert|558|m|ft}}<ref name=GH1/>\n* [[Lake Wohlen]],<ref name=a2>{{harvnb|Anon|1973|p=70}}</ref> {{convert|481|m|ft}}\n* [[Niederriedsee]],<ref name=a2/> {{convert|461|m|ft}}\n* [[Lake Biel]],<ref name=a2/> {{convert|429|m|ft}}\n* [[Klingnauer Stausee]], {{convert|318|m|ft}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = Anon | year = 1973 | title = Atlas Routier et Touristique | language = French | publisher = Bordas-Tirade | location = Paris, France | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor1-last = Bridgwater | editor1-first = W.| editor2-last = Aldrich | editor2-first = Beatrice | encyclopedia = The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia | title = Aare | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York, NY | year = 1968 | isbn = 978-0670230709 | edition = 3rd | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = Saul B. | encyclopedia = The Columbia Gazetteer of the World | title = Aare | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-231-11040-5 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Forbiger | first = Albert | title = Handbuch Der Alten Geographie | volume = 3 | publisher = Veriag von Gustav Mayer | location = Leipzig, Germany | year = 1848 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AvwoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA127 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | editor-last1 = Gresswell | editor-first1 = R.

bank of the [[River Tweed]]. It was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet, Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It is a Category A [[Listed Building]].{{sfn|Historic Scotland staff|2010}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Abbotsford by Henry Fox Talbot.jpg|thumb|left|Abbotsford by [[Henry Fox Talbot]], 1844]]\nThe nucleus of the estate was a small farm of {{convert|100|acre|km2}}, called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  \n\nHe first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] nearby where previously [[abbot]]s of [[Melrose Abbey]] used to cross the river. Scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland. In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with [[Scottish history]], notably the Celtic [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] and the [[Woodwrae Stone]], all now in the [[Museum of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nms.ac.uk/torrsponycap|title=Torrs pony cap|publisher=Museum of Scotland|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/34845/woodrae-castle|title=Woodrae Castle: Cross Slab(S) (Pictish), Pictish Symbol Stone(S) (Pictish)|work=Canmore|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe last and principal acquisition was that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817. The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n[[File:Abbotsford.House.ground.plan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ground plan of Abbotsford House.]]\nThe general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the [[Scottish Baronial]]. Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|old Tolbooth]] in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nScott had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt. In 1830, the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors. The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by [[Robert Cadell]], the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir Walter's works.  {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nScott's only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847. Among subsequent possessors were Scott's son-in-law, [[John Gibson Lockhart]], [[James Hope-Scott|J. R. Hope Scott]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], and his daughter (Scott's great-granddaughter), the Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Abbotsford Aug2009 01.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2|Abbotsford House as seen from the gardens.]]\nThe house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by Scott's descendants until 2004. The last of his direct descendants to hold the [[Laird]]ship of Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter Dame [[Jean Maxwell-Scott]] (8 June 1923 \u2013 5 May 2004). She inherited it from her elder sister [[Patricia Maxwell-Scott]] in 1998. The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions, after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house. It had electricity installed only in 1962. \n\nDame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], patron of the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier|Dandie Dinmont]] Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Sydney Morning Herald staff|2004|p=32}}\n\nIn 2005, [[Scottish Borders Council]] was considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which [[Historic Scotland]] and the [[National Trust for Scotland]] objected.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/after-200-years-scott-house-leaves-family-cw28k8qwk60|title=After 200 years Scott house leaves family|last=English|first=Shirley|date=19 May 2005|work=The Times|accessdate=22 September 2017|dead-url=|location=London|registration=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Fairburn|first=Robert|title=Housing plan put on hold|date=6 December 2005|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=2357362005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516075613/http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=2357362005|work=The Scotsman|archivedate=16 May 2007}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Presumably the application has not taken 12 years to consider|date=September 2017}}\n\nSir Walter Scott rescued the \"[[jougs]]\" from [[Threave Castle]] in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.{{sfn|Napier|1897|p=153}}\n\n[[Tweedbank railway station]] is located near to Abbotsford House.\n\n==Miscellaneous==\nAbbotsford gave its name to the [[Abbotsford Club]], founded by [[William Barclay Turnbull]] in 1833 or 1834 in Scott's honour, and a successor to the [[Bannatyne Club|Bannatyne]] and [[Maitland Club]]s. It was a [[text publication society]], which existed to print and publish historical works connected with Scott's writings. Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 2012, a new Visitor Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, gift shop and Ochiltree's Dining, a caf\u00e9/restaurant with views over the house and grounds.\n\nIn 2014 it won the [[European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards|European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award]] for its recent conservation project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/awards/137/ |title=Europa Nostra |publisher=Europa Nostra |accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-283_en.htm |title=European Commission \u2013 PRESS RELEASES \u2013 Press release \u2013 Winners of 2014 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards announced |publisher=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visitors Centre, Abbotsford.jpg|thumb|centre|Visitors Centre, Abbotsford]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places in the Scottish Borders]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|ref=harv |origyear=1971 |year=2010 |url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB15104 |title=Abbotsford Including House, Walled Gardens and Courtyards, Conservatory, Bothies, Game Larder, Ice H, Melrose |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 September 2016}}\n*{{Citation|last=Napier |first=George G. |year=1897 |title=The Home and Haunts of Sir Walter Scott, Bart |publisher=James Maclehose |location=Glasgow |page= [https://archive.org/stream/homesandhauntss00napigoog#page/n221/mode/1up 153]}}\n*{{Citation|title=Obituary of Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 July 2004 |page=32}}\n\n'''Attribution'''\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Abbotsford|volume=1}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Abbotsford House}}\n*[http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/ Abbotsford \u2013 The Home of Sir Walter Scott] \u2013 official site\n*[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/55750/details/abbotsford+house/ RCAHMS / CANMORE site record for Abbotsford House]\n*[http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/homes.html Edinburgh University Library]\n*[https://archive.org/details/abbotsford00crociala Abbotsford] (by W S Crockett \u2013 1904 illustrated book pub.

Abraham is called by [[God]] to leave the house of his father [[Terah]] and settle in the land originally given to [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]] but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to [[Ishmael]] about founding a great nation, [[Isaac]], Abraham's son by his half-sister [[Sarah]], inherits God's promises to Abraham. Abraham purchases a tomb (the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]) at [[Hebron]] to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance. Abraham later marries [[Keturah]] and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives \"all Abraham's goods\", while the other sons receive only \"gifts\" (Genesis 25:5\u20138).{{sfn|Ska|2009|pp=26\u201331}}\n\nThe Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the [[patriarchal age]], along with the [[The Exodus|exodus]] and the period of the judges, is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history.{{sfn|McNutt|1999|pp=41\u201342}} A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in [[Yehud Medinata|Judah]] during the [[Babylonian captivity]] and traced their right to the land through their \"father Abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on [[Moses]] and [[the Exodus]] tradition.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=227\u201328, 260}}\n\n== Biblical account ==\n[[File:Moln\u00e1r \u00c1brah\u00e1m kik\u00f6lt\u00f6z\u00e9se 1850.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Abraham's departure by [[J\u00f3zsef Moln\u00e1r (painter)|J\u00f3zsef Moln\u00e1r]]]]\n===Origins and calling===\n[[Terah]], the ninth in descent from [[Noah]], was the father of three sons: Abram, [[Nahor, son of Terah|Nahor]], and [[Haran]]. In his youth, [[Abraham_and_the_Idol_Shop|Abram worked in Terah's idol shop]]. Haran was the father of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], and thus Lot was Abram's nephew. Haran died in his native city, [[Ur of the Chaldees]]. \n\nAbram married [[Sarah|Sarah (Sarai)]], who was barren. Terah, with<!-- NOT Nahor,--> Abram, Sarai, and Lot, then departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]], where Terah died at the age of 205.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:27\u201332|niv}} God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:1\u20133|niv}} Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]].{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:4\u20136|niv}}\n\n===Sarai===\n[[File:Tissot Abram's Counsel to Sarai.jpg|thumb|left|230px|''Abraham's Counsel to Sarai'' (watercolor c. 1896\u20131902 by [[James Tissot]])]]\nThere was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, traveled to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].

This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst brethren. Lot chose to go eastward to the plain of [[Jordan River|Jordan]] where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abram went south to [[Hebron]] and settled in the plain of [[Mamre]], where he built another altar to worship [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]].<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246613/jewish/Abram-and-Lot.htm \"Abram and Lot Separate\", Chabad.org]</ref>\n\n===Chedorlaomer===\n{{Main article|Battle of Siddim}}\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|175px|Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek (painting c. 1464\u20131467 by [[Dieric Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]])]]\nDuring the rebellion of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Jordan River cities]] against [[Elam]],{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:1\u20139|niv}} Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading [[Elam]]ite forces.

Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim|Battle of Siddim]]. When they caught up with them at [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King [[Chedorlaomer]] at Hobah, just north of [[Damascus]]. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:13\u201316|niv}}\n\nUpon Abram's return, Sodom's king came out to meet with him in the [[King's dale|Valley of Shaveh]], the \"king's dale\". Also, [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem ([[Jerusalem]]), a priest of [[Elyon|God Most High]], brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a [[tithe|tenth]] of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people.

Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar]], to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son.\n\nAfter Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Sarai responded by mistreating Hagar, and Hagar fled into the wilderness. An angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain on the way to [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. He instructed her to return to the camp of Abram, and that her son would be \"a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.\" She was told to call her son [[Ishmael]]. Hagar then called God who spoke to her \"[[El Roi|El-roi]]\", (\"Thou God seest me:\" KJV).

They walked over to the peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that \"if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?\" For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|18:17\u201333|niv}}\n\nWhen the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two \"men\" stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may \"know\" (v.5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not \"known\" (v.8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot's door to get to his male guests,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:1\u20139|niv}} thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:12\u201313|niv}}\n\nEarly the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God.

While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King [[Abimelech]] had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:1\u20137|niv}}\n\nEarly next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:12||Genesis 20:12|niv}} Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands.

Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:8\u201318|niv}}\n\nAfter living for some time in the land of the Philistines, [[Abimelech]] and [[Phicol]], the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of [[Abraham's well]]. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: [[Beersheba]]. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to [[Philistia]], Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called upon \"the name of the {{LORD}}, the everlasting God.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:22\u201334||Genesis 21:22\u201334|niv}}\n\n===Isaac===\n[[File:Sacrifice of Isaac-Caravaggio (Uffizi).jpg|thumb|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Caravaggio]]]]\nAs had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:21|niv}} Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision.

Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that \"in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.\"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:12|niv}} He also said that Ishmael would make a nation, \"because he is thy seed\".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:9\u201313|niv}}\n\nEarly the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together.

After God heard the boy's voice, an [[angel of the Lord]] confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation, and will be \"living on his sword\".

Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied \"God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering\". Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the Lord, and he saw behind him a \"ram caught in a thicket by his horns\", which he sacrificed instead of his son.

Albright]] and biblical scholars such as [[Albrecht Alt]] believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the \"[[patriarchal age]]\", the 2nd millennium BCE. But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in  [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' (1974), and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were [[Iron Age]] creations.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=18\u201319}} By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures.{{sfn|Dever|2002|p=98 and fn.2}}\n\n==={{anchor|Renaming}} Origins of the narrative===\nAbraham's name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in Genesis no longer understands its original meaning (probably \"Father is exalted\" \u2013 the meaning offered in Genesis 17:5, \"Father of a multitude\", is a [[false etymology|popular etymology]]).{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=23\u201324}} The story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory.{{sfn|Pitard|2001|p=27}} At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the [[Pentateuch]]; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520\u2013320 BCE.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=260}} The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown,{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=26}} but there are currently two important hypotheses.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=217, 227\u201328}} The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay \"elders\".{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=217, 227\u201328}}\n\nNevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones \u2013 the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions.{{sfn|Carr|Conway|2010|p=193}} In [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ezek|33:24|niv}}, written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe Torah.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=43}} [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|63:16|niv}} similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the \"[[Golah|g\u00f4l\u00e2]]\"), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=44}} The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., [[Ezra-Nehemiah]]), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=44}}\n\n== Religious traditions ==\n{{Infobox saint\n|name = Abraham\n|feast_day = 9 October \u2013 Roman Catholicism\n|venerated_in = {{hlist <!--chronological:-->|[[Judaism]] |[[Christianity]] |[[Islam]] |[[Baha'i Faith]]}}\n|image = Aert de Gelder 009.jpg\n|imagesize = 200px\n|caption = ''Abraham and the Angels'' by [[Aert de Gelder]] ([[Circa|c.]]&nbsp;1680\u201385)\n|titles = First Patriarch\n}}\n\n===Overview===\nAbraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

[[Rembrandt]] (Dutch, 1606\u20131669) created at least seven works on Abraham, [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577\u20131640) did several, [[Marc Chagall]] did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Dor\u00e9 (French illustrator, 1832\u20131883) did six, and [[James Tissot]] (French painter and illustrator, 1836\u20131902) did over twenty works on the subject.<ref name = \"Abeart\"/>\n\n[[File:Isaac sarcifice Pio Christiano Inv31648.jpg|thumb|16th century plaster cast of a late Roman era [[Sacrifice of Isaac]]. The hand of God originally came down to restrain Abraham's knife (both are now missing).]]\nThe [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used for the burial of [[Junius Bassus]]. He died in 359. This sarcophagus has been described as \"probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.\"<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_early_christian_studies/v001/1.1.rutgers.html Journal of Early Christian Studies], Leonard Victor Rutgers, ''The Iconography of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus'' (review of Malbon book), Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1993, pp. 94\u201396; for Janson it is also the \"finest Early Christian sarcophagus\".</ref> The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], was rediscovered in 1597,<ref>or 1595, see Elsner, p. 86n.</ref> and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]) in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The base is approximately 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 feet. The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the [[New Testament]], in an early form of [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.\n\n[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work ''Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael''. The human condition was central to his concerns, and Segal used the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110429085513/http://www.miamiartmuseum.org/collection-selected-segalgeorge.asp Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael.

In solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his attribute, as in [[:commons:File:AbrahamMorlaiterJRS.JPG|this statue]] by Gian Maria Morlaiter or [[:commons:File:AbrahamMonacoJRS.jpg|this painting]] by Lorenzo Monaco. He always wears a gray or white beard.\n\nAs early as the beginning of the 3rd century, Christian art followed Christian [[Typology (theology)#Sacrifice of Isaac|typology]] in making the sacrifice of Isaac a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice on the cross and its memorial in the sacrifice of the Mass. See for example [[:commons:File:AltarFuldaClunyJRS.jpg|this 11th-century Christian altar]] engraved with Abraham's and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of Christ in the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianiconography.info/abraham.html |title=Abraham the Patriarch in Art \u2013  Iconography and Literature | publisher=Christian Iconography \u2013  a project of [[Georgia Regents University]]. |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref>\n\nSome early Christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the [[triune God]]. Thus in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, [[:commons:File:HospitalityAbrahamSMMaggioreJRS.jpg|a 5th-century mosaic]] portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the \"heavenly\" space above the scene. In Eastern Orthodox art the visit is the chief means by which the Trinity is pictured ([[:commons:File:Russian - Hospitality of Abraham - Walters 371185.jpg|example]]).

Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son.{{sfn|Kierkegaard|1980|pp=155\u201356}}\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1994, [[Steve Reich]] released an opera named ''[[The Cave (opera)|The Cave]]''. The title refers to the  [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. The narrative of the opera is based on the story of Abraham and his immediate family as it is recounted in the various religious texts, and as it is understood by individual people from different cultures and religious traditions.\n\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Highway 61 Revisited (song)|Highway 61 Revisited]]\"<ref>[http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/highway-61-revisited \"Highway 61 Revisited\"].

The passage is miserably corrupt: but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make Abraxas.\n\nThe proper form of the name is evidently ''Abrasax'', as with the Greek writers, Hippolytus, Epiphanias, Didymus (''De Trin''. iii. 42), and Theodoret; also [[Augustine]] and 'Praedestinatus'; and in nearly all the legends on gems. By a probably euphonic inversion the translator of Irenaeus and the other Latin authors have ''Abraxas'', which is found in the magical papyri, and even, though most sparingly, on engraved stones.\n\nThe attempts to discover a derivation for the name, Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, or other, have not been entirely successful:\n\n=== Egyptian ===\n* [[Claudius Salmasius]] thought it Egyptian, but never gave the proofs which he promised.\n*J. J. Bellermann thinks it a compound of the Egyptian words ''abrak'' and ''sax'', meaning \u201cthe honorable and hallowed word,\u201d or \u201cthe word is adorable.\u201d\n* [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] finds in it an Egyptian invocation to the Godhead, meaning \u201churt me not.\u201d\n\n=== Hebrew ===\n* Abraham Geiger sees in it a Grecized form of ''ha-berakhah'', \u201cthe blessing,\u201d a meaning which C.W. King declares philologically untenable.\n*J. B. Passerius derives it from ''abh'', \u201cfather,\u201d ''bara'', \u201cto create,\u201d and ''a-'' negative\u2014\u201cthe uncreated Father.\u201d\n*Giuseppe Barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]], the literal rendering of which is \u201cO [God], with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy [people],\u201d forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word ''Abrakd'' (pronounced Abrakad), with the meaning \u201cthe host of the winged ones,\u201d i.e., angels. While this theory can explain the mystic word ''Abracadabra'', the association of this phrase with Abrasax is uncertain.\n\n=== Greek ===\n* Wendelin discovers a compound of the initial letters, amounting to 365 in numerical value, of four Hebrew and three Greek words, all written with Greek characters: ''ab, ben, rouach, hakad\u014ds; s\u014dt\u0113ria apo xylou'' (\u201cFather, Son, Spirit, holy; salvation from the cross\u201d).\n*According to a note of Isaac de Beausobre\u2019s, [[Jean Hardouin]] accepted the first three of these, taking the four others for the initials of the Greek ''anthr\u014dpouss\u014dz\u014dn hagi\u014di xyl\u014di'', \u201csaving mankind by the holy cross.\u201d\n* [[Isaac de Beausobre]] derives Abrasax from the Greek ''habros'' and ''sa\u014d'', \u201cthe beautiful, the glorious Savior.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by [[Adolf von Harnack]],<ref>{{cite journal|first=Adolf von|last=Harnack|title=\u00dcber das gnostische Buch Pistis-Sophia|journal=TU|volume=vii. 2|year=1891|pages=86\u201389}}</ref> \u201cwhich belong to no known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe Egyptian author of the book ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum|De Mysteriis]]'' in reply to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (vii. 4) admits a preference of 'barbarous' to vernacular names in sacred things, urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations, as the Egyptians and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and Origen (''Contra Cels''. i. 24) refers to the 'potent names' used by Egyptian sages, [[Persia]]n [[Magi]], and Indian [[Brahmin]]s, signifying deities in the several languages.\n\n== Sources ==\nIt is uncertain what the actual role and function of Abraxas was in the [[Basilideans|Basilidian system]], as our authorities (see below) often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of [[Basilides]] himself.\n\n=== As an Archon ===\n[[File:Abraxas3.jpg|thumb|right|Gemstone carved with Abraxas, obverse and reverse.]]\n\nIn the system described by [[Irenaeus]], \"the Unbegotten Father\" is the progenitor of ''[[Nous]]'', and from ''Nous [[Logos]]'', from ''Logos [[Phronesis]]'', from ''Phronesis [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' and ''[[Dunamis|Dynamis]]'', from ''Sophia'' and ''Dynamis'' principalities, powers, and angels, the last of whom create \"the first heaven.\" They in turn originate a second series, who create a second heaven. The process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence, the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> \"The ruler\" [''principem, i.e.'', probably ''ton [[archon (Gnosticism)|archonta]]''] of the 365 heavens \"is Abraxas, and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers.\"\n\nThe name occurs in the ''[[Philosophumena|Refutation of all Heresies]]'' (vii. 26) by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], who appears in these chapters to have followed the ''Exegetica'' of Basilides. After describing the manifestation of the Gospel in the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, he adds that the Basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several 'stages' of the upper world (''diastemata''), in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that \"their great archon\" is Abrasax, because his name contains the number 365, the number of the days in the year; i.e. the sum of the numbers denoted by the Greek letters in \u0391\u0392\u03a1\u0391\u03a3\u0391\u039e according to the rules of [[isopsephy]] is 365:\n\n:\u0391 = 1, \u0392 = 2, \u03a1 = 100, \u0391 = 1, \u03a3 = 200, \u0391 = 1, \u039e = 60\n\n=== As a god ===\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] (''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 69, 73 f.) appears to follow partly Irenaeus, partly the lost Compendium of Hippolytus.<ref>Lipsius, R. A., ''Zur Quellenkritik d. Epiphanios'' 99 f.</ref> He designates Abraxas more distinctly as \"the power above all, and First Principle,\" \"the cause and first archetype\" of all things; and mentions that the Basilidians referred to 365 as the number of parts (''mele'') in the human body, as well as of days in the year.\n\nThe author of the appendix to Tertullian ''De Praescr. Haer''. (c. 4), who likewise follows Hippolytus's Compendium,<ref>Lipsius 33 f. &c.</ref> adds some further particulars; that 'Abraxas' gave birth to Mind (''nous''), the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by Irenaeus and Epiphanius; that the world, as well as the 365 heavens, was created in honour of 'Abraxas;' and that Christ was sent not by the Maker of the world but by 'Abraxas.'\n\nNothing can be built on the vague allusions of [[Jerome]], according to whom 'Abraxas' meant for Basilides \"the greatest God\" (''De vir. ill''. 21), \"the highest God\" (''Dial. adv. Lucif''. 23), \"the Almighty God\" (''Comm. in Amos'' iii. 9), and \"the Lord the Creator\" (''Comm. in Nah''. i. 11). The notices in [[Theodoret]] (''Haer. fab''. i. 4), [[Augustine]] (''Haer''. 4), and 'Praedestinatus' (i. 3), have no independent value.\n\nIt is evident from these particulars that Abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 Archons, and accordingly stood below Sophia and Dynamis and their progenitors; but his position is not expressly stated, so that the writer of the supplement to Tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with \"the Supreme God.\"\n\n=== As an Aeon ===\n[[File:Abraxas Infernal Dictionary.png|thumb|Abraxas from Infernal Dictionary, 6th Edition, 1863]]\nWith the availability of primary sources, such as those in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], the identity of Abrasax remains unclear. The ''Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit'', for instance, refers to Abrasax as an [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]] dwelling with [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] and other Aeons of the [[Pleroma]] in the light of the luminary [[Eleleth]]. In several texts, the luminary Eleleth is the last of the luminaries (Spiritual Lights) that come forward, and it is the Aeon Sophia, associated with Eleleth, who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the Demiurge's rule of this world, and the salvage effort that ensues. As such, the role of Aeons of Eleleth, including Abraxas, Sophia, and others, pertains to this outer border of the Pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of Lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality.\n\n=== As a demon ===\nThe Catholic church later deemed Abraxas a pagan god, and ultimately branded him a demon as documented in J. Collin de Plancy's ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal|Infernal Dictionary]]'', Abraxas (or Abracax) is labeled the \"supreme God\" of the Basilidians, whom he describes as \"heretics of the second century.\" He further indicated the Basilidians attributed to Abraxas the rule over \"365 skies\" and \"365 virtues\". In a final statement on Basilidians, de Plancy states that their view was that Jesus Christ was merely a \"benevolent ghost sent on Earth by Abracax.\"<ref name=\"de Plancy 2015 764\">{{cite book|title=Infernal Dictionary Deluxe Edition|first=J Collin|last=de Plancy|publisher=Abracax House|year=2015|ISBN=0997074515|pages=764}}</ref>\n\n== Abrasax stones ==\nA vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name \"Abrasax-stones\" has long been given. One particularly fine example was included as part of the [[Thetford treasure]] from fourth century Norfolk, UK. The subjects are mythological, and chiefly grotesque, with various inscriptions, in which \u0391\u0392\u03a1\u0391\u03a3\u0391\u039e often occurs, alone or with other words. Sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription. In certain obscure magical writings of Egyptian origin \u1f00\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03ac\u03c2 or \u1f00\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03be is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems;<ref>Reuvens (1830). ''Lett, \u00e0 M. Letronne s. I. Pap. bilingues'', etc., Leyden</ref> it is also found on the Greek metal ''tesser\u00e6'' among other mystic words. The meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible: but some of the gems are amulets; and the same may be the case with nearly all.\n\n[[File:Montfaucon 358 Abraxas.xcf|thumb|A print from [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' (Band 2,2 page 358 ff plaque 144) with different images of Abraxas.]]\n\n*'''The Abrasax-image alone, without external Iconisms, and either without, or but a simple, inscription.''' The Abrasax-imago proper is usually found with a shield, a sphere or wreath and whip, a sword or sceptre, a cock's head, the body clad with armor, and a serpent's tail. There are, however, innumerable modifications of these figures: Lions', hawks', and eagles' skins, with or without mottos, with or without a trident and star, and with or without reverses.\n*'''Abrasax ''combined'' with other Gnostic Powers.''' If, in a single instance, this supreme being was represented in connection with powers of subordinate rank, nothing could have been more natural than to represent it also in combination with its emanations, the seven superior spirits, the thirty Aeons, and the three hundred and sixty-five cosmical Genii; and yet this occurs upon none of the relics as yet discovered, whilst those with Powers not belonging to the Gnostic system are frequently met with.\n*'''Abrasax with Jewish symbols.''' This combination predominates, not indeed with symbolical figures, but in the form of inscriptions, such as: ''[[Archon#Gnosticism|Iao]], [[Elohim|Eloai]], [[Adonai]], [[Sabaoth]], Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Onoel, Ananoel, Raphael, Japlael'', and many others. The name \u0399\u0391\u03a9, to which \u03a3\u0391\u0392\u0391\u03a9\u0398 is sometimes added, is found with this figure even more frequently than \u0391\u0392\u03a1\u0391\u03a3\u0391\u039e, and they are often combined. Beside an Abrasax figure the following, for instance, is found: \u0399\u0391\u03a9 \u0391\u0392\u03a1\u0391\u03a3\u0391\u039e \u0391\u0394\u03a9\u039d \u0391\u03a4\u0391, \"Iao Abrasax, thou art the Lord\".<ref>Bellermann, ''Versuch,'' iii., No. 10.</ref> With the Abrasax-shield are also found the divine names Sabaoth Iao, Iao Abrasax, Adonai Abrasax, etc.<ref>Baudissin, ''Studien zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte,'' i. 189 et seq.</ref>\n*'''Abrasax with Persian deities.''' Chiefly, perhaps exclusively, in combination with [[Mithras]], and possibly a few specimens with the mystical gradations of ''mithriaca'', upon Gnostic relics.\n*'''Abrasax with Egyptian deities.''' It is represented as a figure, with the sun-god Phre leading his chariot, or standing upon a lion borne by a crocodile; also as a name, in connection with [[Isis]], [[Ptah|Phtha]], [[Neith]], [[Hathor|Athor]], [[Thoth|Thot]], [[Anubis]], [[Horus]], and [[Harpocrates]] in a Lotus-leaf; also with a representation of the Nile, the symbol of prolificacy, with [[Agathodaemon]] ([[Chnuphis]]), or with [[scarabs]], the symbols of the revivifying energies of nature.\n*'''Abrasax with Grecian deities''', sometimes as a figure, and again with the simple name, in connection with the planets, especially [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Hecate]], and [[Zeus (mythology)|Zeus]], richly engraved.\n*'''Simple or ornamental representations of the journey of departed spirits through the starry world to [[Amenti]]''', borrowed, as those above-named, from the Egyptian religion. The spirit wafted from the earth, either with or without the corpse, and transformed at times into [[Osiris]] or [[Helios]], is depicted as riding upon the back of a crocodile, or lion, guided in some instances by Anubis, and other genii, and surrounded by stars; and thus attended hastening to judgment and a higher life.\n*'''Representations of the [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgment]]''', which, like the preceding, are either ornamental or plain, and imitations of Egyptian art, with slight modifications and prominent symbols, as the vessel in which Anubis weighs the human heart, as comprehending the entire life of man, with all its errors.\n*'''Worship and consecrating services''' were, according to the testimony of [[Origen]] in his description of tho [[Ophite Diagrams|ophitic diagram]], conducted with figurative representations in the secret assemblies of the Gnostics unless indeed the statement on which this opinion rests designates, as it readily may, a statue of glyptic workmanship. It is uncertain if any of the discovered specimens actually represent the Gnostic cultus and religious ceremonies, although upon some may be seen an Abrasax-figure laying its hand upon a person kneeling, as though for baptism or benediction.\n*'''Astrological groups'''. The Gnostics referred everything to astrology. Even the Bardesenists located the inferior powers, the seven, twelve and thirty-six, among the planets, in the zodiac and starry region, as rulers of the celestial phenomena which influence the earth and its inhabitants. Birth and health, wealth and allotment, are considered to be mainly under their control. Other sects betray still stronger partiality for astrological conceits. Many of these specimens also are improperly ascribed to Gnosticism, but the Gnostic origin of others is too manifest to allow of contradiction.\n*'''Inscriptions''', of which there are three kinds:\n**Those destitute of symbols or iconisms, engraved upon stone, iron, lead and silver plates, in Greek, Latin, Coptic or other languages, of amuletic import, and in the form of prayers for health and protection.\n**Those with some symbol, as a serpent in an oval form.\n**Those with iconisms, at times very small, but often made the prominent object, so that the legend is limited to a single word or name. Sometimes the legends are as important as the images. It is remarkable, however, that thus far none of the plates or medals found seem to have any of the forms or prayers reported by Origen. It is necessary to distinguish those specimens that belong to the proper Gnostic period from such as are indisputably of later origin, especially since there is a strong temptation to place those of more recent date among the older class.\n\n===Gallery===\n\n<gallery caption=\"Prints from [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' (Band 2,2) page 358 ff.\">\nFile:Montfaucon 358 Abraxas.xcf|Plaque 144\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 145.xcf|Plaque 145\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 146.xcf|Plaque 146\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 147.xcf|Plaque 147\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 148.xcf|Plaque 148\nFile:Montfaucon Abraxas Plaque 149.xcf|Plaque 149\n</gallery>\n\n=== Anguipede ===\n[[File:Abraxas, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|Engraving from an Abrasax stone.]]\nIn a great majority of instances the name Abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure, having a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]-like appearance somewhat resembling a [[basilisk]] or the Greek primordial god [[Chronos]] (not to be confused with the Greek titan [[Cronus]]). According to [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], \"as a Pantheus, i.e. All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a [[rooster|cock]] ([[Ph\u0153bus]]) or of a lion ([[Ra]] or [[Mithras]]), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the [[Agathodaemon|Agathodaimon]]. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield.\" This form was also referred to as the [[Anguipede]]. Budge surmised that Abrasax was \"a form of the [[Adam Kadmon]] of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] and the Primal Man whom God made in His own image.\"<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = E. A. Wallis Budge | last = Budge |first = E. A. Wallis | title = Amulets and Superstitions | year = 1930 | pages = 209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nSome parts at least of the figure mentioned above are [[solar symbol]]s, and the Basilidian Abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun. J. J. Bellermann has speculated that \"the whole represents the Supreme Being, with his Five great Emanations, each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem. Thus, from the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity, forasmuch as it is written that God created man in his own image, issue the two supporters, ''Nous'' and ''Logos'', symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding, as typified by the serpents, for the same reason that had induced the old Greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to Pallas. His head\u2014a cock's\u2014represents ''Phronesis'', the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance. His two hands bear the badges of ''Sophia'' and ''Dynamis'', the shield of Wisdom, and the scourge of Power.\"<ref>Paraphrased by {{cite book | authorlink = Charles William King | last = King | first = Charles William | title = The Gnostics and Their Remains | year = 1887 | page = 246| url = http://sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nIn the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as Basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin, and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of Gnostics. During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\">{{catholic|wstitle=Abrasax|inline=yes|last=Leclercq|first=Henri|volume=1|year=1913}}</ref>\n* ''Abrasax'', or stones of Basilidian origin<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n* ''Abrasaxtes'', or stones originating in ancient forms of worship and adapted by the Gnostics<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n* ''Abraxo\u00efdes'', or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of Basilides<ref name=\"Leclercq1913\"/>\n\nWhile it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides:\n\n{{quote|These men, moreover, practise magic, and use images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of the angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the first, and others to the second heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names, principles, angels, and powers of the 365 imagined heavens.|''Adversus h\u00e6reses'', I. xxiv. 5; ''cf''. Epiph. ''Haer''. 69 D; Philastr. ''Suer''. 32}}\n\nIncantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid Gnosticism planted in [[Spain]] and southern [[Gaul]] at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, which [[Jerome]] connects with Basilides and which (according to his ''Epist''., lxxv.) used the name Abrasax.\n\nIt is therefore not unlikely that some Gnostics used amulets, though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority. [[Isaac de Beausobre]] properly calls attention to the significant silence of [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of [[Alexandria]] on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them (''Paed''. 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and ''Abrasax'' is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown.\n\n=== Magical papyri ===\nHaving due regard to the [[Greek Magical Papyri|magic papyri]], in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.\n\nThe magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the Abrasax-gems and often bear Hebraic names of God.<ref name=\"BlauKohler\"/> The following example is illustrative: \"I conjure you by [[Yahweh|Ia\u014d]] [[Sabaoth|Saba\u014dth]] [[Adonai|Ad\u014dnai]] Abrasax, and by the great god, [[Yahweh|Iae\u014d]]\".<ref name=\"Betz\">ed.

In the group \"Iakoubia, Ia\u014dsaba\u014dth Ad\u014dnai Abrasax,\"<ref name=\"Betz\" /><ref>''Ibid''. p. 44, No. 715</ref> the first name seems to be composed of [[Jacob]] and Ya. Similarly, entities considered angels in Judaism are invoked as gods alongside Abrasax: thus \"I conjure you... by the god [[Michael (archangel)|Micha\u0113l]], by the god [[Sariel|Souri\u0113l]], by the god [[Gabriel|Gabri\u0113l]], by the god [[Raphael (archangel)|Rapha\u0113l]], by the god Abrasax Ablathanalba Akrammachari...\".<ref name=\"Betz\" />\n\nIn text PGM V. 96-172, Abrasax is identified as part of the \"true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of Israel\" of the \"Headless One, who created heaven and earth, who created night and day... Osoronnophris whom none has ever seen... awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit\"; the name also includes Ia\u014d and Ad\u014dnai.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> \"Osoronnophris\" represents Egyptian ''[[Osiris#Etymology of the name|Wsir]] [[wikt:wnn-nfr#Egyptian|Wn-nfr]]'', \"[[Osiris]] the Perfect Being\".<ref name=\"Betz\" /> Another identification with Osiris is made in PGM VII. 643-51: \"you are not wine, but the guts of Osiris, the guts of... Ablanathanalba Akrammachamarei Eee, who has been stationed over necessity, Iakoub Ia Ia\u014d Saba\u014dth Ad\u014dnai Abrasax.\"<ref name=\"Betz\" /> PGM VIII. 1-63, on the other hand, identifies Abrasax as a name of \"[[Hermes]]\" (i.e. [[Thoth]]).<ref name=\"Betz\" /> Here the numerological properties of the name are invoked, with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its [[isopsephy|isopsephic]] value of 365 corresponding to the days of the year.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> Thoth is also identified with Abrasax in PGM LXXIX. 1-7: \"I am the soul of darkness, Abrasax, the eternal one, Micha\u0113l, but my true name is Th\u014douth, Th\u014douth.\"<ref name=\"Betz\" />\n\nOne papyrus titled the \"Monad\" or the \"Eighth Book of [[Moses]]\" (PGM XIII. 1-343) contains an invocation to a supreme creator God; Abrasax is given as being the name of this God in the language of the baboons.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> The papyrus goes on to describe a cosmogonic myth about Abrasax, describing how he created the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] by laughing. His first laughter created light; his second divided the [[Nu (mythology)|primordial waters]]; his third created the mind; his fourth created fertility and procreation; his fifth created fate; his sixth created time (as the sun and moon); and his seventh and final laughter created the soul.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> Then, from various sounds made by Abrasax, there arose the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]] who \"foreknew all things\", the first man (or [[Phobos (mythology)|Fear]]), and the god [[Yahweh|Ia\u014d]], \"who is lord of all\".<ref name=\"Betz\" /> The man fought with Ia\u014d, and Abrasax declared that Ia\u014d's power would derive from both of the others, and that Ia\u014d would take precedence over all the other gods.<ref name=\"Betz\" /> This text also describes [[Helios]] as an archangel of God/Abrasax.<ref name=\"Betz\" />\n\nThe [[Leyden papyrus X|Leyden Papyrus]] recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon:\n{{quote|[24] Ho! Sax, [[Amun]], Sax, Abrasax; for thou art the moon, (25) the chief of the stars, he that did form them, listen to the things that I have(?) said, follow the (words) of my mouth, reveal thyself to me, Than, (26) Thana, Thanatha, otherwise Thei, this is my correct name.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden (The Leyden Papyrus)|author1=Griffith, F.

However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack.

Absalom was the name of Stephen Kumalo's son in the novel. Like the historical Absalom, Absalom Kumalo was at odds with his father, the two fighting a moral and ethical battle of sorts over the course of some of the novel's most important events. Absalom kills and murders a man, and also meets an untimely death.\n* ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'' references the story of Absalom and King David's lament. Bean, as he sends his soldiers on a suicide mission to destroy the Buggers, says to them, \"O my son Absalom. My son, my son Absalom. Would God I could die for thee, O Absalom, my son. My sons!\"\n* The character of Absalom appears in [[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell|Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell]]''.\n* Throughout [[Robertson Davies]]'s ''[[The Manticore]]'' a comparison is repeatedly made between the protagonist's problematic relations with his father and those of between the Biblical Absalom and King David. Paradoxically, in the modern version, it is the rebellious son who has the first name \"David\". The book also introduces the term \"Absalonism\", as a generic term for a son's rebellion against his father.\n* The character of Absalom appears in [[Michael Cook (playwright)|Michael Cook]]'s ''[[The Head Guts and Sound Bone Dance]]''.\n* Absalom appears as a prominent character in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''Yonadab'', which portrays Amnon's rape of Tamar and his murder at Absalom's hands.\n* Absalom is a character in [[Michael Crummey]]'s [[Newfoundland]]-set ''Galore''.\n* Absalom's attempted coup against his father David is explored in the novel ''Zoheleth'' by J Francis Hudson (Lion Publishing 1994).\n* In ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' by [[Richard Aldington]], the narrator adapts the famous quote \"O my son Absalom. My son, my son Absalom.\" During a discussion on the nature of war as the protagonist rides the train towards the WWI front lines.\n* A scene in the Swedish writer [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s historical novel \"[[The Long Ships]]\" depicts a 10th Century Christian missionary recounting the story of Absalom's rebellion to the assembled Danish court, including the aging King [[Harald Bluetooth]] and his son [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]]; thereupon, King Harald exclaims \"Some people can learn a lesson from this story!\", casting a meaningful glance at his son Sweyn\u2014whom the King (rightly) suspects of plotting a rebellion.\n\n===Music===\n* [[Josquin des Prez]] composed the [[motet]] \"[[Absalon, fili mi]]\" on the occasion of the death of [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Juan Borgia]] (Absalon being a further alternative spelling).\n* [[Nicolas Gombert|Nicholas Gombert]] composed the two-part, eight-voice motet \"Lugebat David Absalon\".\n* [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672) composed \"Fili mi, Absalon\" as part of his [[Sinfoniae Sacrae]], op. 6.\n* The single verse, 2 Samuel 18:33, regarding David's grief at the loss of his son (\"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\"), is the inspiration for the text of several pieces of choral music, usually entitled ''[[When David Heard]]'' (such as those by Renaissance composers [[Thomas Tomkins]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]], or modern composers [[Eric Whitacre]], [[Joshua Shank]], and Norman Dinerstein). This verse is also used in \"David's Lamentation\" by [[William Billings]], first published in 1778.\n* [[Leonard Cohen]]'s poem \"Prayer for Sunset\" compares the setting sun to the raving Absalom, and asks whether another Joab will arrive tomorrow night to kill Absalom again.\n* \"Absalom, Absalom\" is a song on the 1996 Compass CD ''[[Making Light of It]]'' by singer/songwriter [[Pierce Pettis]], incorporating several elements of the biblical narrative.\n* The Australian composer [[Nigel Butterley]] set the verse in his 2008 choral work \"Beni Avshalom\", commissioned by the [[Sydney Chamber Choir]]\n* During the finale of the song \"[[Distant Early Warning (song)|Distant Early Warning]]\" by Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Geddy Lee]] sings, \"Absalom Absalom Absalom\"; lyrics written by drummer [[Neil Peart]].\n* [[David Olney]]'s 2000 CD ''[[Omar's Blues]]'' includes the song \"Absalom.\" The song depicts David grieving over the death of his son.\n* The story of Absalom is referred to several places in folk singer [[Adam Arcuragi]]'s song \"Always Almost Crying\".\n* The San Francisco-based band [[Om (band)|Om]] mentions Absalom in their song \"Kapila's Theme\" from their debut album ''[[Variations on a Theme (Om album)|Variations on a Theme]]''.\n* The garage folk band David's Doldrums references Absalom in their song, \"My Name Is Absalom\". The song alludes to Absalom's feelings of solemnity and abandonment of love and hope.\n* In \"Every Kind Word\" by [[Lackthereof]], Danny Seim's project parallel to [[Menomena]], Seim sings \"...and your hair is long like Absalom.\"\n* \"Barach Hamelech\" an Israeli song by [[Amos Etinger]] and [[Yosef Hadar]].\n* The [[grindcore]] band [[Discordance Axis]] references Absalom at the end of the track entitled \"[[Castration Rite]]\".\n* The [[Progressive Metal]] band from [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]], Absalom has his name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://karmametalcolombian.blogspot.com/2008/04/absalom-absalom-colombian-2003.html |title=Un Alma Oculto |author=Infernal North |date=8 April 2008 |publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>\n* In 2007 [[Ryland Angel]] released \"Absalom\" on Ryland Angel-Manhattan Records.\n* \"Hanging By His Hair\" from the 1998 ''[[Wormwood: Curious Stories from the Bible|Wormwood]]'' album by [[The Residents]] recounts Absalom's defiance and death.

Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} square was built within a wall about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick. An outer ''temenos'' (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was thickened about the second or [[Third dynasty of Egypt|third dynasty]]. The old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by [[Khufu (pharaoh)|Khufu]] (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=81-82}}\n\nAt an undetermined date, a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. A vase of [[Menes]] with purple [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\nThe temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]] in the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]]. He placed a great stone gateway to the temenos, an outer temenos wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about {{convert|40|x|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|eleventh dynasty]] [[Mentuhotep I]] added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, [[Mentuhotep II]] entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} square, and added subsidiary chambers. Soon thereafter in the twelfth dynasty, [[Senusret I]] laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\n=== Temple of Seti I ===\n[[File:S03 06 01 018 image 2401.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egypt \u2013 Temple of Seti I, Abydus.

Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nThe temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} A principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king Seti I, as well as reverence of the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the \"Rite of the Ancestors\". The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties\u2014recognized by Seti\u2014are carved on a wall and known as the \"[[Abydos King List]]\" (showing the [[cartouche]] name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, [[Narmer]] or [[Menes]], until his time)- with the exception of those noted above. There were significant names deliberately left out of the list. So rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, re-discovered by [[William John Bankes]], has been called the \"Rosetta Stone\" of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the [[Rosetta Stone]] for Egyptian writing, beyond the [[Narmer Palette]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Misty Cryer, \"Travellers in Egypt \u2013 William John Bankes\" (2006), TravellersinEgypt.org, web: [http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2004/10/william_john_bankes.html TravEgypt-WJB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830115640/http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2004/10/william_john_bankes.html |date=2006-08-30 }}: re-discovered Table of Abydos.</ref>\n\nThere also were seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities, being the \"state\" deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and (centrally positioned) Amun-Re; the remaining three chapels are dedicated to the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form of the Daily Ritual, which was performed throughout temples daily in Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the [[Osireion]], which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of [[Osiris]] as an \"Osiris tomb\".<ref>Caulfield, ''Temple of the Kings''</ref>  It is possible that from those chambers led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah.<ref>Murray, ''The Osireion at Abydos''</ref> The temple was originally {{convert|550|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about\n{{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, including the wing at the side.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}  Magazines for food and offerings storage were built to either side of the forecourts, as well as a small palace for the king and his retinue, to the southeast of the first forecourt (Ghazouli, The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos and the Facade of This Temple. '''ASAE''' 58 (1959)).\n\nExcept for the list of pharaohs and a [[panegyric]] on [[Ramesses II]], the subjects are not historical, but religious in nature, dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death. The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by [[Auguste Mariette]] in his ''Abydos'', I.  The temple has been partially recorded epigraphically by Amice Calverley and Myrtle Broome in their 4 volume publication of ''The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos'' (1933\u20131958).\n\n=== Ramesses II temple ===\n\nThe adjacent temple of Ramesses II was much smaller and simpler in plan; but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside that lauded his achievements, of which the lower parts remain. The outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. His list of pharaohs, similar to that of Seti I, formerly stood here; but the fragments were removed by the French consul and sold to the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\n== Tombs ==\n{{Main|Umm El Qa'ab}}\n[[File:SFEC-ABYDOS-2010-060.JPG|thumb|left|Seti I, wearing the [[Deshret]] crown of [[Lower Egypt]], with Prince Rammeses (later [[Ramesses II]]), ready to rope the [[sacred bull]] for sacrifice]]\n[[File:Pyramidion of Nesnubhotep, top of a limestone chapel monument.

Others also built before Menes are {{convert|15|x|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The probable tomb of [[Menes]] is of the latter size. Afterward the tombs increase in size and complexity. The tomb-pit is surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the [[sepulchre]] being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh surround the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the [[Asinus|asses]] found in the tomb of [[Merneith]]. Evidence of [[human sacrifice]] exists in the early tombs, such as the 118 servants in the tomb of Merneith, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.\n\nBy the end of the second dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over {{convert|3000|m2|acre|abbr=off}}, however it is possible for this to be several tombs which have met in the making of a tomb; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.<ref>Petrie, ''Royal Tombs'', i. and ii.</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\nThe cemetery of private persons began during the first dynasty with some [[pit-tomb]]s in the town. It was extensive in the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] and [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth]] dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] to [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth]] dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by [[Auguste Mariette]]'s workmen, without any record of the burials being made.<ref>Mariette, ''Abydos'', ii. and iii.</ref> Later excavations have been recorded by [[Edward R. Ayrton]], Abydos, iii.; Maclver, ''El Amrah and Abydos''; and [[Garstang]], ''El Arabah''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\n== \"Forts\" ==\nSome of the tomb structures, referred to as \"forts\" by modern researchers, lay behind the town. Known as [[Shunet ez Zebib]], it is about {{convert|450|x|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} over all, and one still stands {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. It was built by [[Khasekhemwy]], the last pharaoh of the second dynasty. Another structure nearly as large adjoined it, and probably is older than that of Khasekhemwy. A third \"fort\" of a squarer form is now occupied by a convent of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]; its age cannot be ascertained.<ref>Ayrton, Abydos, iii.</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}\n\n== Hieroglyphs in the Temple of Seti I ==\n{{Main|Helicopter hieroglyphs}}\n[[File:Hieroglif z Abydos.jpg|thumb|250px|The retouched and eroded hieroglyphs in the Temple of Seti I which are said to represent modern vehicles \u2013 a helicopter, a submarine, and a zeppelin or plane.]]\nSome of the hieroglyphs carved over an arch on the site have been interpreted in esoteric and \"ufological\" circles as depicting modern technology.\n\nThe carvings are often thought to be a helicopter, a battle tank or submarine, and a fighter plane (some interpret this as a [[U.F.O.]]) However, these conjectures are largely based in [[pseudoarchaeology]], and the picture often claimed as \"evidence\" has been retouched (see right).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catchpenny.org/abydos.html|title=Pharaoh's Helicopter?|work=catchpenny.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~A_U_R_A/abydos.html|title=\"Helicopter Hieroglyph\" Explained!|work=tripod.com}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abydos offering formula]]\n* [[Dorothy Eady]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Abydos (Egypt)|display=Abydos|volume=1|pages=81-82}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NF0LAAAAIAAJ |last=Ayrton |first=Edward Russell |author2=William Matthew Flinders Petrie |title=Abydos |volume=iii |publisher=Offices of the Egypt Exploration Fund |year=1904}}\n* {{cite journal |title=New Evidence at Abydos for Ahmose's funerary cult |last=Harvey| first=Stephen |publisher=EES |journal=Egyptian Archaeology |volume=24 |date=Spring 2004}}\n* {{cite book |last=Murray |first=Margaret Alice |author2=Joseph Grafton Milne|author3=Walter Ewing Crum |title=The Osireion at Abydos|volume=ii. and iii. |publisher=B.

Over the centuries the exact political entity to which it belonged varied. If the time of [[Augustus]] can be taken as a reference period, Abydos belonged to the [[Troad]], a subdivision of the Roman Province of [[Mysia]]. The latter then occupied the whole of the northwest corner of Asia Minor, between the [[Hellespont]] and the [[Propontis]] to the north. Abydos had the distinction of being a crossing point to Sestos at the shortest width of the Hellespont. Armies on the march crossing between Europe and Asia usually crossed there (it was not, however, the only crossing point).\n\nThe crossing therefore was highly strategic. Whoever controled it gated the traffic between the Aegean and the Black Sea and between Europe and Asia. At the beginning of Greek history that function was performed by the city of [[Troy]], then an Anatolian city. The Greeks took it from them, but the sedimentation of its harbor caused them to choose another control point, [[Byzantium]]. After the Romans conquered Greece it became [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Eastern Empire. When it fell to the Turkish conquerors of Anatolia, it became Nagara, later Nara, giving its name to [[Nara Burnu]] (Nara promontory). Constantinople was now less relevant in the defense of Turkey. Making it the showcase city of Istanbul, the Ottoman Turks placed the modern city of [[\u00c7anakkale]] ([[Turkey]]) on the downstream side of [[Nara Burnu]]. The location was still important in World War I, as the British fought a losing battle over it (the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] and the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]).\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Abydos is presented in the myth of [[Hero and Leander]] as the home of Leander.<ref>Hopkinson (2012)</ref> The city is also mentioned in ''[[Rodanthe and Dosikles]]'', a novel written by [[Theodore Prodromos]], a 12th-century Byzantine writer, in which Dosikles kidnaps Rodanthe at Abydos.<ref>Kazhdan & Wharton (1985), p. 202</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Classical period===\n[[File:Thracian chersonese.png|thumb|left|200px|The environs of Abydos in Antiquity]]\nAbydos is mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as a [[Troy|Trojan]] ally,<ref name=\"Mitchell\">Mitchell (2005)</ref> and, according to [[Strabo]], was occupied by [[Thracians]] after the [[Trojan War]].<ref name=\"Bean\">Bean (1976), p. 5</ref> Abydos was settled by [[Miletus|Milesian]] colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of [[Karabiga|Priapos]] and [[Marmara Island|Prokonnesos]] in {{circa|670 BC}}.<ref>Hansen & Nielsen (2004), p. 993</ref> Strabo related that [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], King of [[Lydia]], granted his consent to the Milesians to settle Abydos.<ref name=\"Bean\"/> Abydos was ruled by Daphnis, a pro-Persian [[tyrant]], in the 520s BC,<ref name=\"Hansen1003\">Hansen & Nielsen (2004), p. 1003</ref> but was occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 514.<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> The Persian ruler [[Darius I]] destroyed the city following his [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|Scythian campaign]] in 512.<ref name=\"Hansen1003\"/> In 480, at the onset of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], [[Xerxes I]] and the Persian army passed through Abydos on their march to Greece.<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/>\nAfter the failed Persian invasion, Abydos became a member of the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]]-led [[Delian League]],<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> and was part of the [[Members of the Delian League#Hellespontine phoros|Hellespontine district]].<ref name=\"Hansen1003\"/> Ostensibly an ally, Abydos was hostile to Athens throughout this time.<ref name=\"Bean\"/> During the [[Second Peloponnesian War]], a [[Sparta]]n expedition led by [[Dercylidas]] arrived at Abydos in early May 411 BC and successfully convinced the city to defect from the Delian League and fight against Athens,<ref>Kagan (2013), p. 102</ref> at which time he was made [[harmost]] (commander/governor) of Abydos.<ref name=\"Hodkinson \">Hodkinson (2005)</ref> Abydos was attacked by the Athenians in the winter of 409/408 BC, but was repelled by a Persian force led by [[Pharnabazus II|Pharnabazus]], [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]].<ref>Kagan (2013), p. 276</ref> Dercylidas held the office of harmost of Abydos until at least {{circa|407}}.<ref name=\"Hodkinson \" />\n\nAccording to [[Aristotle]], Abydos had an [[oligarchic]] constitution at this time.<ref name=\"Hansen1003\"/> At the beginning of the [[Corinthian War]] in 394 BC, [[Agesilaus II]], King of Sparta, passed through Abydos into Thrace.<ref name=\"Phang\"/> Abydos remained an ally of Sparta throughout the war and Dercylidas served as harmost of the city from 394 until he was replaced by [[Anaxibius]] in {{circa|390}}.

''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'', an American species locally known as black locust, is sometimes called \"false acacia\" in [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and throughout Europe.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Acacia facsiculifera seedling.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia fasciculifera]]'' seedling in the transitional stage between pinnate leaves and phyllodes]]\nThe leaves of acacias are compound [[pinnate]] in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and [[Pacific Islands]] species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as \"[[phyllode]]s\". The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], modified leaf-like [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] stems functioning as leaves.\n\nThe small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long [[stamens]], and are arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, or even purple (''Acacia purpureopetala'') or red ([[Acacia leprosa 'Scarlet Blaze'|''Acacia leprosa'' 'Scarlet Blaze']]). ''Acacia'' flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, ''[[Albizia]]'', by their stamens, which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual ''[[Mimosa]]'' flowers, those of ''Acacia'' have more than ten stamens.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurcharan|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2004|page=445|isbn=978-1-57808-351-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C}}</ref>\n\nThe plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches that have become short, hard, and pungent, though they sometimes represent leaf-[[stipule]]s. ''[[Acacia armata]]'' is the kangaroo-thorn of Australia, and ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'' (syn. ''Acacia eriolobata'') is the camelthorn of Africa.\n\nAcacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80&nbsp;\u00b0C (176&nbsp;\u00b0F)) and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around 80%.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=J Clemens |author2=PG Jones |author3=NH Gilbert |date=|year=1977|title=Effect of seed treatments on germination in Acacia|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=269\u2013276 |pmid=|doi=10.1071/BT9770269|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/65/paper/BT9770269.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Symbiosis==\n[[File:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' stipules]]\n[[File:Acacia drepanolobium MHNT.BOT.2011.3.97.jpg|thumb|Swollen stipules of ''Acacia drepanolobium'' that serve as ant [[domatia]].

At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by [[Playa Larga]] and the other on a hill known as El Guitarr\u00f3n. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\n\nLater, [[Teotihuacan]] influence made its way here via [[Cuernavaca]] and Chilpancingo. Then [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] influence arrived from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and through what is now [[Oaxaca]]. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\n\nIn the 11th century, new waves of migration of [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the [[Aztec]]s. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the [[Aztec empire]] during the reign of [[Ahuizotl]] (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named ''Tepecuacuilco''. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was on territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.<ref name=\"encmuc\" /><ref>Cabrera Guerrero, Martha Eugenia, 1990, '''Los pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos de Acapulco''', INAH, {{ISBN|968-6487-44-1}}</ref>\n\n=== 16th century ===\nThere are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\nThe first [[encomendero]] was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably [[Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte]], left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\n\n[[File:Yope Acapulco.png|right|upright=0.75|thumb|[[Codex Tudela]]: \"Acapulco's Yope Indian, at the South Sea\"]][[File:Carl Saltzmann - View of Acapulco, 1879.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2| alt=Painting of a sandy beach, sun setting behind it, seen from the water.

Lush forest is silhouetted against the late sunset. |''View of Acapulco'', 1879, oil painting by [[Carl Saltzmann]]]]Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an \"alcadia\" (major province or town).<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\n\nSpanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of [[New Spain]]. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents.<ref name=\"encmuc\" /> Acapulco would become the second most important port, after [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.<ref name=\"apiacapulco\" />\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\nThe [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon|galleon trade]] made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch [[pirates]], such as [[Francis Drake]], [[Henry Morgan]] and [[Thomas Cavendish]], who called it \"The Black Ship.\" A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The [[Fort of San Diego]] was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] began. In 1810, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]] attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos.<ref name=\"encmuc\" /> The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.\nAcapulco's importance as a port recovered during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here.  This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the [[Plan of Ayutla|Plan de Ayutla]].  After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.<ref>Fowler, Will (2007). ''Santa Anna of Mexico''. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 313. {{ISBN|9780803211209}}.</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1911, [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary forces]] took over the main plaza of Acapulco.<ref name=\"encmuc\" />\nIn 1920, the [[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of [[La Quebrada, Mexico|La Quebrada]]. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built.<ref name=\"apiacapulco\" /> In the early 1950s, President [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]] upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.\n\n[[File:Acapulco - Palmasola-Punto-mas-alto.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The Bay of Acapulco from the top of Palma Sola]]\n\nThe economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]].

It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here.<ref name=\"ambulantaje\">{{cite news |title= Combaten ambulantaje en Acapulco |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 30, 2009 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Combating wandering vendors in Acapulco }}</ref> Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work.  In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade.\n\nAnother problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.<ref name=\"limpiar\">{{cite news |title= Buscan en Guerrero limpiar fondo de mar |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 28, 2009 |page=8 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Seeking to clean the bottom of the sea in Guerrero }}</ref>  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high \"blue flag\" certifications for cleanliness and water quality.\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\nAcapulco's gastronomy is very rich, the following are typical dishes from the region:\n'''Relleno''' is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.\n'''Pozole''' is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with 'antojitos' like tostadas, tacos and tamales.  This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.\n\n=== Attractions ===\n[[File:Papagayo Park in Acapulco Mexico 1.jpg|thumb|right|Papagayo Park]]\nAcapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades.<ref name=\"nightfromm\">{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010030.html |title= Nightlife |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}</ref> Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.\nFor example, Baby \u2018O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Esc\u00e9nica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various dj\u2019s have had a performance in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, NERVO and Junkie KID.\n\nInformal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a [[bungee jump]] in this area as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/paradisebungyacaoficial/|title=Paradise  Bungy  Acapulco|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cliffdivers in La Quebrada, Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|[[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]]]]\nAnother enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the [[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]].<ref name=\"atrfromm\" /> The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below.

In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqu\u00e9s there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.<ref name=\"rutaguer\">{{cite journal |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= Quintanar Hinojosa |date=May 2007 |title= Acapulco m\u00e1s brillante de nunca |trans-title=Acapulco, more brilliant than ever |journal= Mexico Desconocido Rutas Turisticas Guerrero El destino del Mundo  |volume=135 |pages=8\u201326 |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones A\u00e9reas |location=Mexico City |issn=0188-5146 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations.<ref name=\"pursfromm\">{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010020.html |title= Active Pursuits & Acapulco Historical Museum  |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}</ref> Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing.

[[Sailfish]] are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.<ref name=\"pursfromm\" />\n\nIn the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Z\u00f3calo, lined with shade trees, caf\u00e9s and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church.<ref name=\"pursfromm\" /> Acapulco's most historic building is the [[Fort of San Diego]], located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from [[pirate]] attacks.<ref name=\"atrfromm\" /> The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000.

Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.<ref name=\"oliver\" />\n\nThere is a small museum called Casa de la M\u00e1scara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The [[Huichol people|Huichols]] and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.<ref name=\"rutaguer\" />\nThe Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pac\u00edfico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the [[Peltogyne mexicana]] or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.<ref name=\"rutaguer\" />\n\nOne cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, it takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Z\u00f3calo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city\u2019s interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.<ref>http://acapulco.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LaNao2016_Programa.pdf\n\n.

Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, in 2017 the tournament took place from the 27th of February to the 4th of March. The athletes who participated in the competition were some of the most famous players in the last couple of years, among them were Novak Djokovic currently ranked second, Rafael Nadal positioned sixth in the ranking and Marin Cilic who is the number eight in the ranking.\nThe prizes are $250,000.00 USD for WTA and $1,200,000.00 USD for ATP.<ref>http://www.abiertomexicanodetenis.com/en/\n.

In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] per person to ride, but they are not private.  The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco.  Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.\n\nThe bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider.  As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco.  The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to \"[[Hello Kitty]]\" themes.\n\nThe conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of {{convert|36.2|km|abbr=off}}, counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.<ref>[[:es:Acab\u00fas]].\n Retrieved March 12, 2017.</ref>\n\n== International relations ==\n\n=== Consulates ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:left; background:white; width:50%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!style=\"background:#810541;\"|Country\n!style=\"background:#810541;\"|Type\n!style=\"background:#810541;\"|Ref.\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''Canada'''\n|Consular agency\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66:25&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''United States'''\n|Consular agency\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84:44&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''The Russian Federation'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87:47&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''Finland'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89:49&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''France'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90:50&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''Philippines'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=88:48&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''Poland'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=133:99&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''Spain'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83:43&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|'''United Kingdom'''\n|Honorary consul\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/acreditadas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=135:172&catid=35|title=Secretar\u00eda de Relaciones Exteriores - Gobierno - gob.mx|website=www.sre.gob.mx}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Pending transboundary nominations==\n[[File:Manilajf9742 16.JPG|thumb|The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Memorial at Plaza Mexico in Intramuros, Manila]]\n\nIn 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO.\n\nAn Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (UST) on April 23, 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List.

So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade. And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/20673320 |title=Interview with Alan Kay on education |work=The Generational Divide |publisher=The Davis Group |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nOriginally from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Kay's family relocated several times due to his father's career in [[physiology]] before ultimately settling in the [[New York metropolitan area]] when he was nine.\n\nHe attended the prestigious [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], where he was suspended due to insubordination in his senior year. Having already accumulated enough credits to graduate, Kay then attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in [[Bethany, West Virginia]]. He majored in [[biology]] and minored in [[mathematics]] before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institution's Jewish quota.\n\nThereafter, Kay taught guitar in [[Denver, Colorado]] for a year and hastily enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status. Assigned as a [[computer programmer]] (a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era) after passing an aptitude test, he devised an early cross-platform file transfer system.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Kay enrolled at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics and [[molecular biology]] in 1966. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist. During his studies at CU, he wrote the music for an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and other campus theatricals.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn the autumn of 1966, he began graduate school at the [[University of Utah]] [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. He earned an [[M.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1968 before taking his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science in 1969. His doctoral dissertation, ''FLEX: A Flexible Extendable Language'', described the invention of a [[computer language]] known as [[Flex (language)|FLEX]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan C.

This greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]] research, he ended his musical career.\n\nIn 1968, he met [[Seymour Papert]] and learned of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[programming language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] optimized for [[education]]al purposes. This led him to learn of the work of [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], and of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist learning]], further influencing his professional orientation.\n\nLeaving Utah as an [[associate professor]] of computer science in 1969, Kay became a visiting researcher at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] in anticipation of accepting a professorship at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Instead, in 1970, he joined the [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|PARC]] research staff in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Throughout the decade, he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in their [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] computers.\n\nKay is one of the fathers of the idea of [[object-oriented programming]], which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC. Some of the original object-oriented concepts, including the use of the words 'object' and 'class', had been developed for Simula 67 at the [[Norwegian Computing Center]]. Later he said:\n\n<blockquote>I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term \"objects\" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the  lesser idea. The big idea is \"messaging\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html|title= AlanKayOnMessaging}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile at PARC, Kay conceived the [[Dynabook]] concept, a key progenitor of [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers and the [[e-book]]. He is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bergin, Jr. |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Gibson, Jr. |first2=Richard G. |place=New York, NY |year=1996 |publisher=ACM Press, Addison-Wesley |title=History of Programming Languages II |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=234286}}</ref> Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into [[mobile learning]]; many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the [[One Laptop Per Child]] educational platform, with which Kay is actively involved.\n\nThe field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to Kay, in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]], but a medium in the [[Marshall McLuhan]] sense. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As with Simulas leading to OOP, this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be. Not a personal dynamic vehicle, as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM \"railroads\", but something much more profound: a personal dynamic medium. With a vehicle one could wait until high school and give \"drivers ed\", but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html|title=The Early History of Smalltalk|website=gagne.homedns.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Recent work and recognition ==\nFrom 1981 to 1984, Kay was [[Atari]]'s Chief Scientist. He became an Apple Fellow in 1984. Following the closure of the company's [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]] in 1997,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/438-alan-kay.html?start=1 |title=Alan Kay |date=13 November 2009 |work=I Programmer}}</ref> he was recruited by his friend [[Bran Ferren]], head of research and development at [[Disney]], to join [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a Disney Fellow. He remained there until Ferren left to start Applied Minds Inc with Imagineer [[Danny Hillis]], leading to the cessation of the Fellows program. In 2001, he founded [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.  For its first ten years, Kay and his Viewpoints group were based at [[Applied Minds]] in [[Glendale, California]], where he and Ferren continued to work together on various projects. Kay was also a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.\n\nKay taught a Fall 2011 class, \"Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World\", at [[New York University]]'s [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger. The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kay |first=Alan |title=Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World |url=https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseInfo.php?course_id=489 |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet ===\nIn December 1995, while still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the [[open source]] [[Squeak]] version of [[Smalltalk]], and he continues to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] system. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], [[Andreas Raab]], Rick McGeer, [[Julian Lombardi]] and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet Project]], an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.\n\n=== Tweak ===\nIn 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. [[Andreas Raab]] was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a \"script process\" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012532/http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title=Events, Scripts & Multiple Processes |author=[[Andreas Raab]] |date=6 July 2001 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]] added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title= Tweak: Whitepapers}}</ref> Its underlying object system is [[Class (computer programming)|class-based]], but to users (during programming) it acts like it is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.\n\n=== Children's Machine ===\nIn November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the [[One Laptop per Child]] program, the Children's Machine, and the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]]. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend, [[Nicholas Negroponte]], and is based on Kay's [[Dynabook]] ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.\n\n=== Reinventing programming ===\nKay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled \"The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet\" were informed by his experiences with [[Sketchpad]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], and the bloated code of commercial software.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, Kay's proposal to the United States [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) was granted, thus funding [[Viewpoints Research Institute]] for several years. The proposal title was: ''STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming'': A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|title=Steps Toward The Reinvention of Programming \u2013 A Compact And Practical Model of Personal Computing As A Self-Exploratorium|author1=Alan Kay|author2=Dan Ingalls|author3=Yoshiki Ohshima|author4=Ian Piumarta|author5=[[Andreas Raab]]|access-date=2013-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508090431/http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}} Proposal to NSF \u2013 Granted on August 31st 2006</ref> A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: \"The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days.

Such explicit procedures are called algorithms or ''programs''. Because an effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic structure, it is called a ''programming language''.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis notation was used inside IBM for short research reports on computer systems, such as the [[Burroughs B5000]] and its stack mechanism when [[stack machine]]s versus [[register machine]]s were being evaluated by IBM for upcoming computers.\n\nIverson also used his notation in a draft of the chapter ''A Programming Language'', written for a book he was writing with [[Fred Brooks]], ''Automatic Data Processing'', which would be published in 1963.<ref>Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/apl/book/Iverson-AutomaticDataProcessing-color.pdf/view \"Automatic Data Processing: Chapter 6: A programming language\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604091847/http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/apl/book/Iverson-AutomaticDataProcessing-color.pdf/view |date=June 4, 2009}}, 1960, Draft copy for Brooks and Iverson 1963 book, ''Automatic Data Processing''.</ref><ref>[[Fred Brooks|Brooks, Fred]]; Iverson, Kenneth, (1963), ''Automatic Data Processing'', John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Iverson received the [[Turing Award]] for his work on APL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=9147499&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING |title=Turing Award Citation 1979 |publisher=Awards.acm.org |access-date=February 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223064709/http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=9147499&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING |archive-date=2009-12-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Development into a computer programming language ===\nAs early as 1962, the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after Falkoff discussed with William C. Carter his work to standardize the instruction set for the machines that later became the [[IBM System/360]] family.\n\nIn 1963, Herbert Hellerman, working at the IBM Systems Research Institute, implemented a part of the notation on an [[IBM 1620]] computer, and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation. Students tested their code in Hellerman's lab. This implementation of a part of the notation was called Personalized Array Translator (PAT).<ref>Hellerman, H., \"Experimental Personalized Array Translator System\", ''Communications of the ACM'', 7, 433 (July, 1964).</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Falkoff, Iverson, and [[Edward H. Sussenguth Jr.]], all working at IBM, used the notation for a formal description of the [[IBM System/360]] series machine architecture and functionality, which resulted in a paper published in ''[[IBM Systems Journal]]'' in 1964. After this was published, the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system. One of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of John L. Lawrence who had new duties with [[Science Research Associates]], an educational company bought by IBM in 1964. Lawrence asked Iverson and his group to help use the language as a tool to develop and use computers in education.<ref>Falkoff, Adin D.; Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APLEvol.htm \"The Evolution of APL\"], ACM SIGPLAN Notices 13, 1978-08.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Lawrence M. Breed]] and [[Philip S. Abrams]] of Stanford University joined the team at IBM Research, they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in [[FORTRAN IV]] for a part of the notation which had been done for the [[IBM 7090]] computer running on the [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS|IBSYS]] operating system. This work was finished in late 1965 and later named IVSYS (for Iverson system). The basis of this implementation was described in detail by Abrams in a Stanford University Technical Report, \"An Interpreter for Iverson Notation\" in 1966, the academic aspect of this was formally supervised by [[Niklaus Wirth]].<ref>Abrams, Philip S., [http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR/CS-TR-66-47.html ''An interpreter for \"Iverson notation\"''], Technical Report: CS-TR-66-47, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, August 1966;</ref> Like Hellerman's PAT system earlier, this implementation did not include the APL character set but used special English reserved words for functions and operators. The system was later adapted for a [[time-sharing]] system and, by November 1966, it had been reprogrammed for the [[IBM System/360 Model 50]] computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at IBM.<ref>Haigh, Thomas, \"Biographies: Kenneth E. Iverson\", ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', 2005</ref>\n\n=== Hardware ===\n[[File:IBM Selectric Globe Wiki.jpg|thumb|IBM typeballs (one OCR) with clip, {{\u20ac|2}} coin for scale]]\n\n[[File:APL-keybd2.svg|thumb|A programmer's view of the IBM 2741 keyboard layout with the APL typing element print head inserted]]\n\nA key development in the ability to use APL effectively, before the wide use of cathode ray tube ([[Computer monitor#Cathode ray tube|CRT]]) terminals, was the development of a special [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] interchangeable typing element with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typing element mechanism, such as the [[IBM 1050]] and [[IBM 2741]] terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could type in and see proper APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typing elements, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them.<ref name=\"APLQQ91\">Breed, Larry, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=138094.140933 \"The First APL Terminal Session\"], ''APL Quote Quad'', Association for Computing Machinery, Volume 22, Number 1, September 1991, p.2-4.</ref> Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typing element for the APL character set.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/?setdate=December 19, 2009 Adin Falkoff] \u2013 Computer History Museum. \"Iverson credited him for choosing the name APL and the introduction of the IBM golf-ball typewriter with the replacement typehead, which provided the famous character set to represent programs.\"</ref>\n\nMany APL symbols, even with the APL characters on the Selectric typing element, still had to be typed in by over-striking two extant element characters. An example is the ''grade up'' character, which had to be made from a ''delta'' (shift-H) and a ''[[Sheffer stroke]]'' (shift-M). This was necessary because the APL character set was much larger than the 88 characters allowed on the typing element, even when letters were restricted to upper-case (capitals).\n\n=== Commercial availability ===\nThe first APL interactive login and creation of an APL workspace was in 1966 by Larry Breed using an IBM 1050 terminal at the IBM Mohansic Labs near [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]], the home of APL, in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]].<ref name=\"APLQQ91\"/>\n\nIBM was chiefly responsible for introducing APL to the marketplace. APL was first available in 1967 for the [[IBM 1130]] as ''APL\\1130''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.vector.org.uk/archive/v223/APL_1130.htm |title=How We Got to APL\\1130 |last=Breed |first=Larry |author-link=Larry Breed |journal=Vector (British APL Association) |volume=22 |issue=3 |date=August 2006 |issn=0955-1433}}</ref><ref>[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/1130/lang/1130-03.3.001_APL_1130_May69.pdf APL\\1130 Manual], May 1969</ref> It would run in as little as 8k 16-bit words of memory, and used a dedicated 1 megabyte hard disk.\n\nAPL gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, in part because it would support multiple users on lower-specification systems that had no [[Memory management unit|dynamic address translation]] hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/aplint.htm |title=Remembering APL |publisher=Quadibloc.com |date= |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref> Additional improvements in performance for selected [[IBM System/370]] mainframe systems included the ''APL Assist Microcode'' in which some support for APL execution was included in the processor's [[firmware]], as distinct from being implemented entirely by higher-level software. Somewhat later, as suitably performing hardware was finally growing available in the mid- to late-1980s, many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment.\n\nEarly IBM APL interpreters for IBM 360 and IBM 370 hardware implemented their own multi-user management instead of relying on the host services, thus they were their own timesharing systems. First introduced in 1966, the ''APL\\360''<ref name=\"IBM APL\\360 1968\">Falkoff, Adin; Iverson, Kenneth E., [http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/apl/APL_360_Users_Manual_Aug68.pdf \"APL\\360 Users Guide\"], IBM Research, Thomas J.

The ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged \"I-beam\" functions, using both [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] and [[Dyadics|dyadic]] operations.<ref>Falkoff, Adin D.; Iverson, Kenneth E.,[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/174/ibmrd1704F.pdf ''The Design of APL''], ''IBM Journal of Research and Development'', Volume 17, Number 4, July 1973. \"These environmental defined functions were based on the use of still another class of functions\u2014called \"I-beams\" because of the shape of the symbol used for them\u2014which provide a more general facility for communication between APL programs and the less abstract parts of the system. The I-beam functions were first introduced by the system programmers to allow them to execute System/360 instructions from within APL programs, and thus use APL as a direct aid in their programming activity. The obvious convenience of functions of this kind, which appeared to be part of the language, led to the introduction of the monadic I-beam function for direct use by anyone. Various arguments to this function yielded information about the environment such as available space and time of day.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1973, IBM released ''APL.SV'', which was a continuation of the same product, but which offered [[shared variable]]s as a means to access facilities outside of the APL system, such as operating system files. In the mid-1970s, the IBM mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the [[IBM 5100]] desktop computer, which had a small CRT and an APL keyboard, when most other small computers of the time only offered [[BASIC]]. In the 1980s, the ''VSAPL'' program product enjoyed wide use with [[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS), [[Time Sharing Option]] (TSO), [[VSPC]], [[MUSIC/SP]], and [[CICS]] users.\n\nIn 1973-1974, Patrick E. Hagerty directed the implementation of the University of Maryland APL interpreter for the 1100 line of the Sperry [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series]] mainframe computers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Minker |first=Jack |title=Beginning of Computing and Computer Sciences at the University of Maryland |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/department/dept-history/minker-report.pdf |publisher=University of Maryland |access-date=May 23, 2011 |location=Section 2.3.4 |page=38 |format=PDF |date=January 2004 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610064807/http://www.cs.umd.edu/department/dept-history/minker-report.pdf |archive-date= June 10, 2011}}</ref> At the time, Sperry had nothing.

In North America, the better-known ones were [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], [[Scientific Time Sharing Corporation]] (STSC), Time Sharing Resources (TSR), and [[The Computer Company]] (TCC). CompuServe also entered the market in 1978 with an APL Interpreter based on a modified version of Digital Equipment Corp and Carnegie Mellon's, which ran on DEC's KI and KL 36-bit machines. CompuServe's APL was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service.  With the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the [[IBM 4300]], and later the personal computer, by the mid-1980s, the timesharing industry was all but gone.\n\n''Sharp APL'' was available from [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], first as a timesharing service in the 1960s, and later as a program product starting around 1979. ''Sharp APL'' was an advanced APL implementation with many language extensions, such as ''packages'' (the ability to put one or more objects into a single variable), file system, nested arrays, and [[shared variable]]s.\n\nAPL interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini-computer manufacturers also, notably [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC), [[Data General]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC), [[Harris Corporation|Harris]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Siemens AG]], [[Xerox]], and others.\n\nGarth Foster of [[Syracuse University]] sponsored regular meetings of the APL implementers' community at Syracuse's Minnowbrook Conference Center in [[Blue Mountain Lake, New York]]. In later years, Eugene McDonnell organized similar meetings at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds]] near Monterey, California, and at Pajaro Dunes near Watsonville, California.

Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting that there is some weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the 1960s and 1970s, few terminal devices and even display monitors could reproduce the APL character set. The most popular ones employed the [[IBM Selectric]] print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL [[Computer terminal|line terminals]] (line-mode operation only, ''not'' full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Texas Instruments |title=TI 745 full page ad: Introducing a New Set of Characters |journal=Computerworld|date=1977 |volume=11 |issue=27 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wMe6erbb5V4C&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=apl+terminal+%22texas+instruments%22&q=apl%20terminal%20%22texas%20instruments%22 |access-date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> which featured [[Duplex (telecommunications)|half and full duplex]] [[telecommunication]]s modes, for interacting with an APL [[time-sharing]] service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, [[Remote job entry|called an RJE]].\n\nOver time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic displays, printing devices and [[Unicode]] support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated.

All primitives are defined to have the same [[operator precedence|precedence]], and always associate to the right. Thus, APL is ''read'' or best understood from [[APL syntax and symbols#Syntax rules|right-to-left]].\n\nEarly APL implementations (circa 1970 or so) had no programming loop-[[control flow|flow control]] structures, such as <code>do</code> or <code>while</code> loops, and <code>if-then-else</code> constructs. Instead, they used array operations, and use of [[structured programming]] constructs was often not necessary, since an operation could be performed on a full array in one statement. For example, the <code>iota</code> function (<code>\u03b9</code>) can replace for-loop [[iteration]]: \u03b9N when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one-dimensional array (vector), 1 2 3 ... N. More recent implementations of APL generally include comprehensive control structures, so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated.\n\nThe APL environment is called a ''workspace''. In a workspace the user can define programs and data, i.e., the data values exist also outside the programs, and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Workspace|title=The Workspace|url=http://www.microapl.co.uk/apl/apl_concepts_chapter2.html|website=www.microapl.co.uk|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> In the examples below, the APL interpreter first types six spaces before awaiting the user's input.

Recall that mathematical expressions are not read or evaluated from right-to-left.\n|}\n\nThe user can save the workspace with all values, programs, and execution status.\n\nAPL is well known for its use of a set of non-[[ASCII]] symbols, which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation. Having single character names for single instruction, multiple data ([[SIMD]]) vector functions is one way that APL enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing [[Conway's Game of Life]] in one line of code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catpad.net/michael/apl |title=example |publisher=Catpad.net |date= |access-date=June 17, 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708114840/http://catpad.net/michael/apl/ |archive-date=July 8, 2013 |df=}}</ref> In nearly all versions of APL, it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression, that is, in one line of code.\n\nBecause of the unusual [[character set]], many programmers use special [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] with APL keytops to write APL code.<ref>{{cite web|last1=APL Symbols|title=Entering APL Symbols|url=http://www.microapl.co.uk/apl/introduction_chapter2.html|website=www.microapl.co.uk|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Although there are various ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters,<ref>[http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/apl_archives/apl/translit.schemes Dickey, Lee, A list of APL Transliteration Schemes], 1993</ref> in practice it is almost never done. (This may be thought to support Iverson's thesis about [[Linguistic relativity|notation as a tool of thought]].<ref>Iverson K.E.,\n\"[http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm Notation as a Tool of Thought]\", ''Communications of the ACM'', 23: 444-465 (August 1980).</ref>) Most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts, with special mappings or [[input method editor]]s to access non-ASCII characters. Historically, the APL font has been distinctive, with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols. Most vendors continue to display the APL character set in a custom font.\n\nAdvocates of APL{{Who|date=March 2015}} claim that the examples of so-called ''write-only code'' (badly written and almost incomprehensible code) are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes, which can occur in any language. Advocates also claim that they are far more productive with APL than with more conventional computer languages, and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology.\n\nThey also may claim that because it is compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger-scale software development and complexity, because the number of lines of code can be reduced greatly. Many APL advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as [[COBOL]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] as being comparatively tedious. APL is often found where time-to-market is important, such as with trading systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Batenburg |title=APL Efficiency |url=http://www.ekevanbatenburg.nl/PRVAPL.HTML |website=www.ekevanbatenburg.nl |access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Vaxman |title=APL Great Programming |url=http://www.vaxman.de/publications/apl_slides.pdf |website=www.vaxman.de |access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Janko |first=Wolfgang |title=Investigation into the efficiency of using APL for the programming of an inference machine |journal=ACM Digital Library |date=May 1987 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=450\u2013456 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=28372 |access-date=January 1, 2015 |doi=10.1145/384282.28372}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Borealis |title=Why APL? |url=http://www.aplborealis.com/whyapl.html |website=www.aplborealis.com |access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminology ===\nAPL makes a clear distinction between ''functions'' and ''operators''.<ref name=\"MicroAOL_Operators\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Iverson |first=Kenneth E. |author-link=Kenneth E.

Operators (similar to [[higher-order function]]s) take functions or arrays as arguments, and derive related functions. For example, the ''sum'' function is derived by applying the ''reduction'' operator to the ''addition'' function. Applying the same reduction operator to the ''maximum'' function (which returns the larger of two numbers) derives a function which returns the largest of a group (vector) of numbers. In the J language, Iverson substituted the terms ''verb'' for ''function'' and ''adverb'' or ''conjunction'' for ''operator''.\n\nAPL also identifies those features built into the language, and represented by a symbol, or a fixed combination of symbols, as ''primitives''. Most primitives are either functions or operators. Coding APL is largely a process of writing non-primitive functions and (in some versions of APL) operators. However a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators, most noticeably assignment.\n\nSome words used in APL literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Sharp Associates |access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\n==== Hello, World ====\nThis displays \"[[Hello, world]]\":\n\n<source lang=\"apl\">\n'Hello, world'\n</source>\n'Hello World,' sample user session on YouTube<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dyalog APL/W|title=Producing a standalone 'Hello World' program in APL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8HGPJhHSRY|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Dyalog-APLtrainer|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA design theme in APL is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages.\n\nThe 'Hello, world' string constant above displays, because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly (e.g. assignment, function parameter).\n\n==== Exponentiation ====\nAnother example of this theme is that exponentiation in APL is written as \"{{code|2\u22c63}}\", which indicates raising 2 to the power 3 (this would be written as \"{{code|2^3}}\" in some other languages and \"{{code|2**3}}\" in FORTRAN and Python). However, if no base is specified (as with the statement \"{{code|\u22c63}}\" in APL, or \"{{code|^3}}\" in other languages), most other programming languages one would have a syntax error. APL however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] (2.71828....), and so interpreting \"{{code|\u22c63}}\" as \"{{code|2.71828\u22c63}}\".\n\n====Simple statistics====\nSuppose that {{code|X}} is an array of numbers. Then {{code|(+/X)\u00f7\u2374X}} gives its average. Reading ''right-to-left'', {{code|\u2374X}} gives the number of elements in X, and since {{code|\u00f7}} is a dyadic operator, the term to its left is required as well. It is in parenthesis since otherwise X would be taken (so that the summation would be of {{code|X\u00f7\u2374X}}, of each element of X divided by the number of elements in X), and {{code|+/X}} adds all the elements of X. Building on this, {{code|((+/((X - (+/X)\u00f7\u2374X)*2))\u00f7\u2374X)*0.5}} calculates the standard deviation. Further, since assignment is an operator, it can appear within an expression, so \n {{code|SD\u2190((+/((X - AV\u2190(T\u2190+/X)\u00f7\u2374X)*2))\u00f7\u2374X)*0.5}}\nwould place suitable values into T, AV and SD. Naturally, one would make this expression into a function for repeated use rather than retyping it each time.\n\n==== ''Pick 6'' lottery numbers ====\nThis following immediate-mode expression generates a typical set of ''Pick 6'' [[lottery]] numbers: six [[pseudo-random]] [[integer]]s ranging from 1 to 40, ''guaranteed non-repeating'', and displays them sorted in ascending order:\n\n<source lang=\"apl\">\nx[\u234bx\u21906?40]\n</source>\n\nThe above does a lot, concisely; although it seems complex to a new [[wiktionary:APLer|APLer]]. It combines the following APL ''functions'' (also called ''primitives''<ref>{{cite web|last1=MicroAPL|title=APL Primitives|url=http://www.microapl.co.uk/apl_help/ch_020_020.htm|website=www.microapl.co.uk|publisher=MicroAPL|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref> and ''glyphs''<ref>{{cite web|last1=NARS2000|title=APL Font \u2013 Extra APL Glyphs|url=http://wiki.nars2000.org/index.php/APL_Font|website=wiki.nars2000.org|publisher=NARS2000|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref>):\n* The first to be executed (APL executes from rightmost to leftmost) is dyadic function <code>?</code> (named <code>deal</code> when dyadic) that returns a [[array data structure|vector]] consisting of a select number (left argument: 6 in this case) of random integers ranging from 1 to a specified maximum (right argument: 40 in this case), which, if said maximum \u2265 vector length, is guaranteed to be non-repeating; thus, generate/create 6 random integers ranging from 1-40.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Ralph L.|title=Systematically Random Numbers|url=http://www.sigapl.org/article1.php|website=www.sigapl.org|publisher=SIGAPL|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref>\n* This vector is then ''assigned'' (<code>\u2190</code>) to the variable <code>x</code>, because it is needed later.\n* This vector is then ''sorted'' in ascending order by a monadic <code>\u234b</code> function, which has as its right argument everything to the right of it up to the next unbalanced ''close-bracket'' or close-parenthesis. The result of <code>\u234b</code> is the indices that will put its argument into ascending order.\n* Then the output of <code>\u234b</code> is used to index the variable <code>x</code>, which we saved earlier for this purpose, thereby selecting its items in ''ascending'' sequence.\n\nSince there is no function to the left of the left-most x to tell APL what to do with the result, it simply outputs it to the display (on a single line, separated by spaces) without needing any explicit instruction to do that.\n\n<code>?</code> also has a monadic equivalent called <code>roll</code>, which simply returns one random integer between 1 and its sole operand [to the right of it], inclusive. Thus, a [[role-playing game]] program might use the expression <code>?20</code> to roll a twenty-sided die.\n\n==== Prime numbers ====\nThe following expression finds all [[prime number]]s from 1 to R.

ALGOL-W was based on the proposal for the next generation ALGOL, but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced, rather than a cleaned, simplified ALGOL 60.\n\nALGOL 68 is substantially different from ALGOL 60 and was not well received, so that in general \"Algol\" means ALGOL 60 and dialects thereof.\n\n==Important implementations==\nThe [[ALGOL 58|International Algebraic Language]] (IAL), or ALGOL 58, was extremely influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages (the so-called Algol-like languages). Additionally, '''ALGOL object code''' was a simple, compact, and stack-based [[instruction set|instruction set architecture]] commonly used in teaching [[compiler]] construction and other high order languages (of which Algol is generally considered the first).\n\n==History==\nALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at [[ETH Zurich]] (cf. [[ALGOL 58]]). It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs periods) for different languages.\n\nALGOL was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than [[Burroughs Corporation]]. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.\n\n[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus\u2013Naur form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald E. | year=1964 | title=Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=7 | issue=12 | pages=735\u2013736 | doi = 10.1145/355588.365140 }}</ref>\n\nPeter Naur: \"As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959.

One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.\"\n\nALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[Tony Hoare]] remarked: \"Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.\"<ref>[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf \"Hints on Programming Language Design\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915033339/http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf |date=15 September 2009 }}, C.A.R.

Reynolds's idealized Algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call-by-name languages, to be contrasted with the global effects used by call-by-value languages such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] and ML.<ref>[[Peter O'Hearn]] and [[Robert D.

The latter is still used for Unisys MCP system software.\n\n==Properties==\nALGOL 60 as officially defined had no [[I/O]] facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (input/output) facilities.\n\nALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common [[call-by-value]], and [[call-by-name]]. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to [[call-by-reference]]. For example, without specifying the parameters as ''value'' or ''reference'', it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.<ref>{{cite book | last=Aho | first=Alfred V. | authorlink=Alfred V. Aho | author2=Ravi Sethi | author2-link=Ravi Sethi |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman |author3-link=Jeffrey Ullman | title=[[Dragon Book (computer science)|Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] | year=1986 | edition=1st | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=0-201-10194-7}}, Section 7.5, and references therein</ref> Think of passing a pointer to swap(i, A[i]) in to a function. Now that every time swap is referenced, it is reevaluated. Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.\n\nCall-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting \"[[Thunk (delayed computation)|thunk]]s\" that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the \"[[man or boy test]]\" to separate compilers that correctly implemented \"[[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] and non-local references.\" This test contains an example of call-by-name.\n\nALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]] and which bears his name. [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s use a [[context-free grammar]] to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled \"semantics\" and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as ''ad hoc'' code attached to the formal language parser.\n\n==Examples and portability issues==\n\n===Code sample comparisons===\n\n====ALGOL 60====\n(The way the bold text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' -- quotation marks included -- for '''integer'''.

The code lacked any quote characters so \u00a3 (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. \u00a3\u00a3L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).\n\n   HIFOLKS'\n   BEGIN\n      PRINT \u00a3HELLO WORLD\u00a3L??'\n   END'\n\nThe [[ICT 1900 series]] Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card.  Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case.  Output was to a line printer.

It is a standard feature of most [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s.\n\nThe AWK language is a [[data-driven programming|data-driven]] [[scripting language]] consisting of a set of actions to be taken against [[Stream (computing)|streams]] of textual data \u2013 either run directly on files or used as part of a [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] \u2013 for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the [[string (computer science)|string]] [[datatype]], [[associative array]]s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and [[regular expression]]s. While AWK has a limited intended [[application domain]] and was especially designed to support [[one-liner program]]s, the language is [[Turing-complete]], and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch08s02.html#awk\n| title       = Applying Minilanguages\n| first       = Eric S.\n| last        = Raymond\n| authorlink  = Eric S.

When written in all lowercase letters, as <code>awk</code>, it refers to the [[Unix]] or [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] program that runs scripts written in the AWK programming language.\n\n==History==\nAWK was initially developed in 1977 by [[Alfred Aho]], [[Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]], from whose initials the language takes its name. As one of the early tools to appear in [[Version 7 Unix]], AWK added computational features to a Unix [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] besides the [[Bourne shell]], the only scripting language available in a standard Unix environment. It is one of the mandatory utilities of the [[Single UNIX Specification]],<ref>[http://www.unix.org/version3/apis/cu.html The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3, Utilities Interface Table]</ref> and is required by the [[Linux Standard Base]] specification.<ref>[http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/command.html#AEN32008 Linux Standard Base Core Specification 4.0, Chapter 15.

Both were designed for text processing. They share the line-oriented, data-driven paradigm, and are particularly suited to writing [[one-liner program]]s, due to the implicit [[main loop]] and current line variables. The power and terseness of early AWK programs \u2013 notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables, which facilitate one-liners \u2013 together with the limitations of AWK at the time, were important inspirations for the [[Perl]] language (1987). In the 1990s, Perl became very popular, competing with AWK in the niche of Unix text-processing languages.\n\n== Structure of AWK programs ==\n\n<blockquote>\n\"'''AWK''' is a language for processing text files. A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. '''An AWK program is a sequence of pattern-action statements'''. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.\" - Alfred V. Aho<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1726534212;pp;2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808234125/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B1726534212%3Bpp%3B2 |archivedate=2008-08-08 |df= }} The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAn AWK program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as:\n\n<source lang=\"awk\">\ncondition { action }\ncondition { action }\n...\n</source>\n\nwhere ''condition'' is typically an expression and ''action'' is a series of commands. The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn, and executes the ''action'' for each expression that is true. Either the ''condition'' or the ''action'' may be omitted. The ''condition'' defaults to matching every record. The default ''action'' is to print the record. This is the same pattern-action structure as sed.\n\nIn addition to a simple AWK expression, such as <code>foo == 1</code> or <code>/^foo/</code>, the ''condition'' can be <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> causing the ''action'' to be executed before or after all records have been read, or ''pattern1, pattern2'' which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches ''pattern1'' up to and including the record that matches ''pattern2'' before again trying to match against ''pattern1'' on future lines.\n\nIn addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, <code>~</code>, which matches a [[regular expression]] against a string. As handy [[syntactic sugar]], ''/regexp/'' without using the tilde operator matches against the current record; this syntax derives from [[sed]], which in turn inherited it from the [[Ed (text editor)|ed]] editor,  where <code>/</code> is used for searching. This syntax of using slashes as [[delimiter]]s for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by Perl and ECMAScript, and is now quite common. The tilde operator was also adopted by Perl, but has not seen as wide use.\n\n== Commands ==\n\nAWK commands are the statements that are substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions.\n\n=== The ''print'' command ===\n\nThe ''print'' command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:\n\n; <code>print</code>\n:This displays the contents of the current record. In AWK, records are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately:\n; <code>print $1</code>\n: Displays the first field of the current record\n; <code>print $1, $3</code>\n: Displays the first and third fields of the current record, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character\n\nAlthough these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in [[Perl]]), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands \"<code>print</code>\" and \"<code>print $0</code>\" are identical in functionality.\n\nThe ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print 3+2\n   print foobar(3)\n   print foobar(variable)\n   print sin(3-2)\n}\n</source>\n\nOutput may be sent to a file:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print \"expression\" > \"file name\"\n}\n</source>\n\nor through a [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print \"expression\" | \"command\"\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Built-in variables ===\n\nAwk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.\n\nOther variables include:\n* <code>NR</code>: Keeps a current count of the number of input records.\n* <code>NF</code>: Keeps a count of the number of fields in an input record. The last field in the input record can be designated by $NF.\n* <code>FILENAME</code>: Contains the name of the current input-file.\n* <code>FS</code>: Contains the \"field separator\" character used to divide fields on the input record. The default, \"white space\", includes any space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character to change the field separator.\n* <code>RS</code>: Stores the current \"record separator\" character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a \"newline\".\n* <code>OFS</code>: Stores the \"output field separator\", which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a \"space\" character.\n* <code>ORS</code>: Stores the \"output record separator\", which separates the output records when Awk prints them. The default is a \"newline\" character.\n* <code>OFMT</code>: Stores the format for numeric output. The default format is \"%.6g\".\n\n=== Variables and syntax ===\n\nVariable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string [[concatenation]], simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between. Double quotes [[delimit]] string constants. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line.\n\n=== User-defined functions ===\n\nIn a format similar to [[C (programming language)|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword <code>function</code>, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function.\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nfunction add_three (number) {\n    return number + 3\n}\n</source>\n\nThis statement can be invoked as follows:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n(pattern)\n{\n   print add_three(36)     # Outputs '''39'''\n}\n</source>\n\nFunctions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the argument list before the local variables, to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin.\n\n== Sample applications ==\n\n=== Hello World ===\n\nHere is the customary \"[[\"Hello, World!\" program|Hello, world]]\" program written in AWK:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN { print \"Hello, world!\" }\n</source>\n\nNote that an explicit <code>exit</code> statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is <code>BEGIN</code>, no command-line arguments are processed.\n\n=== Print lines longer than 80 characters ===\n\nPrint all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nlength($0) > 80\n</source>\n\n=== Print a count of words ===\n\nCount words in the input and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like [[wc (Unix)|wc]]):\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n{\n    w += NF\n    c += length + 1\n}\nEND { print NR, w, c }\n</source>\n\nAs there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default, so the increment actions are executed for every line. Note that <code>w += NF</code> is shorthand for <code>w = w + NF</code>.\n\n=== Sum last word ===\n\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n{ s += $NF }\nEND { print s + 0 }\n</source>\n\n''s'' is incremented by the numeric value of ''$NF'', which is the last word on the line as defined by AWK's field separator (by default, white-space). ''NF'' is the number of fields in the current line, e.g. 4. Since ''$4'' is the value of the fourth field, ''$NF'' is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest [[operator precedence]]. (If the line has no fields, then ''NF'' is 0, ''$0'' is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0.)\n\nAt the end of the input the ''END'' pattern matches, so ''s'' is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to ''s'', it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. ''s \"\"''.  Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints \"0\" on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed.\n\n=== Match a range of input lines ===\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nNR % 4 == 1, NR % 4 == 3 { printf \"%6d  %s\\n\", NR, $0 }\n</source>\nThe action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C [[printf]] and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: ''NR'' is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. ''%'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo]] operator. ''NR % 4 == 1'' is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input. Likewise, ''NR % 4 == 3'' is true for the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5.\n\nThus, the program prints lines 1,2,3, skips line 4, and then 5,6,7, and so on. For each line, it prints the line number (on a 6 character-wide field) and then the line contents. For example, when executed on this input:\n Rome\n Florence\n Milan\n Naples\n Turin\n Venice\n\nThe previous program prints:\n      1 Rome\n      2 Florence\n      3 Milan\n      5 Turin\n      6 Venice\n\n==== Printing the initial or the final part of a file ====\nAs a special case, when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true, e.g. ''1'', the range will start at the beginning of the input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. ''0'', the range will continue until the end of input. For example,\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n /^--cut here--$/, 0\n</source>\nprints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ''^--cut here--$'', that is, a line containing only the phrase \"--cut here--\", to the end.\n\n=== Calculate word frequencies ===\n\n[[Word frequency]] using [[associative array]]s:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN {\n    FS=\"[^a-zA-Z]+\"\n}\n{\n    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++)\n          words[tolower($i)]++\n}\nEND {\n    for (i in words)\n         print i, words[i]\n}\n</source>\n\nThe BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line\n for (i in words)\ncreates a loop that goes through the array ''words'', setting ''i'' to each ''subscript'' of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each ''value'' in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count. <code>tolower</code> was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published.\n\n=== Match pattern from command line ===\n\nThis program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the [[Bourne shell]] to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\npattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '/'\"$pattern\"'/ { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nThe <code>$pattern</code> in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces.  A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line (<code>$0</code>) matches. <code>FILENAME</code> contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them. <code>$0</code> expands to the original unchanged input line.\n\nThere are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexport pattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '$0 ~ ENVIRON[\"pattern\"] { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nThis is a shell script that uses <code>ENVIRON</code>, an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of <code>ENVIRON</code> is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the [[getenv]] function in various standard libraries and [[POSIX]]. The shell script makes an environment variable <code>pattern</code> containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.\n\n<code>~</code> checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand; <code>!~</code> is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables.\n\nThe next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\npattern=\"$1\"\nshift\nawk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }' \"pattern=$pattern\" \"$@\"\n</source>\n\nOr You can use the ''-v var=value'' command line option (e.g. ''awk -v pattern=\"$pattern\" ...'').\n\nFinally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\nBEGIN {\n    pattern = ARGV[1]\n    for (i = 1; i < ARGC; i++) # remove first argument\n        ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1]\n    ARGC--\n    if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book)\n        ARGC = 2\n        ARGV[1] = \"-\"\n    }\n}\n$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME \":\" $0 }\n</source>\n\nThe <code>BEGIN</code> is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the <code>BEGIN</code> block ends. <code>ARGC</code>, the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be \u22651, as <code>ARGV[0]</code> is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string <code>\"awk\"</code>. Also note that <code>ARGV[ARGC]</code> is the empty string, <code>\"\"</code>. <code>#</code> initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line.\n\nNote the <code>if</code> block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that\n awk 'prog'\nonly works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before <code>prog</code> is run! If you explicitly set <code>ARGC</code> to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename <code>-</code>.\n\n== Self-contained AWK scripts ==\n\nOn Unix-like operating systems self-contained AWK scripts can be constructed using the [[shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax.\n\nFor example, a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named <code>print.awk</code> with the following content:\n<source lang=\"awk\">\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n{ print $0 }\n</source>\n\nIt can be invoked with: <code>./print.awk <filename></code>\n\nThe <code>-f</code> tells AWK that the argument that follows is the file to read the AWK program from, which is the same flag that is used in sed. Since they are often used for one-liners, both these programs default to executing a program given as a command-line argument, rather than a separate file.\n\n== Versions and implementations ==\n\nAWK was originally written in 1977 and distributed with [[Version 7 Unix]].\n\nIn 1985 its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book ''The AWK Programming Language'', published 1988, and its implementation was made available in releases of [[UNIX System V]]. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes called \"new awk\" or ''nawk''. This implementation was released under a [[free software license]] in 1996 and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan (see external links below).\n                           \nOld versions of Unix, such as [[UNIX/32V]], included <code>awkcc</code>, which converted AWK to C. Kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into C++; its state is not known.<ref>[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc++.ps An AWK to C++ Translator]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410003418/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc%2B%2B.ps |date=April 10, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n* '''BWK awk''', also known as '''nawk''', refers to the version by [[Brian Kernighan]].

Asgard is composed of 12 realms including Valhalla, [[\u00der\u00fa\u00f0heimr|Thrudheim]], [[Breidablik]] that are ruled by Odin, [[Thor]] and [[Baldr]] respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Asgard|title=Asgard {{!}} Norse mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\nThe [[Prose Edda]] presents two views regarding Asgard.\n\n====''Prologue''====\nIn the ''Prologue'' Snorri offers a [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] and Christian-influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his forefathers. Asgard, he conjectures, is the home of the \u00c6sir (singular \u00c1s) in As-ia, making a [[folk etymology|folk etymological]] connection between the three \"As-\"; that is, the \u00c6sir were \"men of Asia\", not gods, who moved from Asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there. Snorri's interpretation of the 13th century foreshadows 20th-century views of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] migration from the east.\n\nSnorri further writes that Asgard is a land more fertile than any other, blessed also with a great abundance of gold and jewels. Correspondingly, the \u00c6sir excelled beyond all other people in strength, beauty and talent.\n\nSnorri proposes the location of Asgard as [[Troy]], the center of the earth. About it were 12 kingdoms and 12 chiefs. One of them, M\u00fan\u00f3n, married [[Priam]]'s daughter, Tr\u00f3\u00e1n, and had by her a son, Tr\u00f3r, pronounced [[Thor]] in [[Old Norse]]. The latter was raised in [[Thrace]]. At age 12 he was whiter than ivory, had hair lighter than gold, and could lift 10 bear skins at once. He explored far and wide. His father, Odin, led a migration to the northern lands, where they took wives and had many children, populating the entire north with Aesir. One of the sons of Odin was [[Yngvi]], founder of the [[Ynglingar]], an early royal family of [[Sweden]]. These accounts were written 200  years after the Christianization of Iceland.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/Research/Uni-Nova/Uni-Nova-124/Uni-Nova-124-Old-Norse-topographies.html|title=From Troy to Scandinavia \u2013 Old Norse topographies|website=www.unibas.ch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref>\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\n[[File:Odin and his brothers create the world.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the creation of the world by [[Odin]], [[Vili and V\u00e9]]. Illustration by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]].]]\nIn ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Snorri presents the mythological version, taken no doubt from his sources. Icelanders were still being converted at that time. He could not present the myths as part of any current belief. Instead he resorts to a debunking device: Gylfi, king of Sweden before the \u00c6sir, travels to Asgard and finds there a large hall ([[Valhalla]]) in Section 2.\n\nWithin are three officials (three Aesir Kings), whom Gylfi in the guise of Gangleri is allowed to question about the Asgard and the \u00c6sir. A revelation of the ancient myths follows, but at the end the palace and the people disappear in a clap of thunder and Gylfi finds himself alone on the plain, having been deluded (Section 59).\n\nIn Gylfi's delusion, ancient Asgard was ruled by the senior god, the all-father, who had twelve names. He was the ruler of everything and the creator of heaven and earth (Section 3). During a complex creation myth in which the cosmic cow [[Au\u00f0umbla|Audhumbla]] licked [[B\u00fari]] free from the ice, the sons of Buri's son, [[Borr|Bor]], who were [[Odin]], [[Vili and V\u00e9]], constructed the universe and put [[Midgard]] in it as a residence for the first human couple, [[Ask and Embla]], whom they created from driftwood trees in Section 9.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sons of Bor then constructed Asgard (to be identified with Troy, Snorri insists in section 9) as a home for the \u00c6sir, who were divinities. Odin is identified as the all-father. Asgard is conceived as being on the earth. A rainbow bridge, [[Bifr\u00f6st]],  connects it to heaven (Section 13). In Asgard also is a temple for the 12 gods, [[Gladsheim]], and another for the 12 goddesses, [[Ving\u00f3lf]]. The plain of [[Idavoll]] is the centre of Asgard (Section 14).\n\nThe gods hold court there every day at the [[Wyrd|Well of Urd]], beneath an ash tree, [[Yggdrasil]], debating the fates of men and gods. The more immediate destinies of men are assigned by the [[Norns]] (Section 15). It also states Thor is a god as well.\n\nLong descriptions of the gods follow. Among the more memorable details are the [[Valkyries]], the battle maidens whom Odin sends to allot death or victory to soldiers. Section 37 names 13 Valkyries and states that the source as the Poetic Edda poem ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]''. Odin's residence is [[Valhalla]], to which he takes those slain in battle, the [[Einherjar]] (Section 20). Snorri quips: \"There is a huge crowd there, and there will be many more still ....\" (Section 39). They amuse themselves every day by fighting each other and then going to drink in the big hall.\n\nToward the end of the chapter Snorri becomes prophetic, describing [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], the twilight of the gods. It will begin with three winters of snow, with no summers in between. Wars will follow, then earthquakes and tidal waves. The sky will split open and out will ride the sons of [[Muspell]] intent on universal destruction. They will try to enter heaven but Bifr\u00f6st will break (Section 55). [[Heimdall]] will blow his mighty horn Gj\u00f6ll and the \u00c6sir and Einherjar will ride out to battle. Most of the \u00c6sir will die and Asgard be destroyed. Snorri quotes his own source saying: \"The sun will go black, earth sink in the sea, heaven be stripped of its bright stars;....\" (Section 56).\n\nAfterwards, the earth rises again from the sea, is fairer than before, and where Asgard used to be a remnant of the \u00c6sir gather, some coming up from [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and talk and play chess all day with the golden chessmen of the ancient \u00c6sir, which they find in the grass (Section 58).\n\n====''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l''====\nThe 10th century Skald [[\u00deorbj\u00f6rn d\u00edsarsk\u00e1ld]] is quoted in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' as stating:\n<blockquote>\nThor has defended Asgard and [[List of names of Odin|Ygg's]] [Odin's] people [the gods] with strength.<ref name=LINDOW/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Heimskringla''===\n\n====''Ynglinga Saga''====\nBy the time of the ''[[Ynglinga Saga]]'', Snorri had developed his concept of Asgard further, although the differences might be accounted for by his sources. In the initial stanzas of the poem Asagarth is the capital of Asaland, a section of Asia to the east of the Tana-kv\u00edsl or Vana-Kv\u00edsl river (kv\u00edsl is \"fork\"), which Snorri explains is the [[Tanais]], or [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], flowing into the [[Black Sea]]. The river divides \"Sweden the Great\", a concession to the [[Viking]] point of view. It is never called that prior to the Vikings (Section 1).\n\nThe river lands are occupied by the [[Vanir]] and are called Vanaland or Vanaheim. It is unclear what people Snorri thinks the Vanes are, whether the proto-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Venedi]] or the east Germanic [[Vandals]], who had been in that region at that time for well over 1000 years. He does not say; however, the Germanic names of the characters, such as Njord, Frey and Vanlandi, indicate he had the Vandals in mind.\n\nOdin is the chief of Asagarth. From there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world. He has the virtue of never losing a battle (Section 2). When he is away, his two brothers, [[Vili and V\u00e9]], rule Asaland from Asagarth.\n\nOn the border of Sweden is a mountain range running from northeast to southwest. South of it are the lands of the Turks, where Odin had possessions; thus, the mountains must be the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. On the north are the uninhabitable fells, which must be the tundra/taiga country. Apparently the Vikings did not encounter the [[Urals]] or the [[Uralic peoples|Uralics]] of the region. Snorri evidences no knowledge of them.\n\nThere also is no mention of [[Troy]], which was not far from [[Constantinople]], capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and militarily beyond the reach of the Vikings. Troy cannot have been Asagarth, Snorri realizes, the reason being that the \u00c6sir in Asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the Romans; that is, of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nAs a result, Odin led a section of the \u00c6sir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle. They used the Viking route up the Don and the [[Volga]] through [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]], Viking [[Russia]]. From there they went to Saxland (Germany) and to the lands of [[Gylfi]] in [[Scandinavia]] (Section 5). The historical view is mainly fantastical. The Germanics were in Germany and Scandinavia during earliest mention of them in Roman literature, long before the Romans had conquered even Italy. To what extent Snorri's presentation is poetic creation only remains unclear.\n\nDemoted from his position as all-father, or king of the gods, Odin becomes a great sorcerer in the Ynglinga Saga. He can shape-shift, speaks only in verse, and lies so well that everything he says seems true. He strikes enemies blind and deaf but when his own men fight they go  [[Berserker|berserk]] and cannot be harmed. He has a ship that can be rolled up like a tablecloth when not used, he relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence, and he consults the talking head of [[Mimir]] for advice (Section 7).\n\nAs a man, however, Odin is faced with the necessity to die.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man [[Project Mercury]] which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-man [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin stands on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', an iconic image from the 1968 [[Apollo 8]] mission, taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first manned flight in 1968. It achieved its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the Service Module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three manned missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final [[Apollo 17]] mission marked the sixth [[Moon landing]] and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[Human spaceflight|manned spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three astronauts. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual manned [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s. The program was named after the [[Apollo|Greek god of light, music, and the sun]] by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said that \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]]. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"[[missile gap]]\" that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher A. |last=Preble |title=\"Who Ever Believed in the 'Missile Gap'?\": John F.

At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''Command/Service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command/Service Module===\n{{main|Apollo Command/Service Module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped Command Module, attached to the cylindrical Service Module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the Scientific Instrument Module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=George M. |authorlink=George Low |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |lccn=75600071 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=Testing and Retesting To Get Ready For flight |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-4-6.html}}</ref>\n\nThis was followed on April 4, 1968, by [[Apollo 6]] (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n===Manned development missions===\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo manned development mission patches.

This would keep the program on track. The [[Soviet Union]] had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard [[Zond 5]], and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.<ref name=\"Chaikin\">{{cite book |last=Chaikin |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Chaikin |title=[[A Man on the Moon]]: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts |date=1994 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=978-0-670-81446-6 |lccn=93048680 |ref=Chaikin}}</ref><ref name=\"Moon Race 1968\">{{cite news |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 |location=New York}}</ref> The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"life boat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.

Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. \n\nTraditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as \"assault\". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.\n\nLegal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Related definitions==\n\n===Battery===\nIn jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act<ref>An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet & Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.</ref> (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.<ref>A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.</ref> Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.\n\n===Aggravated assault===\n[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}</ref> A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:\n* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon<ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet & Maxwell|chapter=9}}</ref>\n* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent\n* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''\n\nAggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.\n\n==Defenses==\nAlthough the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:\n\n===Consent===\nExceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.\n\n[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.<ref>(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M.

Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.\n\n===Punishment===\nIn some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.\n\nIn the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes \"reasonable\" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].\n\nMany countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].\n\n===Prevention of crime===\nThis may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.\n\n===Defense of property===\nSome jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.\n\nThis defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Regional details==\n\n===Canada===\nAssault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].<ref name=1985-46>{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}</ref> There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to \"tap\", \"pinch\", \"push\", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.\n\nThe potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/> This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.\n\nSome variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:\n\n* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.<ref name=1985-46/>\n* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].\n\nAn individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.\n\n===India===\nThe Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,<ref>{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}</ref> sections 351 through 358.\n{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - \"Indian Penal Code\"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Code further explains that \"mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault\". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350).

Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms \"assault\" and \"common assault\" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].\n\nA [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.\n\n=====Aggravated assaults=====\nAn assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing \"actual bodily harm\" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, \"[[grievous bodily harm]]\" (GBH).\n;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].\n;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as \"malicious wounding\" or \"unlawful wounding\". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as \"wounding with intent\". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n\nOther aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:\n;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].\n;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].\n;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].\n;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].\n;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:\n:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or\n:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].\n;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.\n;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).\n;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).\n;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].\n;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].\n;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.\n;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.\n\n====Scotland====\nIn [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an \"attack upon the person of another\".<ref>MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155</ref> There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''<ref>1987 SCCR 534</ref> wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:\n\n{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}\n\nScottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply \"evil intent\",<ref>MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30</ref> although this has been held to mean no more than that assault \"cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently\" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a \"hold-up\" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.\n\nIt is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nSeveral offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:\n* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;\n* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43\n* Common assault: under section 47\n* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47\nThe [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:\n* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.\n\nThat Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.<ref>{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nEach state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State.

The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.\n\nAs the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.\n\nLaws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:\n* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another \n* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing bodily harm by reckless operation of a [[motor vehicle]] (vehicular assault).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.522|title=RCW 46.61.522: Vehicular assault  \u2014  Penalty.|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* threatening another in a menacing manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2006/s28index/s2803010000.html|title=\u00a7 28-310 \u2014 Assault in the third degree; penalty. :: Chapter 28 \u2014 Crimes and Punishments: 2006 Nebraska Revised Statutes :: Nebraska Revised Statutes: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia|work=Justia Law|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* knowingly causing physical contact with another person knowing the other person will regard the contact as offensive or provocative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C500-599/5650000070.HTM|title=Section 565-070  Until December 31, 2016--Assault in the|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>\n* causing stupor, unconsciousness or physical injury by intentionally administering a drug or controlled substance without consent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2005/title53a/sec53a-60.html|title=Sec. 53a-60.

In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.\n\nFurthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].\n\nSome possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:\n* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.\n* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nAssault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, \"hubris\" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.\n\nViolations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.<ref>MacDowell (1976) p. 25.</ref> Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.\n\nHubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, \"outrageous treatment\", in general.\n\nThe meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an \"act of hubris\", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[At\u00eb]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.\n\nCrucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (tim\u0113) and shame. The concept of tim\u0113 included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of \"insolence, contempt, and excessive violence\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affray]]\n* [[Assault (tort)]]\n* [[Battery (crime)]]\n* [[Common assault]]\n* [[Domestic violence]]\n* [[Gay bashing]]\n* [[Hate crime]]\n* [[Mayhem (crime)|Mayhem]]\n* [[Misdemeanor]]\n* [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]\n* [[Rape]]\n* [[Sexual assault]]\n* [[Street fighting]]\n* [[Terroristic threat]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet & Maxwell}} chapter 9\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|beat up}}\n{{Wiktionary|assault}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151414/http://criminallawonline.com/artassaults.php A guide to the non fatal offences against the person]\n* [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c108:5:./temp/~c1082ah2oE:: H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212] Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004\n* [http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php IPC Chapter XVI] (Mobile Friendly)\n\n[[Category:Assault| ]]\n[[Category:Crimes]]\n[[Category:Violence]]", "sha1": "bwxrxyvohrgve3far33ss8y6v69bdqm"}}, {"title": "Australian Prime Ministers", "ns": "0", "id": "1476", "redirect": {"title": "Prime Minister of Australia"}, "revision": {"id": "298235986", "parentid": "298233515", "timestamp": "2009-06-24T00:22:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Malcolmxl5", "id": "4076676"}, "comment": "[[WP:UNDO|Undid]] revision 298233515 by [[Special:Contributions/72.82.193.235|72.82.193.235]] ([[User talk:72.82.193.235|talk]]). rv.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Prime Minister of Australia]]", "sha1": "bs8oktxyjyg3u78mq9gcqdm4sq8cfkd"}}, {"title": "\u00c1lfheimr", "ns": "0", "id": "1478", "revision": {"id": "849733507", "parentid": "847755829", "timestamp": "2018-07-11T00:11:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Harizotoh9", "id": "15428987"}, "comment": "Video game and pop culture trivia.

The pair are attested in both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] gods, one of whom is [[Odin]], find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Ask and Embla by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Ask and Embla (1919) by Robert Engels.]]\n[[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|askr}} literally means \"[[fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]]\" but the [[etymology]] of ''embla'' is uncertain, and two possibilities of the meaning of ''embla'' are generally proposed. The first meaning, \"[[Ulmus glabra|elm tree]]\", is problematic, and is reached by deriving ''*Elm-la'' from ''*Almil\u014dn'' and subsequently to {{lang|non|almr}} (\"elm\").<ref name=SIMEK74>Simek (2007:74).</ref> The second suggestion is \"[[vine]]\", which is reached through ''*Ambil\u014d'', which may be related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] term {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|\u00e1mpelos}}), itself meaning \"vine, [[liana]]\".<ref name=SIMEK74>Simek (2007:74).</ref> The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.\n\nAccording to [[Benjamin Thorpe]] \"[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as [[Mashya and Mashyana|Meshia and Meshiane]], the [[Iranian religion|ancient Persian]] names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees.\"<ref name=THORPE337>Thorpe (1907:337).</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\nIn stanza 17 of the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'', the [[v\u00f6lva]] reciting the Poem states that [[H\u0153nir]], [[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]] and [[Odin]] once found Ask and Embla on Land.

Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in [[Scandinavia]] has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a [[The King's Grave|Bronze Age grave in Kivik]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=SIMEK74/>\n\n[[Jaan Puhvel]] comments that \"ancient myths teem with trite 'first couples' of the type of [[Adam and Eve|Adam and his by-product Eve]]. In Indo-European tradition, these range from the Vedic Yama and Yam\u012b and the Iranian Ma\u0161ya and Ma\u0161y\u0101nag to the Icelandic Askr and Embla, with trees or rocks as preferred raw material, and [[dragon]]'s teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure\".<ref name=\"PUHVEL-284\">Puhvel (1989 [1987]:284).</ref>\n\nIn his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in Indo-European society, Anders Hultg\u00e5rd observes that \"myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient Europe and Indo-Europe and Indo-European-speaking peoples of Asia Minor and Iran. By contrast the cultures of the Near East show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man's origin from clay, earth or blood by means of a divine creation act\".<ref name=\"HULTGAARD-62\">Hultg\u00e5rd (2006:62).</ref>\n\n===Other potential Germanic analogues===\nTwo wooden figures\u2014the [[Braak Bog Figures]]\u2014of \"more than human height\" were unearthed from a [[peat bog]] at [[Braak]] in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], [[Germany]]. The figures depict a nude male and a nude female. [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] comments that these figures may represent a \"Lord and Lady\" of the [[Vanir]], a group of Norse gods, and that \"another memory of [these wooden deities] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore\".<ref name=\"DAVIDSON-88-89\">Davidson (1975:88\u201489).</ref>\n\nA figure named [[Oisc of Kent|\u00c6sc]] ([[Old English language|Old English]] \"ash tree\") appears as the son of [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengest]] in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] genealogy for the kings of [[Kent]]. This has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse [[Germanic mythology]].<ref name=ORCHARD8>Orchard (1997:8).</ref>\n\nConnections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the [[Vandals|Vandal]] kings Assi and Ambri, attested in [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 7th century AD work ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]''.

Woodcut. Wellcome V0000079.jpg|thumbnail|Alanus ab Insulis (Alain de Lille).]]\n'''Alain de Lille''' (Latin: ''Alanus ab Insulis''; {{circa}} 1128{{snd}}1202/03) was a French theologian and poet. He was born in [[Lille]], some time before 1128. His exact date of death remains unclear as well, with most research pointing toward it being between 14 April 1202, and 5 April 1203.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zott|first=Lynn|title=Classical and Medieval Literature Criticism|year=2003|publisher=Gale|location=Farmington Hills}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\nLittle is known of his life, however it is clear that Alan entered the schools no earlier than the late 1140s; first attending the school at Paris, and then at [[Chartres]]. He probably studied under masters such as [[Peter Abelard]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], and [[Thierry of Chartres]]. This is known through the writings of [[John of Salisbury]], who is thought to have been a near exact contemporary student of Alan of Lille.<ref name=\"auto1\" >{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.R.|title=Alan of Lille: The Frontiers of Theology in the Later Twelfth Century|year=1983|publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref> His earliest writings were probably written in the 1150s, and probably in Paris.<ref name=\"auto2\" >{{cite book|last=Marenbon|first=John|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Education|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell}}</ref> Alan spent many years teaching at the school in Paris and he attended the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] in 1179. Though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach, he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in Paris, and taught there, as well as some time in southern France, into his old age. He afterwards inhabited [[Montpellier]] (he is sometimes called '''Alanus de Montepessulano'''), lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister, and finally retired to [[C\u00eeteaux]], where he died in 1202.{{sfn|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911}}\n\nHe had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge, more varied than profound, caused him to be called ''Doctor Universalis''. Many of Alan's writings are unable to be exactly dated, and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well. However, it does seem clear that his first notable work, ''[[Summa Quoniam Homines]]'', was completed somewhere between 1155 and 1165, with the most conclusive date being 1160, and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in Paris.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the [[Latin literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]]; one of these, the ''De planctu naturae'', is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity.  He created the allegory of grammatical \"conjugation\" which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages.  The ''Anticlaudianus'', a treatise on morals as [[Medieval allegory|allegory]], the form of which recalls the pamphlet of Claudian against Rufinus, is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity.{{sfn|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911}}\n\n==Theology and philosophy==\n\nAs a theologian Alain de Lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]].  His [[mysticism]], however, is far from being as absolute as that of the [[Victorines]].  In the ''Anticlaudianus'' he sums up as follows: Reason, guided by prudence, can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order; for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith.  This rule is completed in his treatise, ''Ars catholicae fidei'', as follows: Theology itself may be demonstrated by reason.  Alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle, and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the [[Creed]].  This bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal, and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection ([[axiom]], [[theorem]], [[corollary]], etc.) that gives his treatise its apparent originality.{{sfn|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911}}\n\nAlan's philosophy was a sort of mixture of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy. The Platonist seemed to outweigh the Aristotelian in Alan, but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much Aristotelian logic combined with [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] mathematics.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n==Works and attributions==\nOne of Alan's most notable works was one he modeled after [[Boethius]]\u2019 ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', to which he gave the title ''[[De Planctu Naturae]]'', or ''The Plaint of Nature'', and which was most likely written in the late 1160s.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> In this work, Alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of God.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> He also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity, through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality, has defiled itself from nature and God. In ''[[Anticlaudianus]]'', another of his notable works, Alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man. She has only the ability to create a soulless body, and thus she is \"persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul,\" and \"the Seven Liberal Arts produce a chariot for her... the Five Senses are the horses\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=James J.|title=Introduction to The Plaint of Nature|year=1980|publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto}}</ref> The ''Anticlaudianus'' was translated into French and German in the following century, and toward 1280 was re-worked into a musical anthology by [[Adam de la Bass\u00e9e]].<ref>A. J. Creighton, ''Anticlaudien: A Thirteenth-Century French Adaptation'' (Washington: 1944).</ref><ref>Andrew Hughes, \"The ''Ludus super Anticlaudianum'' of Adam de la Bass\u00e9e\". ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' 23\"1 (1970), 1\u201325.</ref> One of Alan's most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching, ''[[Ars Praedicandi]]'', or ''The Art of Preaching''. This work shows how Alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be \"used as a practical manual\" when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.R.|title=Introduction to The Art of Preaching|year=1981|publisher=Cistercian Publications|location=Kalamazoo}}</ref>\n\nAlan wrote three very large theological textbooks, one being his first work, ''[[Summa Quoniam Homines]]''. Another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus, is his ''[[De Fide Catholica]]'', dated somewhere between 1185 and 1200, Alan sets out to refute heretical views, specifically that of the [[Waldensians]] and [[Cathars]].<ref name=\"auto2\" /> In his third theological textbook, ''[[Regulae Caelestis Iuris]]'', he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules; this was typical of the followers of [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], of which Alan could be associated.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> Other than these theological textbooks, and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry, Alan of Lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects, primarily including [[Speculative Theology]], [[Theoretical Moral Theology]], [[Practical Moral Theology]], and various collections of poems.\n\nAlain de Lille has often been confounded with other persons named Alain, in particular with another Alanus ([[Alain, bishop of Auxerre]]), Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury, Alain de Podio, etc.  Certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him, as well as some of their works: thus the ''Life of St Bernard'' should be ascribed to Alain of Auxerre and the ''Commentary upon Merlin'' to [[Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury|Alan of Tewkesbury]].  Alan of Lille was not the author of a ''Memoriale rerum difficilium'', published under his name, nor of ''[[Moralium dogma philosophorum]]'', nor of the satirical ''[[Apocalypse of Golias]]'' once attributed to him; and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the ''Dicta Alani de lapide philosophico'' really issued from his pen.  On the other hand, it now seems practically demonstrated that Alain de Lille was the author of the ''Ars catholicae fidei'' and the treatise ''Contra haereticos''.{{sfn|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911}}\n\nIn his sermons on capital sins, Alain argued that [[sodomy]] and homicide are the most serious sins, since they call forth the wrath of God, which led to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. His chief work on penance, the ''Liber poenitenitalis'' dedicated to [[Henry de Sully]], exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]. Alain's identification of the sins against nature included [[bestiality]], [[masturbation]], oral and anal intercourse, [[incest]], [[adultery]] and rape. In addition to his battle against moral decay, Alan wrote a work against [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and Christian heretics dedicated to William VIII of [[Montpellier]].\n\n==List of known works==\n*''[[De Planctu Naturae]]''\n*''[[Anticlaudianus]]''\n*''[[Rhythmus de Incarnatione et de Septem Artibus]]''\n*''[[De Miseria Mundi]]''\n*''[[Quaestiones Alani Textes]]''\n*''[[Summa Quoniam Homines]]''\n*''[[Regulae Theologicae]]''\n*''[[Hierarchia Alani]]''\n*''[[De Fide Catholica: Contra Haereticos, Valdenses, Iudaeos et Paganos]]''\n*''[[De Virtutibus, de Vitiis, de Donis Spiritus Sancti]]''\n*''[[Liber Parabolarum]]''\n*''[[Distinctiones Dictionum Theologicalium]]''\n*''[[Elucidatio in Cantica Canticorum]]''\n*''[[Glosatura super Cantica]]''\n*''[[Expositio of the Pater Noster]]''\n*''[[Expositiones of the Nicene and Apostolic Creeds]]''\n*''[[Expositio Prosae de Angelis]]''\n*''[[Quod non-est celebrandum bis in die]]''\n*''[[Liber Poenitentialis]]''\n*''[[De Sex Alis Cherubim]]''\n*''[[Ars Praedicandi]]''\n*''[[Sermones]]''<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n'''Attribution:'''\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Alain de Lille|volume=1|pages=467\u2013468|first=Paul Daniel |last=Alphand\u00e9ry}}\n\n==Translations==\n*Alan of Lille, ''A Concise Explanation of the Song of Songs in Praise of the Virgin Mary'', trans Denys Turner, in Denys Turner, ''Eros and Allegory: Medieval Exegesis of the Song of Songs'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Cistercian Publications, 1995), 291\u2013308\n*''The Plaint of Nature'', translated by James J Sheridan, (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1980)\n*''Anticlaudian: Prologue, Argument and Nine Books'', edited by W.H, Cornog, (Philadelphia, 1935)\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dynes, Wayne R.

Mentioned as still [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] allies of the [[Germanic Christianity|Christian]] Franks, the Alemanni were gradually Christianized during the seventh century. The {{lang|la|[[Lex Alamannorum]]|italic=yes}} is a record of their customary law during this period. Until the eighth century, Frankish [[suzerainty]] over Alemannia was mostly nominal. After an uprising by [[Theudebald, Duke of Alamannia]], though, [[Carloman I|Carloman]] executed the Alamannic nobility and installed Frankish dukes. \nDuring the later and weaker years of the [[Carolingian Empire]], the Alemannic counts became almost independent, and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the [[Bishopric of Constance]]. The chief family in Alamannia was that of the counts of {{lang|la|[[Raetia Curiensis]]|italic=yes}}, who were sometimes called margraves, and one of whom, [[Burchard II, Duke of Swabia|Burchard II]], established the [[Duchy of Swabia]], which was recognized by [[Henry the Fowler]] in 919 and became a [[stem duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe area settled by the Alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where [[Alemannic German]] dialects remain spoken, including German [[Swabia]] and [[Baden]], French [[Alsace]], [[German-speaking Switzerland]], and Austrian [[Vorarlberg]]. \n\nThe [[French language]] [[names of Germany|name of Germany]], {{lang|fr|Allemagne}}, is derived from their name, from [[Old French]] ''aleman(t)'',<ref>recorded as ''aleman'' in c. 1100, and with final dental, ''alemant'' or ''alemand'', from c. 1160.

At that time, they apparently dwelt in the basin of the [[Main River|Main]], to the south of the Chatti.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Cassius Dio]] portrays the Alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html | publisher=University of Chicago | title=Cassius Dio: Roman History}}</ref> They had asked for his help, according to Dio, but instead he colonized their country, changed their place names, and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid. When he became ill, the Alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him. Caracalla, it was claimed, tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits.\n\nIn retribution, Caracalla then led the [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II ''Traiana Fortis'']] against the Alemanni, who lost and were pacified for a time. The legion was as a result honored with the name ''Germanica.\" The fourth-century fictional [[Historia Augusta]], ''Life of Antoninus Caracalla'', relates (10.5) that Caracalla then assumed the name ''Alemannicus,\"at which Helvius Pertinax jested that he should really be called ''Geticus Maximus,\" because in the year before he had murdered his brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html | publisher=University of Chicago | title=Historia Augusta: The Life of Antoninus Caracalla}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of his short reign, Caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations. If he had any reasons of state for such actions, they remained unknown to his contemporaries. Whether or not the Alemanni had been previously neutral, they were certainly further influenced by Caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of Rome.\n\nThis mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the Roman writers persisted in calling the Alemanni ''barbari,\" meaning \"savages.\" The archaeology, however, shows that they were largely Romanized, lived in Roman-style houses and used Roman artifacts, the Alemannic women having adopted the Roman fashion of the ''[[tunic]]a'' even earlier than the men.\n\nMost of the Alemanni were probably at the time, in fact, resident in or close to the borders of [[Germania Superior]]. Although Dio is the earliest writer to mention them, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] used the name to refer to Germans on the [[Limes Germanicus]] in the time of [[Trajan]]'s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed, around 98-99 AD. At that time, the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time. Trees from the earliest fortifications found in [[Germania Inferior]] are dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 99-100 AD.\n\nAmmianus relates ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060211084122/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/fld/CLASSICS/ammianus17.html xvii.1.11]) that much later the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] undertook a [[punitive expedition]] against the Alemanni, who by then were in Alsace, and crossed the Main (Latin ''Menus''), entering the forest, where the trails were blocked by felled trees. As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a\n\"fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alemanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name\".<ref>''munimentum quod in Alamannorum solo conditum Traianus suo nomine voluit appellari.''</ref>\n\nIn this context, the use of Alemanni is possibly an anachronism, but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alemanni of Caracalla's campaigns.\n\n===Alemanni and Hermunduri===\nThe early detailed source, the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of Tacitus, has sometimes been interpreted in such a way as to provide yet other historical problems. In [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm Chapter 42]  the [[Hermunduri]] were a tribe certainly located in the region that later became [[Thuringia]]. Tacitus stated that they traded with [[Rhaetia]], which in Ptolemy is located across the Danube from [[Germania Superior]]. A logical conclusion to draw is that the Hermunduri extended over later [[Swabia]] and therefore the Alemanni originally derived from the Hermunduri.\n\nHowever, no Hermunduri appear in Ptolemy, though after the time of Ptolemy, the Hermunduri joined with the [[Marcomanni]] in the wars of 166\u2013180 against the empire. A careful reading of Tacitus provides one solution. He says that the source of the [[Elbe]] is among the Hermunduri, somewhat to the east of the upper [[Main (river)|Main]]. He places them also between the [[Naristi]] (Varisti), whose location at the very edge of the ancient [[Black Forest]] is well known, and the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]]. Moreover, the Hermunduri were broken in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] and made a separate peace with Rome. The Alemanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present in the mix of peoples at that time that became Alemannian.\n\n===Ptolemy's ''Geography''===\nBefore the mention of Alemanni in the time of Caracalla, one would search in vain for Alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius [[Ptolemy]], written in Greek in the mid-second century;  at that time, the people who later used that name likely were known by other designations.<ref>Ptolemy's description has some limitations. Upper Germany and Lower Germany are mentioned by name, but only as specific districts of Gallia Belgica (2.8), the border between them was an unidentified river, the Obruncus. The region is repeated again under Germany, but this time he does not list Roman boundaries. Germania Superior, the Agri Decumates and the limes are not to be found there, though they certainly existed at the time. \"Germania Magna\" is found within the Rhine, Danube, Vistula and shores of the \"Oceanus Germanicus\". Most of the tribes are missing or listed without name. The Main is not there, nor is Lake Constance. The Danube runs from the Alps. The Rhine does not bend to the south next to Swabia. Ptolemy's Germania is like a surreal image of itself, accurate only if certain known lines are followed, but the overall shape is greatly distorted.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy. Germania Superior is easily identified. Following up the Rhine one comes to a town, Mattiacum, which must be at the border of the Roman Germany (vicinity of [[Wiesbaden]]). Upstream from it and between the Rhine and [[Abnoba]] (in the [[Black Forest]]) are the [[Ingriones]], [[Intuergi]], [[Vangiones]], [[Caritni]] and [[Vispi]], some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before. On the other side of the northern Black Forest were the Chatti about where [[Hesse]] is today, on the lower Main.\n\nHistoric Swabia was eventually replaced by today's [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval [[Alamannia]], comprising all Germania Superior and territory east to Bavaria. It did not include the upper Main, but that is where Caracalla campaigned. Moreover, the territory of Germania Superior was not originally included among the Alemanni's possessions.\n\nHowever, if one looks for the peoples in the region from the upper Main in the north, south to the Danube and east to the [[Czech Republic]] where the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] were located, Ptolemy does not give any tribes. The [[Tubanti]] are just south of the Chatti and at the other end of what was then the Black Forest, the Varisti, whose location is known. One possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times. The region between the forest and the Danube, though, included about a dozen settlements, or \"cantons\".\n\nPtolemy's view of Germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the Black Forest region and was replaced by a canton structure. The tribes stayed in the Roman province, perhaps because the Romans offered stability. Also, Caracalla perhaps{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper Main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe, such as the Chatti or Cherusci, against whom Rome had suffered grievous losses. By Caracalla's time, the name Alemanni was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army (the \"war bands\").\n\n===Concentration of Germanic peoples under Ariovistus===\nThe term Suebi has a double meaning in the sources. On the one hand Tacitus' ''Germania'' tells us ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01030.htm Chapters 38, 39]) that they occupy more than half of Germany, use a distinctive hair style, and are spiritually centered on the [[Semnones]]. On the other hand, the Suebi of the upper Danube are described as though they were a tribe.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably to be found in the German attack on the Gallic fortified town of [[Vesontio]] in 58 BC. The upper Rhine and Danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at Vesontio.\n\n[[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' tells us ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div2 1.51]) that [[Ariovistus]] had gathered an army from a wide region of Germany, but especially the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Triboci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]] and [[Sedusii]]. The Suebi were being invited to join. They lived in 100 cantons ([http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=4&division=div2 4.1]) from which 1000 young men per year were chosen for military service, a citizen-army by our standards and by comparison with the Roman professional army.\n\nAriovistus had become involved in an invasion of [[Gaul]], which the German wished to settle. Intending to take the strategic town of Vesontio, he concentrated his forces on the Rhine near Lake Constance, and when the Suebi arrived, he crossed. The Gauls had called to Rome for military aid. Caesar occupied the town first and defeated the Germans before its walls, slaughtering most of the German army as it tried to flee across the river (1.36ff). He did not pursue the retreating remnants, leaving what was left of the German army and their dependents intact on the other side of the Rhine.\n\nThe Gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the Romans. In 53 BC the [[Treveri]] broke their alliance and attempted to break free of Rome. Caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the Germans. He crossed the Rhine to forestall that event, a successful strategy. Remembering their expensive defeat at the Battle of Vesontio, the Germans withdrew to the Black Forest, concentrating there a mixed population dominated by Suebi. As they had left their tribal homes behind, they probably took over all the former Celtic cantons along the Danube.\n<!-- This material will be going back in as soon as I set up for it: The Alemanni emerged from the [[Irminones]]. Other groups included the [[Brisgavi]], [[Juthungi]], [[Bucinobantes]], [[Lentienses]], and perhaps the [[Armalausi]]. Close allies of the Alemanni were the East Germanic [[Suebi]], or Suabi (hence [[Swabia]]). The Hermunduri had apparently belonged to the Suebi, but it is likely enough that reinforcements from new Suebic tribes had now moved westward. In later times the names ''Alemanni'' and ''Suebi'' seem to become synonymous, although some of the Suebi later migrated to [[Hispania]] and established an independent kingdom there that endured well into the 6th century. -->\n\n===Conflicts with the Roman Empire===\n[[File:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Limes Germanicus]] 83 to 260 CE.]]\n{{Campaignbox Rome against the Alamanni}}\nThe Alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th centuries. They launched a major invasion of [[Gaul]] and northern [[Italy]] in 268, when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the [[Goths]] from the east. Their raids throughout the three parts of Gaul were traumatic: [[Gregory of Tours]] (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Gallienus]] (253\u2013260), when the Alemanni assembled under their \"king\", whom he calls [[Chrocus]], who \"by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call ''Vasso Galatae'' in the Gallic tongue,\" martyring many Christians ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 ''Historia Francorum'' Book I.32\u201334]). Thus 6th-century Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of [[Roman temple]]s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.\n\nIn the early summer of 268, the [[Roman Emperors|Emperor]] [[Gallienus]] halted their advance into Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in September, Gallienus' successor [[Claudius Gothicus]] turned north to deal with the Alemanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the [[Po River]].\n\nAfter efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alemanni to battle at the [[Battle of Lake Benacus]] in November. The Alemanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.\n\nTheir most famous battle against Rome took place in [[Argentoratum]] ([[Strasbourg]]), in 357, where they were defeated by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], later Emperor of Rome, and their king [[Chnodomarius]] was taken prisoner to Rome.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 366, the Alemanni yet again crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces, this time being defeated by Valentinian (see [[Battle of Solicinium]]). In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the [[Rhine|Rhine river]] a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The crossing is described in [[Wallace Breem]]'s historical novel ''[[Eagle in the Snow]]''. The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] gives the account. At ''Alba Augusta'' ([[Alba-la-Romaine]]) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to [[Viviers, Ard\u00e8che|Viviers]], but in Gregory's account at Mende in [[Loz\u00e8re]], also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  It is thought{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence.\n\n====List of battles between Romans and Alemanni====\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.]]\n* 259, [[Battle of Mediolanum]]\u2014[[Emperor Gallienus]] defeats the Alemanni to rescue Rome\n* 268, [[Battle of Lake Benacus]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Claudius II]] defeat the Alemanni.\n* 271\n** [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Battle of Placentia]]\u2014Emperor [[Aurelian]] is defeated by the Alemanni forces invading Italy\n** [[Battle of Fano]]\u2014Aurelian defeats the Alemanni, who begin to retreat from Italy\n** [[Battle of Pavia (271)|Battle of Pavia]]\u2014Aurelian destroys the retreating Alemanni army.\n* 298\n** [[Battle of Lingones]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Constantius Chlorus]] defeats the Alemanni\n** [[Battle of Vindonissa]]\u2014Constantius again defeats the Alemanni\n* 356, [[Battle of Reims (356)|Battle of Reims]]\u2014[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] is defeated by the Alemanni\n* 357, [[Battle of Strasbourg]]\u2014Julian expels the Alemanni from the [[Rhineland]]\n* 367, [[Battle of Solicinium]]\u2014Romans under Emperor [[Valentinian I]] defeat yet another Alemanni incursion.\n* 378, [[Battle of Argentovaria]]\u2014Western Emperor [[Gratianus]] is victorious over the Alemanni, yet again.\n* 451, [[Battle of the Catalaunian Fields]]-Roman General [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] and his army of Romans and barbarian allies defeat Attila's army of [[Huns]] and other Germanic allies, including the Alemanni.\n* 457, [[Battle of Campi Cannini]], Alemanni invade Italy and are defeated near [[Lake Maggiore]] by [[Majorian]]\n* 554, [[Battle of the Volturnus (554)|Battle of the Volturnus]]-Armenian-Roman General [[Narses]] defeats a combined force of [[Franks]] and Alemanni in southern [[Italy]].\n\n===Subjugation by the Franks===\n{{main|Alamannia}}\n[[File:Alamannien Hochburgund ca 1000.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Alemannia (yellow) and Upper Burgundy (green) around 1000.]]\nThe kingdom of Alamannia between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until 496, when the Alemanni were conquered by [[Clovis I]] at the [[Battle of Tolbiac]]. The war of Clovis with the Alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by [[Gregory of Tours]]. ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html#n30 Book II.31]) Subsequently, the Alemanni formed part of the [[Franks|Frankish]] dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.\n\nIn 746, [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the [[blood court at Cannstatt]], and for the following century, Alemannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the [[treaty of Verdun]] of 843, Alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of [[Louis the German]], the precursor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The duchy persisted until 1268.\n\n==Culture==\n===Language===\n[[File:Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png|thumb|The traditional distribution area of Western Upper German (Alemannic) dialect features in the 19th and 20th centuries]]\n\nThe German spoken today over the range of the former Alemanni is termed [[Alemannic German]], and is recognised among the subgroups of the [[High German languages]].

Today, ''Alemannic'' is a linguistic term, referring to [[Alemannic German]], encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (German State), in western [[Bavaria]] (German State), in [[Vorarlberg]] (Austrian State), [[Swiss German]] in Switzerland and the [[Alsatian language]] of the [[Alsace]] (France).\n\n===Political organization===\nThe Alemanni established a series of territorially defined ''pagi'' (cantons) on the east bank of the Rhine. The exact number and extent of these ''pagi'' is unclear and probably changed over time.\n\n''Pagi'', usually pairs of ''pagi'' combined, formed kingdoms (''regna'') which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary. Ammianus describes Alemanni rulers with various terms: ''reges excelsiores ante alios'' (\"paramount kings\"), ''reges proximi'' (\"neighbouring kings\"), ''reguli'' (\"petty kings\") and ''regales'' (\"princes\").

''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. 1, pg. 114: \"[the Alamannic] prince, Gibuld, was an Arian, probably converted by Goths\".</ref>\n\nIn the mid-6th century, the Byzantine historian [[Agathias]] records, in the context of the wars of the Goths and Franks against Byzantium, that the Alemanni fighting among the troops of Frankish king [[Theudebald]] were like the Franks in all respects except religion, since\n{{quote|text=they worship certain trees, the waters of rivers, hills and mountain valleys, in whose honour they sacrifice horses, cattle and countless other animals by beheading them, and imagine that they are performing an act of piety thereby.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqsJZcQR7oIC |title=trans.

Agathias expresses his hope that the Alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances, in a manner of speaking, what eventually happened.<ref>R.

[[Columbanus]] and his disciple [[Saint Gall]]. [[Jonas of Bobbio]] records that Columbanus was active in [[Bregenz]], where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to [[Wodan]]. Despite these activities, for some time, the Alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic animal-style with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxons and of the Slavs, the Alemanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread in emulation of the Merovingian elite.\n\nFrom c. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of [[Alemannic Elder Futhark inscriptions]]. About 70 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], others on belt buckles (see [[Pforzen buckle]], [[B\u00fclach fibula]]) and other jewelry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.\nThe [[Nordendorf fibula]] (early 7th century) clearly records pagan theonyms, ''loga\u00feorewodanwigi\u00feonar '' read as  \"Wodan and Donar are magicians/sorcerers\", but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities, or a Christian protective charm against them.<ref name=\"D\u00fcwel\">{{Cite book |last=D\u00fcwel |first=Klaus |authorlink= |editor-last=Kamp |editor-first=Norbert |editor2-last=Wollasch |editor2-first=Joachim |contribution=Runen und Interpretatio Christiana: Zur Religioneschichtlichen Stellung der B\u00fcgelfidel von Nordendorf I |title=Tradition als Historische Kraft |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |location= |pages=78\u201386 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ_Mmjx5hSIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false  |isbn=311-008237-3}}</ref>\nA runic inscription on a fibula found at [[Bad Ems]] reflects Christian pious sentiment (and is also explicitly marked with a Christian cross), reading ''god fura dih deofile \u16ed'' (\"God for/before you, Theophilus!\", or alternatively \"God before you, Devil!\"). Dated to between AD 660 and 690, it marks the end of the native Alemannic tradition of runic literacy. Bad Ems is in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], on the northwestern boundary of Alemannic settlement, where Frankish influence would have been strongest.<ref>Wolfgang Jungandreas, 'God fura dih, deofile \u2020' in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur, 101, 1972, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the bishopric of [[Konstanz]] cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by 635, when [[Gunzo]] appointed [[John of Grab]] bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history unlike the Raetian bishopric of [[Chur]] (established 451) and [[Basel]] (an episcopal seat from 740, and which continued the line of Bishops of [[Augusta Raurica]], see [[Bishop of Basel]]). The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. In the early 7th century ''[[Pactus Alamannorum]]'' hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church, while [[Lantfrid]]'s ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Annales Alamannici]]\n*[[List of rulers of Alamannia]]\n*[[List of confederations of Germanic tribes]]\n*[[Armalausi]]\n*[[Varisci]]\n*[[Helvetii]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alamanni|volume=1|page=468}} Endnote: See\n* [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]] lxvii. ff.\n* [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''passim''\n* [[Gregory of Tours]], ''Historia Francorum'', book ii.\n* [[Johann Kaspar Zeuss|C.

He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of [[Charles Darwin]]'s writings in 1858.<ref name=\"tendency\"/> This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in ''[[On the Origin of Species]].'' Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the [[Amazon River basin]] and then in the [[Malay Archipelago]], where he identified the faunal divide now termed the [[Wallace Line]], which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect [[Australasia]].\n\nHe was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the \"father of [[biogeography]]\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Charles H. |title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Introduction |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/chsarwin.htm |publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]] |accessdate=27 April 2007 }}</ref> Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of [[Aposematism|warning colouration]] in animals, and the [[Wallace effect]], a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to [[speciation]] by encouraging the development of barriers against [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]]. Wallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[Planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm|title=Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace|website=people.wku.edu|access-date=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of [[spiritualism]] and his belief in a [[Mind\u2013body dualism|non-material origin]] for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.\n\nAside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.\n\nWallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and [[Charles Lyell]], he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nAlfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of [[Llanbadoc]], near [[Usk]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].<ref>Wilson ''The Forgotten Naturalist'' p. 1.</ref> He was the seventh of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. Mary Anne was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to [[William Wallace]], a leader of Scottish forces during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] in the 13th century.<ref name=WKU_bio/> Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from [[Hertford]], north of London.<ref name=\"WKU_bio\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: A Capsule Biography|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/BIOG.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405170132/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]] until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836, when he was aged 14.<ref>Wilson pp. 6\u201310.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace Mechanics Institute (crop).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A photograph from Wallace's autobiography shows the building Wallace and his brother John designed and built for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]].]]\n\nWallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the [[London Mechanics Institute]]. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer [[Robert Owen]] and of [[Thomas Paine]]. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.\n\nAt the end of 1839, they moved to [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]], Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at [[Neath]] in [[Glamorgan]] in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.<ref>Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 77\u201378.</ref><ref>Ross A. Slotten.

Since Wallace was born in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], some sources have considered him to be Welsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=28. Alfred Russel Wallace|publisher=100 Welsh heroes|url=http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/alfredrussellwallace|accessdate=23 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124191414/http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/alfredrussellwallace|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in [[Leicester]] to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and one evening he met the entomologist [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal ''Zoologist''. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.<ref>Shermer ''In Darwin's Shadow'' p. 53.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 22\u201326.</ref> William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the [[River Neath|Vale of Neath]].\n\nWallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath [[Mechanics' Institute]], founded in 1843.<ref>[http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath \"Neath Mechanics' Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110014026/http://www.tlysau.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=11281&inst_id=35&term=Neath |date=10 November 2013 }} [[Swansea University]].

In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).<ref>Slotten pp. 26\u201329.</ref><ref>Wilson pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymously published evolutionary treatise ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', Charles Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.<ref>Raby p. 78.</ref><ref>Wallace ''My Life'' pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=287 254], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=A237.1&pageseq=289 256]</ref>\n\n===Exploration and study of the natural world===\n[[File:Wallace map archipelago.jpg|thumb|300px|A map from ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' shows the physical geography of the archipelago and Wallace's travels around the area. The thin black lines indicate where Wallace travelled, and the red lines indicate chains of volcanoes.]]\n\nInspired by the chronicles of earlier travelling naturalists, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], Charles Darwin and especially [[William Henry Edwards]], Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist.<ref>Slotten pp. 34\u201337.</ref> In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the ''Mischief''. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the [[transmutation of species]].\n\nWallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near [[Bel\u00e9m]], then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist [[Richard Spruce]], along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from [[yellow fever]]), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.<ref>Wilson p. 36; Raby pp. 89, 98\u201399, 120\u201321.</ref>\n\nWallace continued charting the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.<ref>Raby pp. 89\u201395.</ref> On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig ''Helen''. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.\n\nWallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig ''Jordeson'', which was sailing from Cuba to London. The ''Jordeson'''s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.<ref>Shermer pp. 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=\"Slotten87-88\">Slotten pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nAfter his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the [[R\u00edo Negro (Argentina)|Rio Negro]] until the Indian town of [[Jativa]] on [[Orinoco River]] basin and as far west as Mic\u00faru ([[Mit\u00fa]]) on the [[Uaup\u00e9s River]]. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaup\u00e9s River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\") and two books; ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses'' and ''Travels on the Amazon''.<ref>Wilson p. 45.</ref> He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists\u2014most significantly, Darwin.<ref name=\"Slotten87-88\"/><ref>Raby p. 148.</ref><ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n[[File:Wallace frog.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration from ''The Malay Archipelago'' depicts the [[flying frog]] Wallace discovered.]]\n\nFrom 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or [[East Indies]] (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance/ |title=University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge &#124; Historical significance |publisher=Museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119040924/https://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/historical.significance|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref> His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]].\n\nWallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science.<ref>Shermer p. 14.</ref> One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog ''[[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus]]'', known as Wallace's [[flying frog]]. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]]. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.\n\nAccounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], who called it his \"favorite bedside companion\" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially ''[[Lord Jim]]''.<ref>Slotten p. 267.</ref>\n\n===Return to England, marriage and children===\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|upright|A photograph of A.R. Wallace taken in Singapore in 1862]]\n\nIn 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the [[Zoological Society of London]]. Later that year, he visited Darwin at [[Down House]], and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref>Shermer pp. 151\u201352.</ref> During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including [[sexual selection]], [[warning colouration]], and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.<ref>Slotten pp. 249\u201358.</ref> In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 235.</ref>\n\nAfter a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace.<ref>van Whye, John Dispelling the Darkness, World Scientific, 2013, pg. 310</ref> However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.<ref>Shermer p. 156.</ref> In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, [[William Mitten]], an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built [[The Dell (Thurrock)|the Dell]], a house of concrete, on land he leased in [[Grays]] in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).<ref>Slotten pp. 239\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Financial struggles===\nIn the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''.<ref>Slotten pp. 265\u201367.</ref>\n\nDespite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.<ref>Slotten pp. 299\u2013300.</ref>\n\nIn 1876, Wallace needed a \u00a3500 advance from the publisher of ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.<ref>Slotten p. 325.</ref> Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.<ref>Slotten pp. 361\u201364.</ref>\n\n===Social activism===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in ''The Malay Archipelago''. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his [[Land Tenure Reform Association]], but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and [[land reform]] in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.\n\nIn 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, ''Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims'', on the subject. He criticised the UK's [[free trade]] policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people.<ref name=\"Bibliography\">{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred Russel Wallace|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/index1.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 365\u201372.</ref> In 1889, Wallace read ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor.<ref>Slotten p. 436.</ref> After reading ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', the best selling book by the progressive land reformist [[Henry George]], Wallace described it as \"Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Buder|title=Visionaries and Planners: The Garden City Movement and the Modern Community|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evBdKUyXY7UC}}</ref>\n\nWallace opposed [[eugenics]], an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit.<ref>Slotten pp. 436\u201338.</ref> In the 1890 article \"Human Selection\" he wrote, \"Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent&nbsp;...\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Human Selection (S427: 1890)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S427.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a [[Fiat money|pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold]], which impressed the economist [[Irving Fisher]] so much that he dedicated his 1920 book ''Stabilizing the Dollar'' to Wallace.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Paper Money as a Standard of Value (S557: 1898)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S557.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nWallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for [[women's suffrage]], and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of [[militarism]].<ref>Slotten pp. 366, 453, 487\u201388.</ref><ref>Shermer pp. 23, 279.</ref> In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: \"...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Causes of War, and the Remedies (S567: 1899)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S567.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> In a letter published by the [[Daily Mail]] in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea \"...that this new horror is \"inevitable,\" and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins\u2014for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Wallace | first=Alfred| title=Flying Machines in War.

The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism.<ref>Slotten pp. 453\u201355.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''The Wonderful Century: Its successes and failures|url=https://archive.org/details/wonderfulcentur03wallgoog|publisher=Google books|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book ''The Revolt of Democracy'' just weeks before his death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=The Revolt of Democracy (S734: 1913)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S734.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Further scientific work===\nWallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographic Distribution of Animals''. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on [[biogeography]], spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist [[Alice Eastwood]] as his guide, exploring the flora of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how [[glaciation]] might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper \"English and American Flowers\". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' used information he collected on his American trip, and information he had compiled for the lectures.<ref>Shermer pp. 274\u201378.</ref><ref>Slotten pp. 379\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Restored grave of AR Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|Wallace's grave in Broadstone Cemetery, [[Broadstone, Dorset]], which was restored by the A.

It features a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Petrified wood|fossil tree trunk]] from Portland mounted on a block of [[Purbeck limestone]].]]\n\nOn 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier.<ref name=\"Slotten490\">Slotten p. 490.</ref> He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him \"the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century.\" Another commentator in the same edition said \"No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'.\"<ref>Slotten p. 491.</ref>\n\nSome of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at [[Broadstone, Dorset]].<ref name=\"Slotten490\"/> Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.\n\n==Theory of evolution==\n\n===Early evolutionary thinking===\nUnlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the [[transmutation of species]]. The concept had been advocated by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert Grant]], among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have [[radicalism (historical)|radical]], even revolutionary connotations.<ref name=\"Larson73\">Larson Evolution p. 73.</ref><ref>Peter J. Bowler, Iwan Rhys Morus. ''Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey''. University of Chicago Press, 2005, p. 141</ref>\n\nProminent anatomists and geologists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Charles Lyell]] attacked it vigorously.<ref>McGowan The Dragon Seekers pp. 101, 154\u201355.</ref><ref>Larson pp. 23\u201324, 37\u201338.</ref> It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science,<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\">Shermer p. 54.</ref>\n\nHe was also profoundly influenced by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' work, ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.<ref>Slotten p. 31.</ref> Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845:\n\n<blockquote>I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.<ref name=\"Shermer p. 54\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1847, he wrote to Bates:\n<blockquote>I should like to take some one family [of beetles] to study thoroughly, principally with a view to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am strongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.<ref>\nWallace Family Archive, 11 Oct. 1847, quoted in {{harvnb|Raby|2002|p=1}}.\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nWallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories.<ref name=\"Larson73\"/> During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers\u2014such as the Amazon and its major tributaries\u2014often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\".<ref>Slotten p. 94.</ref> Near the end of the paper he asks the question, \"Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?\"\n\nIn February 1855, while working in [[Sarawak]] on the island of [[Borneo]], Wallace wrote \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", a paper which was published in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]'' in September 1855.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Wallace Collection \u2013 Wallace's 'Sarawak law' paper | url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/collections-at-the-museum/wallace-collection/closeup.jsp?itemID=138&theme=Evolution | publisher = [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] | year = 2012 | accessdate = 14 February 2012 }}</ref> In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as [[biogeography]]. His conclusion that \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\" has come to be known as the \"Sarawak Law\". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=On the Law Which has Regulated the Introduction of Species|url=http://www.wku.edu/%7Esmithch/wallace/S020.htm|year=1855|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428194531/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S020.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did [[Edward Blyth]] who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!&nbsp;... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into ''species''.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the [[progressive creationism]] of the time and wrote that it was \"nothing very new&nbsp;... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of [[natural selection]] to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a ''species sketch'' of his continuing work in May 1856.<ref>Desmond & Moore ''Darwin'' 1991, p. 438;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browne ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging'' pp. 537\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Natural selection and Darwin===\n{{see also|Publication of Darwin's theory}}\n\nBy February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago of the reality of evolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>The problem then was not only how and why do species change, but how and why do they change into new and well defined species, distinguished from each other in so many ways; why and how they become so exactly adapted to distinct modes of life; and why do all the intermediate grades die out (as geology shows they have died out) and leave only clearly defined and well marked species, genera, and higher groups of animals?<ref>Wallace ''My Life'' p. 361.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to his autobiography, it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of [[natural selection]].<ref>Slotten pp. 144\u201345.</ref> Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of [[Ternate]] at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of [[Halmahera|Gilolo]].<ref>Slotten p. 144.</ref> From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman [[Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode]].

Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live&nbsp;... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about&nbsp;... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.''<ref>Wallace ''My Life'' pp. 361\u201362.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Darwin-Wallace medal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal]] was issued by the Linnean society on the 50th anniversary of the reading of Darwin and Wallace's papers on [[natural selection]].]]\n\nWallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.<ref>Marchant, 1916. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1593&viewtype=image&pageseq=116 p. 105]</ref> In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=111 p. 95]</ref> The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" while commenting that \"I believe I go much further than you\".<ref>Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=124 p. 108]</ref> Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, \"[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type]]\", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to [[Charles Lyell]] if he thought it worthwhile.<ref name=\"tendency\">{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Alfred |title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]] |accessdate=22 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429183411/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm |archivedate=29 April 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters&nbsp;... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"<ref>Slotten pp. 153\u201354<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Darwin, Francis, 1887, ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin'' [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=132 p. 116]</ref> Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to [[Asa Gray]] in 1857.<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 33\u201342.</ref>\n\nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.<ref>Shermer pp. 148\u201350.</ref> The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;<ref>Browne ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'' pp. 40\u201342.</ref> but, with Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing.<ref>Slotten pp. 157\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=In Darwin's Shadow: Excerpt|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/darwins-shadow/excerpt/|publisher=michaelshermer.com|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles|title=Responses to Questions Frequently Asked About Wallace: Did Darwin really steal material from Wallace to complete his theory of natural selection?|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=29 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509183747/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/FAQ.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wyhe |first=John Van |last2=Rookmaaker |first2=Kees |year=2012 |title=A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858 |url= |journal= Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|publisher=Linnean Society of London |volume=105  |pages=249\u2013252 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | last = Ball | first = Philip | title = Shipping timetables debunk Darwin plagiarism accusations   | url = http://www.nature.com/news/shipping-timetables-debunk-darwin-plagiarism-accusations-1.9613 | publisher = ''Nature News &amp; Comment'' | date = 12 December 2011 | accessdate = 26 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Defence of Darwin and his ideas====\nAfter the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper \"Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species\" in order to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the ''Origin'' on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 197\u201399.</ref>\n\nAn even lengthier defence of Darwin's work was \"Creation by Law\", a review Wallace wrote in 1867 for the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' of the book ''The Reign of Law'', which had been written by [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|George Campbell]], the 8th Duke of Argyll, as a refutation of natural selection.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=Creation by Law (S140: 1867)\n|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=23 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070602121908/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S140.htm| archivedate= 2 June 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> After an 1870 meeting of the [[British Science Association]], Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were \"no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have.\"<ref>Slotten p. 261.</ref>\n\n====Differences between Darwin's and Wallace's ideas on natural selection====\nHistorians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Kutschera | first1=U. | title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin\u2013Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection | journal=Theory in Biosciences | date=19 December 2003 | doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6 | volume=122 | issue=4 | pages=343\u201359 }}</ref> Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge.<ref>Larson p. 75.</ref><ref>Bowler & Morus p. 149.</ref> Some historians, notably [[Peter J.

Darwin had come to believe that [[sexual selection]], an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by [[John Jenner Weir]] that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. \"Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight\", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Frederick|date=1867|title=March 4,1867|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1967.tb01466.x|journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London|volume=15|pages=509\u2013566|via=}}</ref> In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.

In his 1878 book ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'', he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection.<ref>Slotten pp. 353\u201356.</ref> He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book ''Darwinism''. In 1890, he wrote a critical review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' of his friend [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'' which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".<ref name=Nature>{{cite journal | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S424.htm | title=The Colours of Animals | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | journal=Nature | date=24 July 1890 | volume=S42 | pages=289\u201391|doi=10.1038/042289a0 | bibcode=1890Natur..42..289W }}</ref>\n\n====Wallace effect====\nIn 1889, Wallace wrote the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the [[Wallace effect]],<ref>Slotten pp. 413\u201315.</ref> later referred to as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]].<ref name=\"Speciation\">{{Citation | title=Speciation | author=Jerry A.

Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although [[Thomas Huxley]] had in ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".<ref name=eiseley>{{cite book |last=Eiseley |first=Loren |title=Darwin's Century |publisher=Anchor Book |year=1958 |pages=305, 06}}</ref> He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that&nbsp;... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded.\"<ref name=eiseley /> For this paper he won Darwin's praise.\n\nShortly afterwards, Wallace became a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]]. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of the universe was the development of the human spirit.<ref>Wallace ''Darwinism'' p. 477.</ref> These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that [[sexual selection]] could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.<ref>Shermer pp. 157\u201360.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter Six.

One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.<ref>Shermer p. 149.</ref> Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', occasionally in strong disagreement.<ref>Slotten pp. 289\u201390.</ref>\n\nBoth Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:\n* Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of the sperm or egg, which manifest in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is likely to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts.<ref>Garry Hamilton.

Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.\n* [[Epigenetic]] mechanisms, where evolution can occur in the absence of change in DNA sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.\n* Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) that cause [[mass extinction]]s of species that, until the event, were perfectly adapted to their environment, such as the dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.\n\nWallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles.  In 1889, Wallace published the book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.<ref>Slotten p. 409.</ref> Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.<ref>Shermer p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Other scientific contributions==\n\n===Biogeography and ecology===\n[[File:Wallace03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of the world from ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' shows Wallace's six biogeographical regions.]]\n\nIn 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, [[Philip Sclater]], and [[Alfred Newton]], Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time.<ref>Slotten p. 301.</ref> He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.<ref>Slotten p. 315.</ref> Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently [[Great American Interchange|connecting North America and South America]]) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on [[zoogeography]] for the next 80 years.<ref>Slotten pp. 320\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that [[tapirs]] had originated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.<ref>Bowler (2013), p. 152.</ref> Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the [[Quaternary extinction event|mass extinction of megafauna]] in the late [[Pleistocene]]. In ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".<ref>Wallace ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'' p. 150.</ref> He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, but by the time he wrote ''World of Life'' (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".<ref>Wallace ''The World of Life'' (1911) p. 264.</ref>\n[[File:Wallace-line1.jpg|thumb|left|The line separating the Indo-Malayan and the Austro-Malayan region in Wallace's ''On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago'' (1863)]]\nIn 1880, Wallace published the book ''Island Life'' as a sequel to ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals''. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[Hawaiian Islands]] (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like [[Madagascar]]) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the [[lemur]]s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased [[glaciation]], may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great [[ice age]]s. ''Island Life'' was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.<ref>Slotten p. 361.</ref>\n\n===Environmental issues===\nWallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In ''Tropical Nature and Other Essays'' (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion.<ref>Slotten pp. 352\u201353.</ref> In ''Island Life'', Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of [[invasive species]]. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of [[Saint Helena]], he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!<ref>Wallace ''Island Life'' pp. 283\u201384.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In ''The World of Life'' (1911) he wrote:\n\n<blockquote> These considerations should lead us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;&nbsp;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion!<ref>Wallace ''World of Life'' p. 279.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Astrobiology===\nWallace's 1904 book ''Man's Place in the Universe'' was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the [[planetary habitability|likelihood of life on other planets]]. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the [[liquid phase]]. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).\n\nHis treatment of [[Mars]] in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with a book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' to criticise the claims made by [[Percival Lowell]] that there were [[Martian canals]] built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions.<ref>Slotten p. 474.</ref> Among other things, Wallace pointed out that [[spectroscopic analysis]] had shown no signs of [[water vapour]] in the [[Martian atmosphere]], that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=''Is Mars Habitable'' (S730: 1907)|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172431/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S730.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Richard Milner comments: \"It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace&nbsp;... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Wet Red World?

Stately palm-trees rise\n\nOn every side, and numerous trees unknown\n\nSave by strange names uncouth to English ears.\n\nHere I dwelt awhile the one white man\n\nAmong perhaps two hundred living souls.\n\nThey pass a peaceful and contented life'\n\nThe poem is a lyrical description of the life of a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between the lives of the people living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.\n\nWallace concludes:\n\nI'd be an Indian here, and live content\n\nTo fish, and hunt, and paddle my canoe,\n\nAnd see my children grow, like young wild fawns,\n\nIn health of body and in peace of mind,\n\nRich without wealth, and happy without gold !\n\nThe poem is referenced and partially recited in the BBC television series '[[The Ascent of Man]]'.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Spiritualism<!--linked from 'Spiritualism (philosophy)'-->===\nIn a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity&nbsp;... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=1861 Letter from Wallace to Thomas Sims|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=4 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220201439/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/quotes.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWallace was an enthusiast of [[phrenology]].<ref>Slotten pp. 203\u201305.</ref> Early in his career, he experimented with [[hypnosis]], then known as [[mesmerism]]. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success.<ref>Slotten pp. 234\u201335.</ref> When he began his experiments with mesmerism, the topic was very controversial and early experimenters, such as [[John Elliotson]], had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment.<ref name=\"Belief and Spiritualism\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Chapter One.

In 1893, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest.

For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fianc\u00e9e broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism.<ref>Slotten p. 236.</ref> Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.<ref name=\"Belief and Spiritualism\"/><ref name=\"Shermer199201\">Shermer pp. 199\u2013201.</ref>\n\nSpiritualism appealed to many educated [[Victorian morality|Victorians]] who no longer found traditional religious doctrine, such as that of the [[Church of England]], acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science.<ref name = \"Slotten_p4\">Slotten p. 4.</ref> However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief.<ref name=\"Belief and Spiritualism\"/><ref name=\"Shermer199201\"/> Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer [[Robert Owen]], who was one of Wallace's early idols,<ref>Slotten p. 232.</ref> the physicists [[William Crookes]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]], the mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]], and the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]].<ref name = \"Slotten_p4\"/><ref>Shermer p. 183.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1860s the stage magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] exposed the trickery of the [[Davenport brothers]].<ref>Steinmeyer, Jim (2005).

[[Dodd, Mead and Company]]. p. 157</ref>\n\nWallace's very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation. In 1875 Wallace published the evidence he believed proved his position in his book 'On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism' which is a compilation of essays he wrote over a period of time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-108-00021-5|location=Cambridge|pages=v}}</ref> In his chapter entitled 'Modern Spiritualism: Evidence of Men of Science', Wallace refers to \"three men of the highest eminence in their respective departments\" who were Professor De Morgan, Professor Hare and Judge Edmonds who all investigated spiritualist phenomena.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-108-00021-5|location=Cambridge|pages=80\u201390}}</ref> However, Wallace himself is only quoting their results and was not present at any of their investigations. His vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]], [[Thomas Huxley]], and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Evidence of this can be seen in Wallace's letters dated 22 November and 1 December 1866, to Thomas Huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which Huxley, politely but emphatically, declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/collections/library-collections/wallace-letters-online/index.html|title=Wallace Letters Online|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|date=16 November 2010|website=The Alfred Russel Wallace Correspondence Project|access-date=}}</ref> Others, such as the physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] and zoologist [[E. Ray Lankester]] became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with ''[[The Lancet]]'' as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace's work for the rest of his career.<ref>Slotten pp. 298\u2013351.</ref> When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] responded:\n\n<blockquote>Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings&nbsp;... This he is said to have done in an underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zeNOFryZZ5cC&pg=PT408#v=onepage&q&f=false Slotten pp. 357\u201358].</ref><ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=In Darwin's Shadow : The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History|author=Shermer, M.|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-803381-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSSkPqmbeXIC&pg=PA274|page=274|accessdate=9 October 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request.<ref>Slotten p. 362.</ref>\n\n===Flat Earth wager===\n{{see also|Bedford Level experiment}}\nIn 1870, a [[Flat Earth|Flat-Earth]] proponent named John Hampden offered a \u00a3500 wager (equivalent to about \u00a3{{inflation|UK|500|1870|r=-3|fmt=c}} in present-day terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe judge for the wager, the editor of ''Field'' magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.<ref>Shermer pp. 258\u201361.</ref>\n\n===Anti-vaccination campaign===\nIn the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox [[vaccination]]. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the [[germ theory of disease]] was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human [[immune system]] to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\">Slotten pp. 422\u201336.</ref>\n\nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.<ref name=\"Shermer215\"/> Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.<ref name=\"Shermer215\">Shermer pp. 215\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a [[Royal Commission]] investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. ''[[The Lancet]]'' averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, ''Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime'', attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by ''The Lancet'', which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.<ref name=\"Slotten422-436\"/>\n\n==Legacy and historical perception==\n[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace - Project Gutenberg eText 14558.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wallace and his signature on the frontispiece of ''Darwinism'' (1889)]]\nAs a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics.<ref>Shermer pp. 292\u201394.</ref> He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Medal]] and [[Darwin Medal]] in 1868 and 1890 respectively,<ref name=eb1911>{{Cite EB1911 | wstitle=Wallace, Alfred Russel}}</ref> and the [[Order of Merit]] in 1908.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28194 |supp=y|page=8162|date=9 November 1908}}</ref> Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.\n\nHe was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science.<ref name = \"Slotten_p6\"/> A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.\n\nRecently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for ''New Yorker'' magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jonathan |title=Missing Link: Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin's neglected double |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2007/02/12/070212crat_atlarge_rosen |publisher=The New Yorker Feb 2007|accessdate=25 April 2007}}</ref> There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page |url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm |publisher=hosted by Western Kentucky University |accessdate=13 May 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070523065328/http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/index1.htm| archivedate= 23 May 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\nIn a 2010 book, the environmentalist [[Tim Flannery]] claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,'<ref>Flannery, p. 32.</ref> and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.\n[[File:Bronze statue of Alfred Russel Wallace.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith's]] statue of Wallace, looking up at a bronze model of a [[Ornithoptera croesus|Wallace's golden birdwing butterfly]].

In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.<ref>Shermer pp. 15\u201317.</ref> An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.<ref name=\"Bibliography\"/>\n\n===Selected books===\n* {{cite book\n|title=Palm trees of the Amazon and their uses.\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1853\n|publisher=London\n|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42833\n|format=Biodiversity Heritage Library\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1869\n|title=The Malay Archipelago\n|publisher=Harper\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EldIBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&ved=0ahUKEwil46Hll5PKAhUE8CYKHem9BZMQ6AEIOjAF\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uGSFcFcSBmkC\n|format=Google Books\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1870\n|publisher=Macmillan and Company\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=The Geographical Distribution of Animals\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HmqtZfTfQUMC\n|format=Google Books\n|year=1876\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Tropical Nature, and Other Essays\n|last=Wallace |first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1878\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=09TeahwIfN0C\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=[[Image:wikisource-logo.svg|16x16px]] [[s:Island Life|Island Life]]\n|year=1881\n|publisher=Harper and brothers\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|title=[[Image:wikisource-logo.svg|16x16px]] [[s:Darwinism (Wallace)|Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications]]\n|year=1889\n|publisher=Macmillan }}\n* {{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeoftrave00wall|format=Internet Archive|edition=1889|location=|pages=|year=1889|isbn=|publisher=Ward, Lock}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=Man's Place in the Universe\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1903\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39928\n|format=Gutenberg\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=My Life\n|last=Wallace\n|first=Alfred Russel\n|year=1905\n|publisher=Chapman & Hall\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_dYEAAAAYAAJ\n|format=Google Books\n}}\n\n===Selected papers===\n* 1853: On the Monkeys of the Amazon.

major [[centre-left]] [[List of political parties in Australia|political party in Australia]]. The party has been in [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]] at the federal level since the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]]. [[Bill Shorten]] has been the party's federal parliamentary leader since 13 October 2013. The party is a federal party with [[List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party|branches]] in each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]]. Labor is in government in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], and in both the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Northern Territory]]. The party competes against the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] for political office at the [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state]] (and sometimes [[Local government in Australia|local]]) levels. It is the oldest political party in Australia. \n\nLabor's constitution has long stated: \"The Australian Labor Party is a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\">[http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 Australian Labor Party National Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182841/http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |date=23 September 2015 }}.

Labor governments have not attempted the \"democratic socialisation\" of any industry since the 1940s, when the [[Chifley Government]] failed to nationalise the private banks, and in fact have [[privatization|privatised]] several industries such as aviation and banking. Labor's current National Platform describes the party as \"a modern [[Social democracy|social democratic]] party\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\"/>\n\nThe ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] in 1901. Nevertheless, it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging [[Australian labour movement|labour movement in Australia]], formally beginning in 1891. Labor is thus the country's oldest political party. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 federal election]]. The ALP formed the world's first [[List of Labour Parties|Labour Party]] government, as well as the world's first [[social democratic]] government at a national level.<ref name=moadoph>{{cite web|last=Rhodes |first=Campbell |url=https://moadoph.gov.au/blog/a-perfect-picture-of-the-statesman-john-christian-watson/ |title=A perfect picture of the statesman: John Christian Watson |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy |date=1904-04-27 |accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref> Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian Parliament, at the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]].

Labor tradition ascribes the founding of Queensland Labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the \"[[Tree of Knowledge (Australia)|Tree of Knowledge]]\") in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891. The [[Balmain, New South Wales]] branch of the party claims to be the oldest in Australia. Labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|New South Wales]] and [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|South Australia]], 1893 in Queensland, and later in the other colonies.\n\nThe first election contested by Labour candidates was the [[New South Wales colonial election, 1891|1891 New South Wales election]], when Labour candidates (then called the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales) won 35 of 141 seats. The major parties were the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] and [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] parties and Labour held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. It offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McMullen |first1=Ross |year=2004 |title=So Monstrous a Travesty: Chris Watson and the World's First National Labour Government |location=Carlton North, Victoria |publisher=Scribe Publications |page=4 |isbn=978-1-920769-13-0}}</ref> The [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|United Labor Party (ULP) of South Australia]] was founded in 1891, and three candidates were that year elected to the [[South Australian Legislative Council]].<ref name=PHA>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/chronology/may/9-may-1891-united-labor-party-elected-to-legislati.shtml|title=9 May 1891 United Labor Party elected to Legislative Council (Celebrating South Australia)|author=Alison Painter|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The first successful [[South Australian House of Assembly]] candidate was [[John McPherson]] at the [[East Adelaide by-election, 1892|1892 East Adelaide by-election]]. [[Richard Hooper (Australian politician)|Richard Hooper]] however was elected as an Independent Labor candidate at the [[Wallaroo by-election, 1891|1891 Wallaroo by-election]], while he was the first \"labor\" member of the House of Assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ULP.\n\nAt the [[South Australian colonial election, 1893|1893 South Australian elections]] the ULP was immediately elevated to balance of power status with 10 of 54 lower house seats. The liberal government of [[Charles Kingston]] was formed with the support of the ULP, ousting the conservative government of [[John Downer]]. So successful, less than a decade later at the [[South Australian state election, 1905|1905 election]], [[Thomas Price (South Australia politician)|Thomas Price]] formed the world's first stable Labor government. [[John Verran]] led Labor to form the state's first of many [[majority government]]s at the [[South Australian state election, 1910|1910 election]].\n\nIn 1899, [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week while the [[Conservatism|conservatives]] regrouped after a split.\n\nThe colonial Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the [[Federation of Australia]]. Some Labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming  that the Senate as proposed was too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist colonial upper houses and the [[House of Lords|British House of Lords]]. They feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The first Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> leader and Prime Minister, [[Chris Watson]], however, was a supporter of federation.\n\nHistorian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales,  argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative.  After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks.<ref>Celia  Hamilton, \"Irish\u2010Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890\u20131910.\" ''Historical Studies: Australia & New Zealand'' (1958) 8#31: 254-267.</ref>\n\n===Early decades at the federal level===\nThe [[Australian federal election, 1901|federal parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour Party. In total, they won 14 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives, collectively holding the balance of power, and the Labour members now met as the Federal Parliamentary Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> Party (informally known as the [[caucus]]) on 8 May 1901 at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], the meeting place of the first federal Parliament.{{sfn|Faulkner|Macintyre|2001|p=3}} The caucus decided to support the incumbent [[Protectionist Party]] in [[minority government]], while the [[Free Trade Party]] formed the [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]]. It was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level. Labour <!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context -->under [[Chris Watson]] doubled its vote at the [[Australian federal election, 1903|1903 federal election]] and continued to hold the balance of power. In April 1904, however, Watson and [[Alfred Deakin]] fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the [[Conciliation]] and [[Arbitration]] Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Free Trade leader [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour<!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context --> [[Prime Minister of Australia]], and the world's first Labour head of government at a national level ([[Anderson Dawson]] had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), though his was a [[minority government]] that lasted only four months. He was aged only 37, and is still the youngest Prime Minister in Australia's history.<ref name=adbWatson>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Nairn |first= Bede |year= 1990 |id= A120450b |title= Watson, John Christian (Chris) (1867\u20131941) |volume=12 | accessdate =9 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] of the [[Free Trade Party]] adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines \u2013 prior to the [[Australian federal election, 1906|1906 federal election]], he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the [[Protectionist Party]] in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]] and regarded a [[two-party system]] as very much the norm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Charles Richardson |url=https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/images/stories/policy-magazine/2009-autumn/25-1-09-charles-richardson.pdf |title=Fusion: The Party System We Had To Have? |format=PDF |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThough Watson further strengthened Labour's position in 1906, he stepped down from the leadership the following year, to be succeeded by [[Andrew Fisher]] who formed a minority government lasting seven months from late 1908 to mid 1909. At the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 election]], Fisher led Labor to victory, forming Australia's first elected federal [[majority government]], Australia's first elected [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority, the world's first [[List of Labour Parties|Labour Party]] majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 [[Chris Watson]] minority government the world's second Labour Party government at a national level.

The state branches formed their first majority governments in [[New South Wales state election, 1910|New South Wales]] and [[South Australian state election, 1910|South Australia in 1910]], [[Western Australian state election, 1911|Western Australia in 1911]], [[Queensland state election, 1915|Queensland in 1915]] and [[Tasmanian state election, 1925|Tasmania in 1925]]. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.\n\nAnalysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals \"a band of unhappy amateurs\", made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, a doctor, and even a mine owner, indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies \u2013 in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders.\n\nIn the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for \"the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange.\" The 1922 [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|Labor Party National Conference]] adopted a similarly worded \"socialist objective,\" which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the \"[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment,\" which said that \"socialisation\" was desirable only when was necessary to \"eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.\"{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=53}} In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]].\n\nThe Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia Policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=19}} Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism.\n\nHistorically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the [[White Australia Policy]], which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about \"[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]\" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.\n\n====Name changes====\nThe ALP adopted the formal name \"Australian Labour Party\"<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> in 1908, but changed the spelling to \"Labor\" in 1912. While it is standard practice in [[Australian English]] both today and at the time to spell the word ''labour'' with a \"u\", the party was influenced by the [[Labor history of the United States|United States labor movement]], and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the American-born [[King O'Malley]], was successful in having the spelling \"modernised\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=History of the Australian Labor Party |access-date=25 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407161924/http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php |archive-date=7 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the [[labour movement]] in general.<ref>Clarke, FG, ''Australia: A Concise Political and Social History'' (Sydney: Harcourt Brace & Company 1996), p 205</ref>\n\nIn South Australia the United Labor Party became the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party on 14 September 1917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60323264 |title=What's in a name?: Trove |publisher=Nla.gov.au |date=1917-09-15 |accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War and beyond===\nThe [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of the [[Second World War]] and initial stages of transition to peace. Labor leader [[John Curtin]] became prime minister in October 1941 when two independents crossed the floor of Parliament. Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that \"Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom\", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government]]). Remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]], Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by [[Ben Chifley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/ |title=John Curtin \u2013 Australia's PMs \u2013 Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Chifley Labor won the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 election]] and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peacetime economy.

With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated [[Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation|Miners' Federation]], Chifley lost office in 1949 to [[Robert Menzies]]' Liberal-National Coalition.

This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government.<ref>In 1969\u20131970, before the ACT and NT achieved self-government, the Liberal and National Coalition was in power federally and in all six states. [http://elections.uwa.edu.au/ University of WA elections database]</ref> Labor narrowly lost government in Western Australia at the 2008 state election and Victoria at the [[Victorian state election, 2010|2010 state election]]. These losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in New South Wales in [[2011 New South Wales State Election|2011]], Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 2012|2012]], the Northern Territory in [[Northern Territory general election, 2012|2012]], Federally in [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013]] and Tasmania in [[Tasmanian state election, 2014|2014]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/barry-ofarrell-smashes-labor-in-nsw-election/story-e6frfkvr-1226028779988 | work=The Sunday Telegraph | first=Barclay | last=Crawford | title=Barry O'Farrell smashes Labor in NSW election | date=27 March 2011}}</ref> Labor secured a good result in the Australian Capital Territory in [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2012|2012]] and, despite losing its majority, the party retained government in South Australia in [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-24/weatherill-pledges-more-regional-focus/5340926|work=the Australian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Weatherill pledges more regional focus amid Brock support |date= 24 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most of these reversals proved only temporary with Labor returning to government in Victoria in [[Victorian state election, 2014|2014]] and in Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015]] after spending only one term in opposition in both states.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-state-election-2015/queensland-election-state-wakes-to-new-political-landscape-20150131-132ybk.html| work=the Brisbane Times | first=Amy | last=Remeikis | title=Queensland election: State wakes to new political landscape | date= 1 February 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, after winning the [[Fisher state by-election, 2014|2014 Fisher by-election]] by nine votes from a 7.3 percent swing, the Labor government in South Australia went from minority to majority government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/labor-nat-cook-takes-seat-of-fisher-by-election-recount/5969402| work=the Australian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Fisher by-election: Recount sees Labor's Nat Cook win by nine votes | date= 16 December 2014}}</ref> Labor won  landslide victories in the [[Northern Territory general election, 2016|2016 Northern Territory election]] and the [[Western Australian state election, 2017|2017 Western Australian election]].\n\n==National Platform==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}\nThe policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labor's National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Party's website, \"The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007 |access-date=23 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820193739/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |archive-date=20 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that \"Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.\" While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: \"Labor believes in a strong role for national government&nbsp;\u2013 the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.\" Labor \"will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.\" The platform and Labor \"believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.\" For Labor, \"government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.\" Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.\n\nIn practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform.\n\n==Party structure==\n\n===National Executive and Secretariat===\nThe [[Australian Labor Party National Executive]] is the chief administrative authority of the Australian Labor Party, subject only to Labor's [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|National Conference]]. The Executive is responsible for organising the triennial National Conference; carrying out the decisions of National Conference; interpreting the National Constitution, the National Platform and decisions of National Conference; and directing federal members.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALP National Platform 2011 |url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |website=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=9 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182841/http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference decides the party's platform, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|national executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[Noah Carroll]]. The most recent National Conference was the 47th conference held from 24 to 26 July 2015.<ref>ALP: [https://lab15.org.au Welcome to the 47th Australian Labor Party National Conference]</ref>\n\nThe head office of the ALP, the National Secretariat, is managed by the National Secretary. It plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy. It acts as a permanent secretariat to the National Executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party. As the National Secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections, it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation.\n\n===Federal Parliamentary Labor Party===\n\nThe elected members of the Labor party in both houses of the national Parliament meet as the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, also known as the [[Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=215}}</ref> Besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics, the Caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders. Until 2013 the parliamentary leaders were elected by the Caucus from among its members. The leader has historically been a member of the House of Representatives. Since October 2013, a ballot of both the Caucus and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-elected-labor-leader-20131013-2vfzy.html|title=Bill Shorten elected Labor leader|author=Harrison, Bill|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> When the Labor Party is in government, the party leader is the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and the deputy leader is the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]]. If a Labor prime minister resigns or dies in office, the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers.\n\n===State and territory branches===\n{{main|List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party}} \nThe Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office.\n\nMembers join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income.  The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are [[Political donations in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].\n\nMembers are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, [[Australian Labor Party (ACT Branch)|ACT Labor]] directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\nIn some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.\n\n====Country Labor====\n'''Country Labor''' is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas. It functions as a sort of [[ginger group]] within the party, and is somewhat analogous to [[Australian Young Labor|its youth wing]]. The '''Country Labor Party''' is registered as a separate party in [[New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/candidates_and_parties/registered_political_parties/list_of_registered_parties List of Registered Parties], Electoral Commission NSW.</ref>and is also registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) for federal elections.<ref name=aec>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ Current register of political parties], Australian Electoral Commission.</ref> It does not have the same status in other states, and consequently that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper.\n\nThe creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the June 1999 ALP state conference in New South Wales. In May 2000, following Labor's success at the [[Benalla state by-election, 2000|2000 Benalla by-election]] in Victoria, [[Kim Beazley]] announced that the ALP intended to register a separate \"Country Labor Party\" with the AEC;<ref name=boland>[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/country-labor-new-direction Country Labor: a new direction?], 7 June 2000, retrieved 29 September 2017</ref> this occurred in October 2000.<ref name=aec/> The Country Labor designation is most frequently used in New South Wales. According to the ALP's financial statements for the 2015\u201316 financial year, NSW Country Labor had around 2,600 members (around 17 percent of the party total), but almost no assets. It recorded a severe funding shortfall at the [[New South Wales state election, 2015|2015 NSW state election]], and had to rely on a $1.68-million loan from the party proper to remain solvent. It had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources, but the NSW Electoral Commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately. Instead the party proper had to loan Country Labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/nearinsolvent-country-labor-may-never-repay-168m-to-party/news-story/b760e84faa14fda082bbb33600ec4743 Near-insolvent Country Labor \u2018may never repay\u2019 $1.68m to party], ''[[The Australian]]'', 28 July 2017.</ref>\n\n===Australian Young Labor===\n{{main|Australian Young Labor}} \nAustralian Young Labor is the youth wing of the Australian Labor Party, where all members under age 26 are automatically members. It is the peak youth body within the ALP. Former Presidents of AYL have included former NSW Premier Bob Carr, Federal Manager of Opposition Business Tony Burke, former Special Minister of State Senator John Faulkner, former Australian Workers Union National Secretary and current Member for Maribyrnong and Federal Labor Leader Bill Shorten as well as dozens of State Ministers and MPs. The current national president is Jack Boyd, from the New South Wales Right (NSW Centre Unity).\n\n===Networks===\nThe Australian Labor Party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. The national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Platform of the Australian Labor Party|url=https://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/ALP_National_Platform.pdf|publisher=Australian Labor Party|accessdate=16 March 2016|page=232}}</ref> Examples of such groups include the [[Labor Environment Action Network]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lean.net.au/|title=Labor Environment Action Network|work=Labor Environment Action Network|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Rainbow Labor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923163414/http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/ |archivedate=23 September 2011 }}</ref> and Labor for Refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/labor4refugees|title=Labor for Refugees|work=Facebook|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently{{clarify|date=May 2016}} gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference.\n\n==Factions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nThe Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (National Right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] (National Left). Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Socialist Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more liberal on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland.\n\nSome trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU). Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMMEU) and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] (CPSU). These affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. In some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments. On other issues, such as opposition to the [[Howard Government]]'s industrial relations policy, called [[WorkChoices]], most unions were in agreement.\n\n[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.\n\n==ALP federal parliamentary leaders==\nThe current leader of the ALP is [[Bill Shorten]] since 13 October 2013, and the deputy leader is [[Tanya Plibersek]]. In accordance with party rules, Shorten's leadership was reaffirmed by party members on 8 July 2016, following the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].\n\nFor a list of ALP federal parliamentary leaders and deputy leaders see [[Leaders of the Australian Labor Party]].\n\n==Labor state and territory parliamentary leaders==\n{{Infobox political party\n|country =\n| name = State Lower House Seats\n|native_name =\n|colorcode = {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\n|seats1_title = [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Parliament]]\n|seats1 = {{Composition bar|34|93|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats2_title = [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|VIC Parliament]]\n|seats2 = {{Composition bar|45|88|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats3_title = [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|QLD Parliament]]\n|seats3 = {{Composition bar|48|93|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats4_title = [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|WA Parliament]]\n|seats4 = {{Composition bar|40|59|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats5_title = [[South Australian House of Assembly|SA Parliament]]\n|seats5 = {{Composition bar|19|47|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats6_title = [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|TAS Parliament]]\n|seats6 = {{Composition bar|10|25|hex=#DC241f}}\n}}\n{{Infobox political party\n|colorcode = {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\n|country =\n| name = Territory Assembly Seats<ref>In the [[Norfolk Legislative Assembly|Norfolk Island Assembly]] all nine seats are held by Independents.</ref>\n|native_name =\n|seats1_title = [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|ACT Assembly]]\n|seats1 = {{Composition bar|12|25|hex=#DC241f}}\n|seats2_title = [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|NT Assembly]]\n|seats2 = {{Composition bar|18|25|hex=#DC241f}}\n}}\n\nThe current leaders of state and territory Labor branches are:\n\n* [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|NSW Labor]] \u2014 [[Luke Foley]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Opposition Leader of New South Wales]] since 5 January 2015\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Victorian Labor]] \u2014 [[Daniel Andrews]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Premier of Victoria]] since 4 December 2014\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Queensland Labor]] \u2014 [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Premier of Queensland]] since 14 February 2015\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|WA Labor]] \u2014 [[Mark McGowan]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Premier of Western Australia]] since 17 March 2017\n* [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|SA Labor]] \u2014 [[Peter Malinauskas]] \u2013 [[Leader of the Opposition (South Australia)|Opposition Leader of South Australia]] since 9 April 2018\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Tasmanian Labor]] \u2014 [[Rebecca White]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Leader of the Opposition (Tasmania)|Opposition Leader of Tasmania]] since 17 March 2017\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] \u2014 [[Andrew Barr]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory]] since 11 December 2014\n* [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Territory Labor]] \u2014 [[Michael Gunner]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] since 31 August 2016\n\n==Other past Labor politicians==\n\nSee [[:Category:Australian Labor Party politicians]]\n\nFor current ALP federal politicians, see:\n* [[List of members of the Australian House of Representatives]]\n* [[List of members of the Australian Senate]]\n\n==Federal election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Dodo is a caricature of the author. A popular but unsubstantiated belief is that Dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer, and thus would accidentally introduce himself as \"Do-do-dodgson\". Historically, the [[Dodo]] was a non-flying bird that lived on the island of [[Mauritius]], east of [[Madagascar]] in the Indian Ocean. It became extinct in the mid 17th century during the colonisation of the island by the Dutch.<ref name=\"Dead as a\">{{cite journal\n| doi = 10.1080/08912960802376199\n| last1 = Turvey | first1 = S.

[[Robinson Duckworth]].  In order to get dry after a swim, the Dodo proposes that everyone run a Caucus race \u2014 where the participants run in patterns of any shape, starting and leaving off [[equality of outcome|whenever they like, so that everyone wins]].  At the end of the race, Alice distributes [[comfits]] from her pocket to all as prizes. However this leaves no prize for herself.  The Dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket.  As she has only a [[thimble]], the Dodo requests it from her and then awards it to Alice as her prize.  The Caucus Race as depicted by Carroll is a [[satire]] on the [[politics|political]] [[caucus]] system, mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness.\n\n==Interpretations==\n\n===Disney animated film version===\n{{Main article|Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Capt.

He is merged with the character of [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat the Gardener]], which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed Pat the Dodo, but this name is never mentioned in the film. The Dodo is also the leader of the caucus race, a role originally held by the [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mouse]]. He has the appearance and personality of a sea captain. The Dodo is voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] and animated by [[Milt Kahl]].\n\nDodo is first seen as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] is floating on the sea in a bottle. Dodo is seen singing, but when Alice asks him for help, he does not notice her. On shore, Dodo is seen on a rock, organizing a caucus race. This race involves running around until one gets dry, but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves.\nDodo is later summoned by the [[White Rabbit]], when the rabbit believes a monster, actually Alice having magically grown to a giant size, is inside his home. Dodo brings [[Bill the Lizard]], and attempts to get him to go down the chimney. Bill refuses at first, but Dodo is able to convince him otherwise. However, the soot causes Alice to sneeze, sending Bill high up into the sky. Dodo then decides to burn the house down, much to the chagrin of the White Rabbit. He begins gathering wood, such as the furniture, for this purpose. However, Alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house.\n\nThe White Rabbit soon leaves, while Dodo asks for matches, not realizing that the situation has been resolved. He then asks Alice for a match, but when she doesn't have any, Dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire.\n\nThe Dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film, conducting another Caucus Race.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Tim Burton's ''Alice in Wonderland'' version===\n{{Main article|Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Uilleam\n| series      = Alice in Wonderland\n| image       = [[File:Dodoalice.wonderland.2010.jpg]]\n| caption     =\n| first       = [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]\n| last        =\n| creator     = [[Lewis Carroll]]/[[Tim Burton]]\n| portrayer   = [[Michael Gough]]\n| episode     =\n| nickname    = \n| alias       = \n| species     = [[Dodo]]\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = Adviser<br/>Caddy\n| family      =\n| spouse      =\n| significantother =\n| children    =\n| relatives   =\n| religion    =\n| nationality =\n}}\nIn [[Tim Burton]]'s adaptation of [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]], the Dodo's appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from [[John Tenniel]]'s illustration. He bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a blue coat and white spats along with glasses and a cane. He is one of Alice's good-willed advisers, taking first note of her abilities as the true Alice. He is also one of the oldest inhabitants. His name is '''Uilleam''', and he is portrayed by Michael Gough. He goes with the [[White Rabbit]], [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], and [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]] to take Alice to [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]] to decide whether Alice is the real one. He is later captured by the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking Glass)|Red Queen]]'s forces. When Alice came to the Red Queen's castle, he was seen at the Red Queen's castle yard as a caddy for the Queen's croquet game. After the Red Queen orders the release of the [[Jubjub bird]], he is then seen briefly running from it when the Tweedles went to hide from it and escaped.\n\nHis name may be based on a lecture on [[William the Conqueror]] from Chapter Three of the original novel.

These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nThe rival forces met at [[Battle of Sievershausen|Sievershausen]] on 9 July 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight. [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at [[Pforzheim]] on 8 January 1557.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe is defined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as \"a failure of a [[Fritz]],\" with \"features\" of a [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] in him, \"but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent\".

He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in 1123, and on his mother's death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of [[Billung]]. Albert was a loyal [[vassal]] of his relation, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar I, Duke of Saxony]], from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of [[Lusatia]], to the east; after Lothar became [[King of the Germans]], he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to [[Bohemia]] against the upstart, [[Sob\u011bslav I, Duke of Bohemia]] in 1126 at the [[Battle of Chlumec|Battle of Kulm]], where he suffered a short imprisonment.\n\nAlbert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law, [[Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark]], who controlled a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon [[Northern March]], in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked [[Udo IV, Margrave of the Nordmark|Udo V, Count of Stade]], the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar. Udo, however, was said to have been assassinated by servants of Albert on 15 March 1130 near [[Aschersleben]]. In spite of this, he went to [[Italy]] in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.\n\n[[Image:Adalbertus Siegel.JPG|thumb|175px|left|The seal of Albert the Bear.]]\n\nIn 1138 [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Albert's cousin and nemesis, [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by a combined force of Henry and [[Jaxa of K\u00f6penick]], and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the counties of [[Weimar]] and [[Orlam\u00fcnde]].  It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Archchamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a [[prince-elector]].\n\nOnce he was firmly established in the Northern March, Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. For  three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic [[Wends]], who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147 in which Albert took part. Albert was a part of the army that besieged [[Demmin]]. And at the end of the war, recovered [[Havelberg]], which had been lost since 983. Diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]] of the [[Hevelli]], Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title \"Margrave in Brandenburg\", he pressed the \"crusade\" against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157, which his heirs &mdash; the [[House of Ascania]] &mdash; held until the line died out in 1320.\n\nIn 1158 a feud with Henry's son, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. On his return in 1160, he, with the consent of his sons; Siegfried not being mentioned, donated land to the [[Knights of Saint John]] in memory of his wife, Sofia, at [[Werben (Elbe)|Werben]] at the [[Elbe]].<ref>Freller 2010, pp. 40</ref><ref>Freller 2010, pp. 55</ref><ref>Lyon 2013, pp. 35</ref> In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] to [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the storming of [[Milan]].\n\nIn 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in [[Stendal]], and was buried at [[Ballenstedt]].\n\n==Cognomen==\n[[Image:B\u00e4r 148-KA1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Foundation of the memorial to Albert at [[Spandau Citadel]].]]\nAlbert's personal qualities won for him the [[cognomen]] of ''the [[Bear]],'' \"not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since,\" says [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], who called Albert \"a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man.\"  He is also called by later writers \"the Handsome.\"\n\n==Family and children==\nAlbert was married in 1124 to [[Sophie of Winzenburg]] (died 25 March 1160) and they had the following children:\n# [[Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg]] (1126/1128&ndash;7 March 1184)\n# Count [[Hermann I of Orlam\u00fcnde]] (died 1176)\n# [[Siegfried, Count of Anhalt|Siegfried]] (died 24 October 1184), [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Bishop of Brandenburg]] from 1173\u20131180, [[Archbishop of Bremen|Prince-Archbishop of Bremen]], the first ranked prince, from 1180\u20131184\n# Heinrich (died 1185), a canon in [[Magdeburg]]\n# Count [[Albert of Ballenstedt]] (died after 6 December 1172)\n# Count [[Dietrich of Werben]] (died after 5 September 1183)\n# Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard of Anhalt]] (1134&ndash;9 February 1212), [[Duke of Saxony]] from 1180-1212 as Bernard III\n# [[Hedwig of Brandenburg|Hedwig]] (d. 1203), married to [[Otto II, Margrave of Meissen]]\n# Daughter, married c. 1152 to [[Vladislav of Bohemia]]\n# Adelheid (died 1162), a nun in [[Lamspringe]]\n# Gertrude, married in 1155 to Duke [[D\u011bpold I of Jamnitz|Diepold of Moravia]]\n# Sybille (died c. 1170), Abbess of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]]\n# Eilika\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

His subsequent failure to meet with and take seriously the complaints from Luther, his failure to inform Rome of the seriousness of the situation and finally Rome's refusal to act properly faced with the situation, forced Luther to more serious action. These failures to respond adequately make him notable for his failure to prevent the [[Reformation]].\n\n==Biography==\n=== Early career ===\nBorn in [[K\u00f6lln]] on the Spree, Albert was the younger son of [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg]] and of [[Margaret of Thuringia]].\n\nAfter their father's funeral, Albert and his older brother [[Joachim I Nestor]] became [[Margrave of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an [[elector of Brandenburg]]. Having studied at the University of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in 1513 became [[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] at the age of 23 and administrator of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline= y|wstitle= Albert I.

To pay for the [[pallium]] of the [[Holy See|see of Mainz]] and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 [[ducat]]s from [[Jakob Fugger]], ''[Fugger article says 48,000 ducats]'' and had obtained permission from [[Pope Leo X]] to conduct the sale of [[indulgences]] in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as he forwarded half of the income to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox. He procured the services of [[John Tetzel]] to sell the indulgences.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nLargely in reaction to the commerce in indulgences, [[Martin Luther]] wrote his famous [[95 Theses]], which led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Luther sent these to Albert on 31 October 1517, and according to a false tradition nailed a copy to the door of [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]] in [[Wittenberg]]. Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting Luther of heresy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} When the [[imperial election of 1519]] drew near, partisans of the two leading candidates ([[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]] and [[Francis I of France]]) eagerly solicited the vote of the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz, and Albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote. The electors eventually chose Charles, who became the Emperor Charles V.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:CranachBrandenburgasJerome.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal Albert, Archbishop of Mainz, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1526]]\n\nAlbert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with [[Ulrich von Hutten]], and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to [[Protestantism]]; but after the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and was among the princes who joined the [[League of Dessau]] in July 1525.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nCardinal Albert needed a prestigious church building that met his expectations at a central location in his ''[[Residenz]]'' town. Albert feared for his peace of mind in heaven, and collected more than 8,100 [[relics#Roman Catholic classification and prohibitions|relics]] and 42 holy [[human skeleton|skeletons]] which needed to be stored. These precious treasures, known as \"Hallesches Heilthum\", indirectly related to the sale of [[indulgences]] which had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Then the cardinal and the Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of [[the Reformation]] by holding far grander [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] and [[church service|services]] in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Mathis Gothart Gr\u00fcnewald 011.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]] and [[Saint Maurice]], by [[Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald]], between 1517 and 1523.  Gr\u00fcnewald used Albert of Mainz, who commissioned the painting, as the model for St. Erasmus (left).]]\nAlbert's hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg]]; and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace, although he was a member of the League of Nuremberg, formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the [[League of Schmalkalden]].  The new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 [[florin]]s. During his later years showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in his dominions.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Market Church of Our Lady===\nThe [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Market Church of Our Lady]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], which had been built to defend against the spread of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] sympathies,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} was the very spot where [[Justus Jonas]] officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his [[Good Friday]] sermon in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed. Cardinal Albert left the town permanently after the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] (''St\u00e4nde'') in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of [[Jacob Fugger]]. Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Mary's and in 1544 bishop over the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAlbert adorned the [[collegiate church]] (''Stiftskirche'')  at Halle and the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral at Mainz]] in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words ''Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae'' (Latin for: \"Lord, I admired the adornment of your house.\").

Albert was the first European ruler to establish Lutheranism, and thus [[Protestantism]], as the official [[state religion]] of his lands. He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage, ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades (1510\u20131568).\n\nA member of the [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], Albert became Grand Master, where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the Teutonic Order. But Albert, who was sympathetic to the demands of [[Martin Luther]], rebelled against the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by converting the Teutonic state into a Protestant and hereditary realm, the Duchy of Prussia, for which he paid homage to his uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I, King of Poland]]. That arrangement was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Krak\u00f3w]] in 1525. Albert pledged a personal oath to the King and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs.\n\nAlbert's rule in Prussia was fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the Catholic Church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established [[Prussian court]]. He was active in imperial politics, joining the [[League of Torgau]] in 1526, and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May 1548. Albert established schools in every town and founded [[K\u00f6nigsberg University]] in 1544.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Albert (grand master)|display=Albert|volume=1|page=497}}</ref> He promoted culture and arts, patronising the works of [[Erasmus Reinhold]] and [[Caspar Hennenberger]]. During the final years of his rule, Albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now-depleted church lands, causing peasant rebellion. The intrigues of the court favourites [[Johann Funck]] and [[Paul Skali\u0107]] also led to various religious and political disputes. Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at [[Tapiau]] on 20 March 1568. His son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]], succeeded him as Duke of Prussia.\n\nAlbert's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\n==Early life==\nAlbert was born in [[Ansbach]] in [[Franconia]] as the third son of [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. His mother was [[Sophia of Poland|Sophia]], daughter of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]], and his wife [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]]. He was raised for a career in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and spent some time at the court of [[Hermann IV of Hesse]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]], who appointed him canon of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\nNot only was he quite religious; he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories. His career was forwarded by the Church, however, and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advancement.\n\nTurning to a more active life, Albert accompanied Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to [[Italy]] in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Grand Master==\n[[File:Albrecht von Hohenzollern.jpg|thumb|upright|left|As Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, painting from 1522]]\n[[Duke Frederick of Saxony]], Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]], died in December 1510. Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], which had been held by the order under Polish [[suzerainty]] since the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I. The ill-feeling, influenced by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland, culminated in [[Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1519\u20131521)|a war]] which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia. Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe dispute was referred to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and other princes, but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war. For this purpose he visited the [[Diet of Nuremberg]] in 1522, where he made the acquaintance of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[Andreas Osiander]], by whose influence Albert was won over to [[Protestantism]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe Grand Master then journeyed to [[Wittenberg]], where he was advised by [[Martin Luther]] to abandon the rules of his order, to marry, and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself. This proposal, which was understandably appealing to Albert, had already been discussed by some of his relatives; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously, and he assured [[Pope Adrian VI]] that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] doctrines. Luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion, but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians, while Albert's brother, Margrave [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], laid the scheme before their uncle, [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Duke in Prussia==\n[[File:Prussian Homage.jpg|350px|thumb|''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]'': Albert and his brothers receive the [[Duchy of Prussia]] as a [[fief]] from  Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]], 1525. [[History painting|Painting]] by [[Jan Matejko|Matejko]], 1882.]]\nAfter some delay Sigismund assented to the offer, with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a [[Treaty of Krak\u00f3w|treaty concluded at Krak\u00f3w]], Albert pledged a [[Prussian Homage|personal oath]] to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] of the land then met at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke, who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther. This transition did not, however, take place without protest. Summoned before the imperial court of justice, Albert refused to appear and was proscribed, while the order elected a new Grand Master, [[Walter von Cronberg]], who received Prussia as a fief at the imperial [[Diet of Augsburg]]. As the German princes were experiencing the tumult of the Reformation, the [[German Peasants' War]], and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars against the Ottoman Turks]], they did not enforce the ban on the duke, and agitation against him soon died away.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn imperial politics Albert was fairly active. Joining the [[League of Torgau]] in 1526, he acted in unison with the Protestants, and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the [[Augsburg Interim]] in May 1548. For various reasons, however, poverty and personal inclination among others, he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[File:Albrecht von Brandenburg-Preu\u00dfen Groschen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|One [[Groschen]] coin, 1534, ''[[Epistle to the Galatians|Iustus ex fide vivit]] \u2014 The Just lives on Faith'']]\n\nThe early years of Albert's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court. He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life. In 1544, in spite of some opposition, he founded [[K\u00f6nigsberg University]], where he appointed his friend Andreas Osiander to a professorship in 1549.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical \"[[Prutenic Tables]]\" compiled by [[Erasmus Reinhold]] and the first maps of Prussia by [[Caspar Hennenberger]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOsiander's appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert's reign. Osiander's divergence from Luther's doctrine of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with [[Philip Melanchthon]], who had adherents in K\u00f6nigsberg, and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town. The duke strenuously supported Osiander, and the area of the quarrel soon broadened. There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles, the burden of taxation was heavy, and Albert's rule became unpopular.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAfter Osiander's death in 1552, Albert favoured a preacher named [[Johann Funck]], who, with an adventurer named [[Paul Skali\u0107]], exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense. The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of Albert's early death and the need, should that happen, to appoint a [[regent]], as his only son, [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] was still a mere youth. The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander, and the climax came in 1566 when the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] appealed to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland, Albert's cousin, who sent a commission to K\u00f6nigsberg. Skali\u0107 saved his life by flight, but Funck was executed. The question of the regency was settled, and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[File:Paulus Scalichius (Scaligius, c.1534-1575).png|thumb|170px|Portrait of [[Pavao Skali\u0107]], an [[encyclopedist]], [[Renaissance humanist]] and adventurer from [[Croatia]], who strongly influenced the Duke in the closing years of his reign]]\n\nVirtually deprived of power, the duke lived for two more years, and died at [[Gvardeysk|Tapiau]] on 20 March 1568<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> of the plague, along with his wife. [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]] designed his tomb within [[K\u00f6nigsberg Cathedral]].<ref>M\u00fchlpfordt, p. 73</ref>\n\nAlbert was a voluminous letter writer, and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[File:Dom Fuerstengruft.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Albert by [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]] in [[K\u00f6nigsberg Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Albertus-Schild.jpg|thumb|\"Albertus\" with sword from the [[Silberbibliothek]]]]\nAlthough Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, which would eventually become arguably the most powerful German state and instrumental in uniting the whole of Germany. Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation, and even as indirectly responsible for the [[unification of Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} He was a skilled political administrator and leader, and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order, until he betrayed it by transforming the order's lands into his own duchy, secularizing it in the process.\n\nAlbert was the first German noble to support Luther's ideas and in 1544 founded the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Albertina, as a rival to the Roman Catholic [[Cracow Academy]]. It was the second Lutheran university in the German states, after the [[University of Marburg]].\n\nA [[relief]] of Albert over the Renaissance-era portal of [[K\u00f6nigsberg Castle]]'s southern wing was created by Andreas Hess in 1551 according to plans by Christoph R\u00f6mer.<ref name=\"M90\">M\u00fchlpfordt, p. 90</ref> Another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the Albertina's original campus. This depiction, which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder, was the popular \"Albertus\", the symbol of the university. The original was moved to [[K\u00f6nigsberg Public Library]] to protect it from the elements, while the sculptor [[Paul Kimritz]] created a duplicate for the wall.<ref name=\"M90\"/> Another version of the \"Albertus\" by Lothar Sauer was included at the entrance of the [[K\u00f6nigsberg State and Royal Library]].<ref name=\"M90\"/>\n\nIn 1880 [[Friedrich Reusch]] created a sandstone bust of Albert at the Regierungsgeb\u00e4ude, the administrative building for [[Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6nigsberg]]. On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at [[K\u00f6nigsberg Castle]] with the inscription: \"Albert of Brandenburg, Last Grand Master, First Duke in Prussia\".<ref>M\u00fchlpfordt, p. 82</ref> [[Albert Wolff (sculptor)|Albert Wolff]] also designed an equestrian statue of Albert located at the new campus of the Albertina. [[King's Gate (Kaliningrad)|King's Gate]] contains a statue of Albert.\n\nAlbert was oft-honored in the quarter [[Maraunenhof]] in northern K\u00f6nigsberg. Its main street was named Herzog-Albrecht-Allee in 1906. Its town square, K\u00f6nig-Ottokar-Platz, was renamed Herzog-Albrecht-Platz in 1934 to match its church, the [[Herzog-Albrecht-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche]].<ref>M\u00fchlpfordt, p. 133</ref>\n\n==Spouse and issue==\n[[File:Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia by Cornelis II Floris de Vriendt (Pushkin museum) by shakko 02.jpg|thumb|Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia by [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]]]]\nAlbert married first, to [[Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia|Dorothea]] (1 August 1504{{snd}}11 April 1547), daughter of King [[Frederick I of Denmark]], in 1526.

[[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples<ref>{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}.</ref> who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.\n\nLater, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around 124 AD.

The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the \"Aachener Reich\". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|duke of J\u00fclich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.\n\nAs an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the [[Council of 837]]<ref>{{harvnb|De Jong|1996|p=279}}</ref> and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].<ref name=\"EA\" />\n\n=== Manuscript production ===\nAachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts.

Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit.\n\n==== History of Aachen Jews ====\nDuring the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\" /> In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of [[Charlemagne]] to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today's cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (\u05d0\u05e9).\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Three Country Point, Vaalserberg, April 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Three-Country Point, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet up the [[Vaalserberg]]]]\n\nAachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse\u2013Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country_Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]]. The town of [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands lies nearby at about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre, while the Dutch city of [[Heerlen]] and [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], are both located about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].\n\nThe maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|1|abbr=on}} from east to west.

Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in [[Bonn]] (with 669&nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.<ref name=\"climate\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}.</ref>\n\nBecause the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environmental|2013}}.</ref>\n\nThe January average is\n{{convert|3.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.

The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first= David |year=2012 |title=Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust |issue=367 |volume=367 |publisher=Geological Society of London |isbn=1-86239-347-8 |issn=0305-8719}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.\n\nAlong the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[D\u00fcren]] earthquake<ref name=\"duerenEQ\">{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name=\"Roermond\">{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]\n\nAachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.<ref name=\"Zensus 2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bev\u00f6lkerung im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln |accessdate=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.</ref> At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.<ref name=\"StatJahrbuch2009\">{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.</ref> A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].<ref>{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once \"crowned\" the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Matar\u00e9]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" />\n\n=== Aachen Rathaus ===\n{{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]\nThe Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330,<ref name=\"WB\">{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}</ref> lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.<ref name=\"young2\" />\n\nSince 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-Andr\u00e9-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lef\u00e8vre]] are viewable as part of the tour.\n\nAs before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.\n\n=== Other sights ===\nThe ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the former city hall until the present building took over this function.\n\nThe ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].\n\nAlso of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), half a mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.\n\n[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen Jesuit Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine mannerism and a sample of a local Renaissance-architecture. The rich fa\u00e7ade remained unfinished until 1891 when the historistic architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a Greek Orthodox church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.\n\nThe synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.</ref> One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[J\u00fcrgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.\n\nThere are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others.

The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}</ref> Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).\n\n[[FH Aachen]], [[Aachen University of Applied Sciences]] (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschl\u00fcsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.\n\nThe Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen \u2013 Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia \u2013 Aachen department)<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}</ref> offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}</ref> with one of its three campuses in Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}</ref> The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.\n\nThe [[German Army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.<ref name=\"MeerOpitz1998\">{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Aachen Tivoli under construction.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]\n\nThe annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].\n\nThe local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run-out in Germany's [[Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|\"Tivoli\"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.<ref name=\"GdawietzLeroi2007\">{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}</ref> Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium \"Neuer Tivoli\" \u2013 meaning [[New Tivoli]]\u2014a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.\n\nThe city's biggest tennis club, \"TC Gr\u00fcn Weiss\", annually hosts the ATP Tournament.\n\nThe Ladies in Black women's volleyball team (part of the \"PTSV Aachen\" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Rail ===\nAachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne\u2013Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne\u2013Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen\u2013M\u00f6nchengladbach railway|M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Li\u00e8ge]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.\n\nThere are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].\n\n===Intercity bus stations===\nThere are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe, in the north-east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|title=Aachen: Stations|publisher= Travelinho.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]]\n\nThe first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it was with maximal {{convert|213.5|km|mi}} in 1915 the fourth-longest tram system in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals\u2013Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.\n\nToday, the ASEAG (''Aachener Stra\u00dfenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally \"Aachen tram and power supply company\") operates an {{convert|1240.8|km|mi}} long bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively.\nASEAG is one of the main participants in the [[Aachener Verkehrsverbund]], a tariff association in the region.\n\n=== Roads ===\nAachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (West-East), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.\n\n=== Airport ===\n[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 NM (28&nbsp;km; 17&nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.\n\n== Charlemagne Prize ==\n{{main|Charlemagne Prize}}\n[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]\n\nSince 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].\n\nThe International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an \"Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal\", which was awarded for the only time ever.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of

Michael Hogan. 2007. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian]</ref>\n\n==Formation and characteristics==\n[[File:Agatebots.jpg|thumb|left|Botswana agate]]\nMost agates occur as [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] in [[volcanic]] rocks or ancient [[lava]]s, in former cavities produced by [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] in the original molten mass, which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses. Such agates, when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]], exhibit a succession of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, often of extreme [[wikt:tenuity|tenuity]], giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as ''banded agate'', ''riband agate'' and ''striped agate''.\n\nIn the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing [[silica]] in solution\u2014derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself\u2014percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the [[Vesicular texture|vesicles]]. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of [[chalcedony]] often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]]. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still [[Viscosity|viscous]], and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a [[Brazil]]ian [[geode]] lined with [[amethyst]] and weighing 35&nbsp;tons was exhibited at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf Exhibition]] of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.\n\nThe first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the \"skin\" of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like [[celadonite]], [[delessite]] or \"[[green earth]]\", which are rich in [[iron]] probably derived from the decomposition of the [[augite]] in the enclosing volcanic rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown [[iron oxide]] ([[limonite]]), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer [[Surface science|surface]] of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the \"priming\", and upon this base, [[Zeolite|zeolitic]] minerals may be deposited.\n\nMany agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of [[Druse (geology)|drusy quartz]], sometimes [[amethyst]]ine, having the [[Apex (geometry)|apices]] of the [[crystal]]s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity or geode.\n\nWhen the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates, they are set free. The agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the [[soil]], or are deposited as [[gravel]] in streams and along shorelines.\n\nAgates can also be found in sedimentary rocks.  They need a cavity to form, so they are typically seen in limestone, dolomite, and shale which may have shells, tree branches, or roots in them that later decay away.  With the void created, silica-rich fluids can enter the cavity and precipitate [[chalcedony]] in curved bands forming agates.  Other quartz classes like amethyst or opal may then form the inner-most band inside the [[geode]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geology.com/articles/geodes/|title=Geodes: The rocks with a crystal surprise inside!|website=geology.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\nA Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of ''cyclops agate.'' Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]]. ''Dendritic'' agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance. [[Enhydro agate]] contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.\n\n''Turritella agate'' is formed from silicified [[fossil]] ''[[Elimia tenera]]'' (erroneously considered ''[[Turritella]]'') shells. ''E. tenera'' are spiral freshwater [[gastropod]]s having elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized. Agatized coral is often referred to as [[Petoskey stone]] or agate.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n''Coldwater Agates'' such as the Lake Michigan Cloud Agate, did not form under volcanic processes, and instead formed within the limestone and dolostone bedrock of ancient oceans. Like volcanic-origin agates, ''Coldwater Agates\" formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock. These agates are typically less colorful, with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brays|first1=Karen|title=Customer Agate Finds|url=http://agatelady.com/photo-gallery-customer-agate-finds.html|website=Gitche Gumee Museum|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Greek agate'' is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in [[Sicily]] back to 400 BC. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads. Even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the Sumerians and the Egyptians, both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, any agate of this color from Sicily, once an ancient Greek colony, is called Greek agate.\n\n''Brazilian agate'' is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.\n\nCertain stones, when examined in [[thin section]]s by transmitted light, show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed ''rainbow agates''. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.\n\n''Lace agate'' is a variety that exhibits a [[lace]]-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags (if these predominate, it is called ''lattice agate''). ''Crazy lace agate'', found in Mexico, is often brightly colored and complexly patterned.

It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for [[laboratory balance]]s and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for [[leather burnishing]] tools.\n\nThe decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as [[pins]], [[brooch]]es or other types of [[jewellery]], paper knives, [[inkstand]]s, [[marbles]] and [[seal (emblem)|seals]]. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and [[Intarsia]] art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. [[Idar-Oberstein]] was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe.<ref>[http://www.farlang.com/art/2007-04-15.7721093142 Background Article on Idar Oberstein]</ref> Agates have long been used in arts and crafts.

Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme ([[Suicide inhibition]]). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.\n\nLow-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8\u20139 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in heart attack and stroke prevention |access-date=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archive-date=31 March 2008 }}</ref> 40&nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tohgi H, Konno S, Tamura K, Kimura B, Kawano K | title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin | journal = Stroke | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1400\u20133 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1412574 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400 }}</ref>\n\nProstaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.\n\n===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===\nAt least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goel A, Aggarwal S, Partap S, Saurabh A, Choudhary | title = Pharmacokinetic solubility and dissolution profile of antiarrythmic drugs. | journal = Int J Pharma Prof Res | date = 2012 | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 592\u2013601 }}</ref>{{vn|date=August 2016}} Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.<ref name=COX2002/>\n\nHowever, several of the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez J, Badimon L | title = Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 13 | issue = 22 | pages = 2215\u201327 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17691994 | doi = 10.2174/138161207781368774 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Funk CD, FitzGerald GA | title = COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 470\u20139 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18030055 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d }}</ref> Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.\n\nFurthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the [[prostaglandins]], converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a [[lipoxygenase]]-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to [[specialized proresolving mediators]] such as the aspirin-triggered [[lipoxin]]s, aspirin-triggered [[resolvins]], and aspirin-triggered [[maresin]]s.  These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.<ref name=\"pmid25895638\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cianci E, Simiele F, Recchiuti A | title = Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins in resolution of inflammation | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 760 | issue =  | pages = 49\u201363 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25895638 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.083 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23747022\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N | title = Resolution phase lipid mediators of inflammation: agonists of resolution | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 632\u201340 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23747022 | pmc = 3732499 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.05.012 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid26546723\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 785 | issue =  | pages = 108\u2013115 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 }}</ref>\n\n===Additional mechanisms===\nAspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action.

If the consuming public had once learned to know 'Aspirin' as the accepted name for the drug, perhaps it is true that an extended course of education might have added to it some proprietary meaning, but it would be very difficult to prove that it had been done in 17 months, and in any case the plaintiff does not try to prove it. [...] Yet, had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer, it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915. Nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiff's name, or to take over the sale just as it did later. Instead of this, they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trademark. Having made that bed, they must be content to lie in it.

He then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced [[David (biblical king)|David]] to Saul following David's killing of [[Goliath]]. He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous [[battle of Gilboa]] when Saul's power was crushed. Seizing the youngest but only surviving of Saul's sons, [[Ish-bosheth]], Abner set him up as king over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]] at [[Mahanaim]], east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]]. [[David (biblical king)|David]], who was accepted as king by [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] alone, was meanwhile reigning at [[Hebron]], and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abner|volume=1|page=66}}</ref>\n\nThe only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2 Samuel 2:12).{{efn|According to Chisholm (1911), [t]he object of the story of the encounter is to explain the name Helkath-hazzurim, the meaning of which is doubtful (''Ency. Bib.'' col. 2006; Batten in ''Zeit. f. alt-test. Wissens.'' 1906, pp. 90 sqq.).}} In the general engagement which followed, Abner was defeated and put to flight. He was closely pursued by [[Asahel]], brother of [[Joab]], who is said to have been \"light of foot as a wild roe\" (2 Samuel 2:18). As Asahel would not desist from the pursuit, though warned, Abner was compelled to slay him in self-defence. This originated a deadly [[feud]] between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self-defense. This battle was part of a civil war between David and Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul. After this battle Abner switched to the side of David and granted him control over the tribe of Benjamin. This act put Abner in David's favor. The real reason that Joab killed Abner was that he became a threat to his rank of general. He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.\n\nFor some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of David. At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing Abner of sleeping with [[Rizpah]] (cf. 2 Samuel 3:7), one of Saul's [[concubine]]s, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the [[throne]] (cf. 2 Samuel 16:21ff.).\n\nAbner was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with David, who welcomed him on the condition that his wife [[Michal]] should be restored to him. This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast. Almost immediately after, however, Joab, who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew Abner at the gate of Hebron. The ostensible motive for the [[assassination]] was a desire to avenge Asahel, and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time. The conduct of David after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2 Samuel 3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n[[File:David and the tomb of Abner.jpg|thumb|David and the tomb of Abner.

His mother was [[Handan Sultan]]. After his grandfather [[Murad III]]'s death in 1595, his father came to Constantinople and ascended the throne as Sultan [[Mehmed III]].  Mehmed ordered the execution of nineteen of his own brothers and half brothers. Ahmed's elder brother [[\u015eehzade Mahmud (son of Mehmed III)|\u015eehzade Mahmud]] was also executed by his father Mehmed on 7 June 1603, just before Mehmed's own death on 22 December 1603. Mahmud was buried along with his mother in a separate mausoleum built by Ahmed in [[\u015eehzade Mosque]], Constantinople.\n\n==Reign==\nAhmed ascended the throne after his father's death in 1603, at the age of thirteen, when his powerful grandmother [[Safiye Sultan]] was still alive. A far lost uncle of Ahmed, [[Sultan Yahya|Yahya]], resented his accession to the throne and spent his life scheming to become Sultan. Ahmed broke with the traditional fratricide following previous enthronements and did not order the execution of his brother [[Mustafa I|Mustafa]]. Instead Mustafa was sent to live at the old palace at Bayezit along with their grandmother Safiye Sultan. This was most likely due to Ahmed's young age - he had not yet demonstrated his ability to sire children, and Mustafa was then the only other candidate for the Ottoman throne. His brother's execution would have endangered the dynasty, and thus he was spared.<ref name=\"Peirce 1993 99\"/>\n\nIn the earlier part of his reign Ahmed I showed decision and vigor, which were belied by his subsequent conduct.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The wars in [[Ottoman Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Safavid Dynasty|Persia]], which attended his accession, terminated unfavourably for the empire. Its prestige was further tarnished in the [[Treaty of Sitvatorok|Treaty of Zsitvatorok]], signed in 1606, whereby the annual tribute paid by [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] was abolished. Following the crushing defeat in the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1603\u201318)]] against the neighbouring rivals [[Safavid Empire]], led by Shah [[Abbas the Great]], Georgia, Azerbaijan and other vast territories in the Caucasus were ceded back to Persia per the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha]] in 1612, territories that had been temporarily conquered in the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u201390)]].

Upon ascending the throne, Ahmed I appointed [[Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha]] as the commander of the eastern army. The army marched from Constantinople on 15 June 1604, which was too late, and by the time it had arrived on the eastern front on 8 November 1604, the [[Safavid]] army had captured [[Yerevan]] and entered the [[Kars Eyalet]], and could only be stopped in [[Akhaltsikhe]]. Despite the conditions being favourable, Sinan Pasha decided to stay for the winter in [[Van, Turkey|Van]], but then marched to [[Erzurum]] to stop an incoming Safavid attack. This caused unrest within the army and the year was practically wasted for the Ottomans.<ref name=islamans>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/pdf/c02/c020017.pdf| title=Ahmed I |encyclopedia=\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi |publisher=T\u00fcrk Diyanet Vakf\u0131 |pages=30\u201333 |year=1989 | volume=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1605, Sinan Pasha marched to take [[Tabriz]], but the army was undermined by [[K\u00f6se Sefer Pasha]], the [[Beylerbey]] of Erzurum, marching independently from Sinan Pasha and consequently being taken prisoner by the Safavids. The Ottoman army was routed at [[Battle of Urmia (1604)|Urmia]] and had to flee firstly to Van and then to [[Diyarbak\u0131r|Diyarbekir]]. Here, Sinan Pasha sparked a rebellion by executing the Beylerbey of [[Aleppo]], [[Canbulato\u011flu H\u00fcseyin Pasha]], who had come to provide help, upon the pretext that he had arrived too late. He soon died himself and the Safavid army was able to capture [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Shirvan]] and [[Shamakhi]] in Azerbaijan.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== War with the Habsburgs: 1604\u201306 ===\nThe [[Long Turkish War]] between the Ottomans and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] had been going on for over a decade by the time Ahmed ascended the throne.  Grand Vizier [[Malko\u00e7 Ali Pasha]] marched to the western front from Constantinople on 3 June 1604 and arrived in [[Belgrade]], but died there, so [[Lala Mehmed Pasha]] was appointed as the Grand Vizier and the commander of the western army. Under Mehmed Pasha, the western army recaptured [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[V\u00e1c]], but failed to capture [[Esztergom]] as the siege was lifted due to unfavourable weather and the objections of the soldiers. Meanwhile, the Prince of [[Transylvania]], [[Stephen Bocskay]], who struggled for the region's independence and had formerly supported the Habsburgs, sent a messenger to the Porte asking for help. Upon the promise of help, his forces also joined the Ottoman forces in Belgrade. With this help, the Ottoman army besieged Esztergom and captured it on 4 November 1605. Bocskai, with Ottoman help, captured [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]] (Uyvar) and forces under [[Tiryaki Hasan Pasha]] took [[Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[V\u00e1rpalota|Palota]]. [[Sarho\u015f \u0130brahim Pasha]], the Beylerbey of [[Nagykanizsa]] (Kanije), attacked the Austrian region of [[Istria]].<ref name=islamans/>\n\nHowever, with Jelali revolts in Anatolia more dangerous than ever and a defeat in the eastern front, Mehmed Pasha was called to Constantinople. Mehmed Pasha suddenly died there, whilst preparing to leave for the east. [[Kuyucu Murad Pasha]] then negotiated the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]], which abolished the tribute of 30,000 ducats paid by Austria and addressed the Habsburg emperor as the equal of the Ottoman sultan. The Jelali revolts were a strong factor in the Ottomans' acceptance of the terms. This signaled the end of Ottoman growth in Europe.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Jelali revolts ===\nResentment over the war with the Habsburgs and heavy taxation, along with the weakness of the Ottoman military response, combined to make the reign of Ahmed I the zenith of the [[Jelali revolts]]. Tavil Ahmed launched a revolt soon after the coronation of Ahmed I and defeated [[Nasuh Pasha]] and the Beylerbey of Anatolia, Kecdehan Ali Pasha. In 1605, Tavil Ahmed was offered the position of the Beylerbey of [[Shahrizor]] to stop his rebellion, but soon afterwards he went on to capture [[Harput]]. His son, Mehmed, obtained the governorship of [[Baghdad]] with a fake [[firman]] and defeated the forces of Nasuh Pasha sent to defeat him.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nMeanwhile, Canbulato\u011flu Ali Pasha united his forces with the [[Druze]] Sheikh Ma'no\u011flu Fahreddin to defeat the Amir of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Seyfo\u011flu Yusuf. He went on to take control of the [[Adana]] area, forming an army and issuing coins. His forces routed the army of the newly appointed Beylerbey of Aleppo, H\u00fcseyin Pasha. Grand Vizier [[Bo\u015fnak Dervish Mehmed Pasha]] was executed for the weakness he showed against the Jelalis. He was replaced by Kuyucu Murad Pasha, who marched to Syria with his forces to defeat the 30,000-strong rebel army with great difficulty, albeit with a decisive result, on 24 October 1607. Meanwhile, he pretended to forgive the rebels in Anatolia and appointed the rebel Kalendero\u011flu, who was active in [[Manisa]] and [[Bursa]], as the [[sanjakbey]] of [[Ankara]]. Baghdad was recaptured in 1607 as well. Canbulato\u011flu Ali Pasha fled to Constantinople and asked for forgiveness from Ahmed I, who appointed him to [[Timi\u015foara]] and later Belgrade, but then executed him due to his misrule there. Meanwhile, Kalendero\u011flu was not allowed in the city by the people of Ankara and rebelled again, only to be crushed by Murad Pasha's forces. Kalendero\u011flu ended up fleeing to Persia. Murad Pasha then suppressed some smaller revolts in Central Anatolia and suppressed other Jelali chiefs by inviting them to join the army.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nDue to the widespread violence of the Jelali revolts, a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed. Some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property. This deprived the Porte of tax income and on 30 September 1609, Ahmed I issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers. He then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Ottoman-Safavid War: Peace and continuation ===\n[[File:Savary Franco Ottoman Capitulations 1615.jpg|thumb|200px|Bilingual Franco-Turkish translation of the 1604 [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman Capitulations]] between Ahmed I and [[Henry IV of France]], published by [[Fran\u00e7ois Savary de Br\u00e8ves]] in 1615<ref name=\"Bosworth\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA799 |title='&#39;The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'&#39; by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>]]\n\nThe new Grand Vizier, Nasuh Pasha, did not want to fight with the Safavids. The Safavid Shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace, with which he would have to send 200 loads of [[silk]] every year to Constantinople. On 20 November 1612, the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha]] was signed, which ceded all the lands the Ottoman Empire had gained in the war of 1578\u201390 back to Persia and reinstated the 1555 boundaries.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nHowever, the peace ended in 1615 when the Shah did not send the 200 loads of silk. On 22 May 1615, Grand Vizier [[\u00d6k\u00fcz Mehmed Pasha]] was assigned to organize an attack on Persia. Mehmed Pasha delayed the attack till the next year, until when the Safavids made their preparations and attacked Ganja. In April 1616, Mehmed Pasha left Aleppo with a large army and marched to Yerevan, where he failed to take the city and withdrew to Erzurum. He was removed from his post and replaced by [[Damat Halil Pasha]]. Halil Pasha went for the winter to Diyarbekir, while the Khan of Crimea, [[Canibek Giray]], attacked the areas of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhichevan]] and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]].<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Capitulations and trade treaties ===\nAhmed I renewed trade treaties with England, France and Venice. In July 1612, the first ever trade treaty with the [[Dutch Republic]] was signed. He expanded the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]] given to France, specifying that merchants from [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Ancona]] and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Florence]] could trade under the French flag.<ref name=islamans/>\n\n=== Architect and service to Islam ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Madina trip 200.jpg|thumb|Ahmed I plate at MAsjid al-Nabawi marking Bab al-Tawba]]\n\n\nSultan Ahmed constructed the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, the magnum opus of the Ottoman architecture,{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} across from the [[Hagia Sophia]]. The sultan attended the breaking of the ground with a golden pickaxe to begin the construction of the mosque complex. An incident nearly broke out after the sultan discovered that the Blue Mosque contained the same number of minarets as the grand mosque of Mecca. Ahmed became furious at this fault and became remorseful until the Shaykh-ul-Islam recommended that he should erect another minaret at the grand mosque of Mecca and the matter was solved.\n\n[[File:Blue Mosque.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]]]]\n\nAhmed became delightedly involved in the eleventh comprehensive renovations of the [[Kaaba]], which had just been damaged by flooding. He sent craftsmen from Constantinople, and the golden rain gutter that kept rain from collecting on the roof of the Ka\u2019ba was successfully renewed. It was again during the era of Sultan Ahmed that an iron web was placed inside the [[Zamzam Well]] in Mecca. The placement of this web about three feet below the water level was a response to lunatics who jumped into the well, imagining a promise of a heroic death.\n\nIn Medina, the city of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], a new pulpit made of white marble and shipped from Istanbul arrived in the mosque of the prophet and substituted the old, worn-out pulpit. It is also known that Sultan Ahmed erected two more mosques in Uskudar on the Asian side of Istanbul; however, neither of them has survived.\n\nThe sultan had a crest carved with the footprint of Muhammad that he would wear on Fridays and festive days and illustrated one of the most significant examples of affection to the prophet in Ottoman history. Engraved inside the crest was a poem he composed:\n{{quote|\u201cIf only could I bear over my head like my turban forever thee, If only I could carry it all the time with me, on my head like a crown, the Footprint of the Prophet Muhammad, which has a beautiful complexion, Ahmed, go on, rub your face on the feet of that rose.\u201c}}\n\n==Character==\nSultan Ahmed was known for his skills in fencing, poetry, horseback riding, and fluency in several languages.\n\nAhmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name Bahti. But while supportive of poetry, he displayed an aversion to artistry and continued his father's neglect of [[Ottoman miniature|miniature painting]]. {{Citation needed|reason=\"Works of fiction are not reliable sources, no matter how excellent\"|date=December 2013}} This was connected to a devout religiosity that declared depiction of living things in art an immoral rivalry to [[Allah]]'s creation.<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref> Accordingly, Ahmed patronized scholars, calligraphers, and pious men. Hence he commissioned a book entitled ''The Quintessence of Histories'' to be worked upon by calligraphers.

Ahmed II was born at [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Constantinople]], the son of Sultan [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]] (1640&ndash;48) by [[Muazzez Sultan]], and succeeded his brother [[Suleiman II]] (1687&ndash;91) in 1691.\n\n== Early life ==\nAhmed II was born on 25 February 1643, the son of Sultan [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]] and [[Muazzez Sultan]]. During the reigns of his older brothers, Ahmed was imprisoned in [[Kafes]], and he stayed there almost 43 years.\n\n==Reign==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nDuring his short reign, Sultan Ahmed II devoted most of his attention to the wars against the Habsburgs and related foreign policy, governmental and economic issues. Of these, the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system (malikane) (see [[tax farming]]). Following the recovery of Belgrade under his predecessor, [[Suleiman II]], the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the Danube, with the Habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it, and the Ottomans attempting, ultimately unsuccessfully, to regain the initiative north of it.\n\nAmong the most important features of Ahmed's reign was his reliance on [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha]]. Following his accession to the throne, Sultan Ahmed II confirmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha in his office as grand vizier. In office from 1689, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha was from the famous K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family of grand viziers, and like most of his K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc predecessors in the same office, was an able administrator and military commander. Like his father K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha (grand vizier 1656\u201361) before him, he ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself. He overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars. He also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the Balkans and Anatolia. In October 1690 he recaptured Belgrade (northern Serbia), a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers Danube and Sava; in Ottoman hands since 1521, the fortress had been conquered by the Habsburgs in 1688.\n\nFaz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's victory at Belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the Ottomans hope that the military debacles of the 1680s\u2014which had led to the loss of Hungary and Transylvania, an Ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro-Istanbul Hungarian princes\u2014 could be reversed. However, the Ottoman success proved ephemeral. On 19 August 1691, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha suffered a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] (northwest of Belgrade) at the hands of Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden, the Habsburg commander in chief in Hungary, fittingly nicknamed \u201cT\u00fcrkenlouis\u201d (Louis the Turk) for his victories against the Ottomans. In the confrontation, recognized by contemporaries as \u201cthe bloodiest battle of the century,\u201d the Ottomans suffered heavy losses: 20,000 men, including the grand vizier. With him, the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family, who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the Ottoman military.\n\nUnder Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's successors, the Ottomans suffered further defeats. In June 1692 the Habsburgs conquered V\u00e1rad (Oradea, Romania), the seat of an Ottoman governor (beylerbeyi) since 1660. In 1694 they attempted to recapture V\u00e1rad, but to no avail. On 12 January 1695, they surrendered the fortress of Gyula, the center of an Ottoman sanjak or subprovince since 1566.

He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (1682\u20131718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of [[Peter I of Russia]] (1672\u20131725) in the [[Battle of Poltava]] of 1709.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under [[Baltac\u0131 Mehmet Pasha]] won a major victory at the [[Pruth River Campaign|Battle of Prut]]. In the aftermath, Russia returned [[Azov]] back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of [[Taganrog]] and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\nForced against his will into war with Russia, Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his [[grand vizier]] [[Nev\u015fehirli Damat \u0130brahim Pasha]] succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached [[Istanbul]] that the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.\n\nSultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen [[Janissaries]], led by the [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Patrona Halil]], was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.\n\nAhmed voluntarily led his nephew [[Mahmud I]] (1730\u201354) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the [[Kafes]] previously occupied by Mahmud and died at [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] after six years of confinement.\n\n== Ahmed III's rule ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 006.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III receives French ambassador Vicomte d'Andrezel at [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].]]\n[[File:Marquis de Bonnac being received by Sultan Ahmed III.jpg|thumb|French ambassador [[Marquis de Bonnac]] being received by Sultan Ahmed III.]]\n[[File:Ahmet III 1720.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III at a reception, painted in 1720]]\nThe reign of Ahmed III lasted for twenty-seven years and was not unsuccessful. The recovery of [[Azov]] and the [[Morea]], and the conquest of part of [[Persia]], managed to counterbalance the [[Balkans|Balkan]] territory ceded to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318]]. In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture [[Corfu]] from the [[Republic of Venice]] but that expedition eventually failed,\n\nAhmed III left the finances of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated [[Patronage|patron]] of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first [[printing press]] authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Istanbul, operated by [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).\n[[File:Levni 002 detail.jpg|thumb|A [[Portrait miniature|miniature]] of Sultan Ahmed III by [[Abdulcelil Levni|Levni]]]]\nIt was in this reign that an important change in the government of the [[Danubian Principalities]] was introduced: previously, the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] had appointed [[Hospodar]]s, usually native [[Moldavia]]n and [[Wallachia]]n [[boyar]]s, to administer those provinces; after the [[Pruth River Campaign|Russian campaign]] of 1711, during which [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] found an ally in [[Moldavia]] [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the Porte began overtly deputizing [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Greeks]] in that region, and extended the system to [[Wallachia]] after [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Stefan Cantacuzino]] established links with [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive.

No attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a [[language isolate]].<ref name=shibatani />\n\nWords used as prepositions in English (such as ''to'', ''from'', ''by'', ''in'', and ''at'') are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or [[agglutinate]]d sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.\n\nThe Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese [[kana]] or [[Russian alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]]. Today, it is typically written in either [[katakana]] or [[Latin alphabet]]. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent [[syllable coda|coda]] consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu. For example, some words, such as ''Kor'' (meaning \"to hold\"), are now pronounced with a [[paragoge]], as in ''Koro''.\n\nMany of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the [[Yukar]], or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ainu.htm |title=Ainu |website=omniglot.com |year=2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref><!--ethnologue data is incorrect; see [[ainu language]]-->\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main article|Ainu cuisine|Ainu music|Yukar|}}\n{{Update-EB |section=y|date=November 2016}}\n{{Expand Japanese|\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6587\u5316|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Woman playing traditional Ainu instrument.jpg|thumb|left|Woman playing a [[tonkori]]]]\n[[File:Ainu ceremonial dress.jpg|thumb|left|Ainu ceremonial dress, [[British Museum]]]]\nTraditional Ainu culture was quite different from [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]].

Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.\n\n''Cise'' or ''cisey'' (houses) in a kotan were made of [[cogon grasses]], [[bamboo grass]], [[bark (biology)|bark]]s, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the \"rorun-puyar,\" a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''sintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.\n\nOutbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a \"heper set\" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar''). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as ''[[Iyomante]]'', a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PSM V33 D514 Ainu houses.jpg|Ainu houses (from ''Popular Science Monthly Volume 33'', 1888)\nFile:PSM V33 D517 Plan of an ainu house.jpg|Plan of an Ainu house\nFile:Ainu traditional house\u201dcise\u201d3.jpg|The family would gather around the fireplace.<!--Hokkaido Foundation for History and Culture-->\nFile:National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka - Interior of the house of Ainu - Saru River basin, Hokkaid\u00f4.jpg|Interior of the house of Ainu - [[Saru River]] basin\n</gallery>\n\n===Traditions===\nThe Ainu people had various types of marriage.

An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]].

He became the first true hero of Rome. [[Snorri Sturluson]] identifies him with the Norse [[\u00c6sir]] [[Vidarr]].<ref>The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916] Prologue II at Internet Sacred Texts Archive.

In the Homeric Hymn to [[Aphrodite]], Aeneas is first introduced with Aphrodite naming him \u0391\u1f30\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (''Aine\u00edas'') for the \u03b1\u1f76\u03bd\u00f3\u03bd \u1f04\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (\"terrible grief\") he caused her, where ''Aine\u00edas'' derives from the adjective \u03b1\u1f76\u03bd\u00f3\u03bd (''ainon'', meaning \"terrible\").<ref>Gregory Nagy (Translator), ''[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/aphrodite.html#_ftn18 Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]'' 198-199: \"His name will be Aineias [Aeneas], since it was an unspeakable [ainos] ''akhos'' that took hold of me\u2014grief that I had fallen into the bed of a mortal man.\"</ref> It is a popular etymology for the name, apparently exploited by Homer in the Iliad.<ref>Andrew Faulkner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VuATDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA257&dq=aeneas%20etymology&pg=PA257#v=onepage&q&f=false The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: Introduction, Text, and Commentary]'' (2008) p.257</ref> Later in the Medieval period there were writers who held that, because the Aeneid was written by a philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically.<ref>Marilynn Desmond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2b1qK94kbgIC&lpg=PA86&dq=aeneas%20etymology%20ennos%20demas&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false Reading Dido: Gender, Textuality, and Medieval Aeneid]'' (1994) pp. 85-86</ref> As such, in the \"natural order\", the meaning of Aeneas' name combines Greek ''ennos'' (\"dweller\") and ''demas'' (\"body\"), which becomes ''ennaios'', meaning \"in-dweller\" (i.e. as a god inhabiting a mortal body).<ref>[[John of Salisbury]], ''Polycraticus'' 8.24-25; [[Bernardus Silvestris|Bernard Sylvestris of Tours]], ''Commentum supra sex libros Eneidos Vergilii''</ref> However, there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name.\n\n===Epithets===\nIn imitation of the ''Iliad'', Virgil borrows epithets of Homer, including; Anchisiades, ''magnanimum'', ''magnus'', ''heros'', and ''bonus''. Though he borrows many, Virgil gives Aeneas two epithets of his own in the ''Aeneid:'' ''pater'' and ''pius''. The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is ''poikilios'' (\"wily\"), Aeneas is described as ''pius'' (\"pious\"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of Aeneas' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seem circumstantial: when Aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission. Likewise, Aeneas is called ''pater'' when acting in the interest of his men.<ref>Milman Parry (Author), Adam Parry (Editor), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cbvyswUgSnEC&lpg=PA169&ots=9KObiMHxbR&dq=aeneas%20epithets&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry]'' (1971) p.169</ref>\n\n==Greek myth and epos==\n\n===Homeric ''Hymn to Aphrodite''===\n[[File:William Blake Richmond - Venus and Anchises - Google Art Project.jpg|Painting ''Venus and Anchises'' by [[William Blake Richmond]] (1889 or 90)|thumb|400px]]\n\nThe story of the birth of Aeneas is told in the \"Hymn to Aphrodite\", one of the major [[Homeric Hymns]]. Aphrodite has caused [[Zeus]] to fall in love with mortal women. In retaliation, Zeus puts desire in her heart for Anchises, who is tending his cattle among the hills near [[Mount Ida]]. When Aphrodite sees him she is smitten. She adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him. He is overcome by her beauty, believing that she is a goddess, but Aphrodite identifies herself as a [[Phrygia]]n princess. After they make love, Aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and Anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison. Aphrodite assures him that he will be protected, and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called Aeneas. However, she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess. When Aeneas is born, Aphrodite takes him to the [[nymph]]s of Mount Ida. She directs them to raise the child to age five, then take him to Anchises.<ref>\"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.\" trans by Gregory Nagy, University of Houston.</ref> According to other sources, Anchises later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus. Thereafter he is lame in that foot, so that Aeneas has to carry him from the flames of Troy.<ref>Virgil, ''The Aeneid''</ref>\n\n===Homer's ''Iliad''===\n[[File:Aineias Ankhises Louvre F118.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Aeneas carrying [[Anchises]], black-figured [[oinochoe]], ca. 520\u2013510 BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]] (F 118)]]\nAeneas is a minor character in the ''[[Iliad]]'', where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as-yet-unknown destiny, but is an honorable warrior in his own right.

Aeneas's mother [[Aphrodite]] frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield, and he is a favorite of [[Apollo]]. Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with [[Diomedes]] of [[Argos]], who nearly kills him, and carry him away to [[Pergamos]] for healing. Even [[Poseidon]], who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue after he falls under the assault of [[Achilles]], noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people.

The Aeneads included Aeneas's trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]], and [[Acmon, the Aenead|Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], the helmsman [[Palinurus]], and his son [[Ascanius]] (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius). He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.\n\nSeveral attempts to find a new home failed; one such stop was on [[Sicily]], where in [[Trapani|Drepanum]], on the island's western coast, his father, Anchises, died peacefully.\n\n[[File:Gu\u00e9rin \u00c9n\u00e9e racontant \u00e0 Didon les malheurs de la ville de Troie Louvre 5184.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by [[Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\n\nAfter a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]] after six years of wanderings.  Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the [[Punic Wars]]. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.\n\nAfter the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.\n\n[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Aeneas defeats [[Turnus]], by [[Luca Giordano]], 1634\u20131705. The ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of Aeneas is shown ascendant, looking into the light of the future, while that of Turnus is setting, shrouded in darkness]]\n\n[[Latinus]], king of the Latins, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled Trojans and let them reorganize their lives in [[Latium]]. His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land &mdash; namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King [[Mezentius]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the Latins. Aeneas's forces prevailed. Turnus was killed, and Virgil's account ends abruptly.\n\n===Other sources===\nThe rest of Aeneas's biography is gleaned from other ancient sources, including Livy and Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. After Aeneas's death, Venus asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed. The river god [[Numicus]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god [[Jupiter Indiges]].<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy01.html Titus Livius. ''The History of Rome'', (Rev. Canon Roberts, trans.), Vol. I, J. M.

The 12th-century French ''[[Roman d'En\u00e9as]]'' addresses Aeneas's sexuality. Though Virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto [[Nisus and Euryalus]], making his Aeneas a purely heterosexual character, in the Middle Ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in Aeneas. The ''Roman d'En\u00e9as'' addresses that charge, when [[Amata|Queen Amata]] opposes Aeneas's marrying [[Lavinia]], claiming that Aeneas loved boys.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eldevik|first=Randi|year=1991|title=Negotiations of Homoerotic Tradition|journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association|PMLA]]|volume=106|issue=5|pages=1177\u201378|jstor=462692|doi=10.2307/462692}}</ref>\n\nMedieval interpretations of Aeneas were greatly influenced by both Virgil and other Latin sources. Specifically, the accounts by Dares and Dictys, which were reworked by 13th-century Italian writer [[Guido delle Colonne]] (in ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]''), colored many later readings. From Guido, for instance, the [[Pearl Poet]] and other English writers get the suggestion<ref name=tolkien/> that Aeneas's safe departure from Troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason, for which he was chastised by [[Hecuba]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Colonne|first=Guido delle|authorlink=Guido delle Colonne|editor=Griffin, N.

Le Guin]]'s ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'', a re-telling of the last six books of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' told from the point of view of [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]] of [[Latium]].\n\nAeneas appears in [[David Gemmell]]'s ''Troy'' series as a main heroic character who goes by the name [[Helikaon]].\n\nIn [[Rick Riordan]]'s book series, ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', Aeneas is regarded as the first Roman demigod, son of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] rather than Aphrodite.\n\n===Opera, film and other media===\nAeneas is a title character in [[Henry Purcell]]'s opera ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (c. 1688), and one of the principal roles in [[Hector Berlioz]]' opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (c. 1857). Canadian composer [[James Rolfe (composer)|James Rolfe]] composed his opera ''Aeneas and Dido'' (2007; to a libretto by [[Andr\u00e9 Alexis]]) as a companion piece to Purcell's opera.\n\nDespite its many dramatic elements, Aeneas's story has generated little interest from the film industry. Portrayed by [[Steve Reeves]], he was the main character in the 1961 [[sword and sandal]] film ''[[Guerra di Troia]]'' (''The Trojan War'').  Reeves reprised the role the following year in the film ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]'', about Aeneas's arrival in [[Latium]] and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow Trojan refugees there.\n\nThe most recent cinematic portrayal of Aeneas was in the film ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', in which he appears as a youth charged by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to protect the Trojan refugees, and to continue the ideals of the city and its people. Paris gives Aeneas Priam's sword, in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of Troy \u2013 and lay the foundations of Roman culture. In this film, he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war.\n\nIn the role-playing game ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'' by White Wolf Game Studios, Aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the [[Ventrue Clan]].\n\nin the action game ''[[Warriors: Legends of Troy]]'', Aeneas is a playable character. The game ends with him and the Aeneans fleeing Troy's destruction and, spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed, goes to a new country (Italy) where he will start an empire greater than Greece and Troy combined that shall rule the world for 1000 years, never to be outdone in the tale of men (The Roman Empire).\n\nIn the 2018 TV miniseries ''[[Troy: Fall of a City]]'', Aeneas is portrayed by [[Alfred Enoch]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/troy-fall-of-a-city-cast-bella-dayne-louis-hunter-joseph-mawle-frances-oconnor-david-threlfall-bbc-netflix-1202055633/|title=\u2018Troy: Fall Of A City\u2019: Bella Dayne, Louis Hunter & More Join BBC/Netflix Epic|date=March 30, 2017|publisher=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Depictions in art==\nScenes depicting Aeneas, especially from the Aeneid, have been the focus of study for centuries.

Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning \"joy\" in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the name of which means \"left side of the hummingbird\" or \"hummingbird left-hand\" (Real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.\n\nBecause of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are not grasses and are called [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.\n\n=== Seed ===\nSeveral species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|\"grain\"]] in Asia and the Americas.\n\nAncient amaranth grains still used include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.<ref>Costea et al.

To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}</ref>\n -->\n\n=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===\n\nAmaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world.

In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chili, and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial''.  In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.\n\nIn China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau d\u1ec1n}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n \u0111\u1ecf}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n c\u01a1m}} or {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n tr\u1eafng}} (''Amaranthus viridis'').\n\nA traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&page=35 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''.<ref>{{cite book  | author=Goode, P.

It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish.

This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.<ref>Wetzel et al.

In old versions of the story, the scene of the murder, when it is specified, is usually the house of Aegisthus, who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon's palace, and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon's followers as well.<ref>Aeschylus (1986), ''Choephori''; introduction by A.

P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 8.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Atreus]], Agamemnon's father, murdered the sons of his twin brother [[Thyestes]] and fed them to Thyestes after discovering Thyestes' [[adultery]] with his wife Aerope. Thyestes fathered [[Aegisthus]] with his own daughter, [[Pelopia (daughter of Thyestes)|Pelopia]], and this son vowed gruesome revenge on Atreus' children. Aegisthus successfully murdered Atreus and restored his father to the throne. Aegisthus took possession of the throne of Mycenae and jointly ruled with Thyestes. During this period, Agamemnon and his brother, [[Menelaus]], took refuge with [[Tyndareus]], King of [[Sparta]]. There they respectively married Tyndareus' daughters [[Clytemnestra]] and Helen. Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: one son, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], and three daughters, [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta, while Agamemnon, with his brother's assistance, drove out Aegisthus and Thyestes to recover his father's kingdom. He extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in Greece.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAgamemnon's family history had been tarnished by [[murder]], [[incest]], and [[Betrayal|treachery]], consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor, [[Tantalus]], and then of a curse placed upon [[Pelops]], son of [[Tantalus]], by [[Myrtilus]], whom he had murdered. Thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the [[House of Atreus]], until atoned by [[Orestes]] in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods.\n\n== Trojan War ==\n{{Main article|Trojan War}}\nAgamemnon gathered the reluctant Greek forces to sail for [[Troy]]. Preparing to depart from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], which was a port in [[Boeotia]], Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]]. There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in [[Aeschylus]]' play ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter [[Iphigenia]].\n\n[[File:Achilles Briseis MAN Napoli Inv9105 n01.jpg|thumb|[[Achilles]]' surrender of [[Briseis]] to Agamemnon, from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD, now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]\n\nClassical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate; some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to [[Achilles]], but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the [[human sacrifice]] have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', say that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to [[Tauris]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].\n\nAgamemnon was the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]] and fifteen other Trojan soldiers, according to one source.<ref>[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 114.</ref> But in the \"[[Iliad]]\" itself, he's shown to slaughter hundreds more in Book 11 during his \"aristea\" loosely translated to \"day of glory\" which is the most similar to Achilles' \"aristea\" in Book 21 (they both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle, their hands are described as \"splattered with gore\" and \"invincible,\" the Trojans flee to the walls, they both are appealed to by one of their victims, they are both avoided by Hector, they both get wounded in the arm or hand, and they both kill the one who wounded them). Even before his \"aristea,\" Agamemnon was considered to be one of the three best warriors on the Greek side as proven when Hector challenges any champion of the Greek side to fight him in Book 7, and Agamemnon (along with Diomedes and Big Aias) is one of the three most wished for to face him out of the nine strongest Greek warriors who volunteered. And after they reconciled, even Achilles admits in Book 23 that Agamemnon is \"the best in strength and in throwing the spear.\" That claim is further proven by the fact that Agamemnon was the only major warrior on either side to never need the gods' direct intervention to increase his strength or give him any unfair advantages in battle and yet he still caused incredible destruction almost on the scale of Achilles.\n\nThe ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story about the quarrel between Agamemnon and [[Achilles]] in the final year of the war. Following one of the Achaean Army's raids, [[Chryseis]], daughter of [[Chryses]], one of Apollo's priests, was taken as a war prize by Agamemnon. Chryses pleaded with Agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success. Chryses then prayed to Apollo for the safe return of his daughter, which Apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the Achaean Army. After learning from the Prophet Calchas that the plague could be dispelled by returning Chryseis to her father, Agamemnon reluctantly agreed, (but first berated Calchas for previously forcing Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter ([[Iphigenia]]) and released his prize. However, as compensation for his lost prize, Agamemnon demanded a new prize. As a result, Agamemnon stole an attractive slave called [[Briseis]], one of the spoils of war, from Achilles.<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' Translated by Robert Fagles, Penguin Classics, 1998</ref>\n\nAchilles, the greatest warrior of the age, withdrew from battle in response to Agamemnon's action and put the Greek armies at risk of losing the war. Agamemnon, having realized Achilles's importance in winning the war against the Trojan Army, sent ambassadors begging for Achilles to return, offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage, but Achilles refused, only being spurred back into action when his closest friend, Patroclus, was killed in battle.\n\nAlthough not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a representative of \"kingly authority\". As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult [[Chryses]] and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAfter the capture of Troy, [[Cassandra]], the doomed prophetess and daughter of [[Priam]], fell to Agamemnon's lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Return to Greece ==\n[[File:Aegisthus.jpg|thumb|[[Orestes]] slaying [[Clytemnestra]]]]\nAfter a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra either landed in [[Argolis]], or were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country. [[Clytemnestra]], Agamemnon's wife, had taken [[Aegisthus]], son of [[Thyestes]], as a lover. When Agamemnon came home he was slain by either Aegisthus (in the oldest versions of the story)<ref>Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' 3:266</ref> or Clytemnestra. According to the accounts given by [[Pindar]] and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone, a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance.<ref>Aeschylus, ''Agamemnon'', 1389</ref> Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra. Her jealousy of Cassandra, and her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia and at Agamemnon's having gone to war over Helen of Troy, are said to have been the motives for her crime. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAegisthus and Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time, Aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for Agamemnon's father Atreus having fed Thyestes his own children (Thyestes then crying out \"So perish all the race of Pleisthenes!\",<ref>Aeschylus, ''Agamemnon'', 1602</ref> thus explaining Aegisthus' action as justified by his father's curse). Agamemnon's son [[Orestes]] later avenged his father's murder, with the help or encouragement of his sister [[Electra]], by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra (his own mother), thereby inciting the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] (English: the Furies), winged goddesses who tracked down wrongdoers with their hounds' noses and drove them to insanity.\n\n== Other stories ==\n[[Athenaeus]] tells a tale of how Agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend or lover [[Argynnus]], when he drowned in the [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephisus]] river.<ref name=ArgynnusLD>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Charlton T.|author2=Short, Charles|title=Argynnus|work=[[A Latin Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Perseus Project]]|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DArgynnus|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> He buried him, honored with a tomb and a shrine to [[Aphrodite]] Argynnis.<ref>''The Deipnosophists of [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]'', Book XIII Concerning Women, 80D (p. 603)</ref> This episode is also found in [[Clement of Alexandria]],<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' II.38.2</ref> in [[Stephen of Byzantium]] ''(Kopai'' and ''Argunnos),'' and in [[Propertius]], III with minor variations.<ref>Butler, Harold Edgeworth & Barber, Eric Arthur, eds.

Meanwhile, his wife and children (Including Hasan Ali) continued to live in Kahak off the revenues obtained from the family holdings in the Mahallat ({{lang|fa-Latn|Ma\u1e25all\u0101t}}) region. Two years later, in 1817, Shah Khalil Allah was killed in Yazd during a brawl between some of his followers and local shopkeepers. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hasan Ali Shah, also known as Muhammad Hasan, who became the 46th Imam.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\nWhile Khalil Allah resided in Yazd, his land holdings in Kahak were being managed by his son-in-law, Imani Khan Farahani, husband of his daughter Shah Bibi. After Khalil Allah's death, a conflict ensued between Imani Khan Farahani and the local Nizaris (followers of Imam Khalil Allah), as a result of which Khalil Allah's widow and children found themselves left unprovided for.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSO9zh61AGEC&pg=PA464&lpg=PA464&dq=Imani+Khan+Farahani,&source=bl&ots=h5DFHybso1&sig=M6JzaXpFDZWFRx0NDC9ReBLNC18&hl=en&ei=KrnYTOqjEo_GvQOaytyaCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Imani%20Khan%20Farahani%2C&f=false The Ismailis & their history]</ref><ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/> The young Imam and his mother moved to Qumm, but their financial situation worsened. The dowager decided to go to the Qajar court in Tehran to obtain justice for her husband's death and was eventually successful. Those who had been involved in the Shah Khalil Allah's murder were punished. Not only that, but the Persian king [[Fath Ali Shah]] gave his own daughter, princess Sarv-i-Jahan Khanum, in marriage to the young Imam Hasan Ali Shah and provided a princely dowry in land holdings in the Mahallat region. King Fath Ali Shah also appointed Hasan Ali Shah as governor of [[Qumm]] and bestowed upon him the honorific of \"Aga Khan.\" Thus did the title of \"Aga Khan\" enter the family. Hasan Ali Shah become known as Aga Khan Mahallati, and the title of Aga Khan was inherited by his successors. Aga Khan I's mother later moved to India where she died in 1851. Until Fath Ali Shah's death in 1834, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah enjoyed a quiet life and was held in high esteem at the Qajar court.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n==Governorship of Kerman==\n{{Ismailism|collapsed=1}}\nSoon after the accession of [[Muhammad Shah Qajar]] to the throne of his grandfather, Fath Ali Shah, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah was appointed governor of [[Kerman]] in 1835.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/> At the time, Kerman was held by the rebellious sons of Shuja al-Saltana, a pretender to the Qajar throne. The area was also frequently raided by the Afghans. Hasan Ali Shah managed to restore order in Kerman, as well as in [[Bam, Iran|Bam]] and [[Narmashir]], which were also held by rebellious groups. Hasan Ali Shah sent a report of his success to Tehran, but did not receive any material appreciation for his achievements. Despite the service he rendered to the Qajar government, Hasan Ali Shah was dismissed from the governorship of Kerman in 1837, less than two years after his arrival there, and was replaced by Firuz Mirza Nusrat al-Dawla, a younger brother of Muhammad Shah Qajar.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/> Refusing to accept his dismissal, Hasan Ali Shah withdrew with his forces to the [[Arg e Bam|citadel at Bam]]. Along with his two brothers, he made preparations to resist the government forces that were sent against him. He was besieged at Bam for some fourteen months. When it was clear that continuing the resistance was of little use, Hasan Ali Shah sent one of his brothers to Shiraz in order to speak to the governor of Fars to intervene on his behalf and arrange for safe passage out of Kerman. With the governor having interceded, Hasan Ali Shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of Bam only to be double-crossed. He was seized and his possessions were plundered by the government troops. Hasan Ali Shah and his dependents were sent to Kerman and remained as prisoners there for eight months. He was eventually allowed to go to Tehran near the end of 1838-39 where he was able to present his case before the Shah. The Shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah remained in Mahallat for about two years. He managed to gather an army in Mahallat which alarmed Muhammad Shah, who travelled to [[Delijan]] near [[Mahallat]] to determine the truth of the reports about Hasan Ali Shah. Hasan Ali Shah was on a hunting trip at the time, but he sent a messenger to request permission of the monarch to go to Mecca for the hajj pilgrimage. Permission was given, and Hasan Ali Shah's mother and a few relatives were sent to Najaf and other holy cities in Iraq in which the shrines of his ancestors, the Shiite Imams are found.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\nPrior to leaving Mahallat, Hasan Ali Shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of Kerman. Accompanied by his brothers, nephews and other relatives, as well as many followers, he left for Yazd, where he intended to meet some of his local followers. Hasan Ali Shah sent the documents reinstating him to the position of governor of Kerman to Bahman Mirza Baha al-Dawla, the governor of Yazd. Bahman Mirza offered Hasan Ali Shah lodging in the city, but Hasan Ali Shah declined, indicating that he wished to visit his followers living around Yazd. Hajji Mirza Aqasi sent a messenger to Bahman Mirza to inform him of the spuriousness of Hasan Ali Shah's documents and a battle between Bahman M\u012brz\u0101 and Hasan Ali Shah broke out in which Bahman Mirza was defeated. Other minor battles were won by Hasan Ali Shah before he arrived in [[Shahr-e Babak]], which he intended to use as his base for capturing Kerman. At the time of his arrival in Shahr-e Babak, a formal local governor was engaged in a campaign to drive out the Afghans from the city's citadel, and Hasan Ali Shah joined him in forcing the Afghans to surrender.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\nSoon after March 1841, Hasan Ali Shah set out for Kerman. He managed to defeat a government force consisting of 4,000 men near Dashtab, and continued to win a number of victories before stopping at Bam for a time. Soon, a government force of 24,000 men forced Hasan Ali Shah to flee from Bam to Rigan on the border of Baluchistan, where he suffered a decisive defeat. Hasan Ali Shah decided to escape to Afghanistan, accompanied by his brothers and many soldiers and servants.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n==Afghanistan==\nFleeing Iran, he arrived in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan in 1841\u2014a town that had been occupied by an Anglo-Indian army in 1839 in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]]. A close relationship developed between Hasan Ali Shah and the British, which coincided with the final years of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1838\u20131842). After his arrival, Hasan Ali Shah wrote to Sir [[William Macnaghten]], discussing his plans to seize and govern [[Herat]] on behalf of the British. Although the proposal seemed to have been approved, the plans of the British were thwarted by the uprising of [[Dost Mohammad Barakzai|Dost Muhammad]]'s son [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Muhammad Akbar Khan]], who defeated and annihilated the British-Indian garrison at [[Gandamak]] on its retreat from Kabul in January 1842.\n\n==[[Sindh]], [[British India]], now [[Pakistan]]==\nHasan Ali Shah soon proceeded to [[Sindh]], where he rendered further services to the British. The British were able to annex Sindh and for his services, Hasan Ali Shah received an annual pension of \u00a32,000 from General [[Charles James Napier]], the British conqueror of Sindh with whom he had a good relationship.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n==Bombay==\nIn October 1844, Hasan Ali Shah left [[Sind]] for city of [[Bombay]] in [[Bombay Presidency]], [[British India]] passing through [[Cutch State|Cutch]] and [[Kathiawar]] where he spent some time visiting the communities of his followers in the area. After arriving in Bombay in February 1846, the Persian government demanded his extradition from India. The British refused and only agreed to transfer Hasan Ali Shah's residence to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where it would be harder for him to launch new attacks against the Persian government. The British also negotiated the safe return of Hasan Ali Shah to Persia, which was in accordance with his own wish. The government agreed to Hasan Ali Shah's return provided that he would avoid passing through Baluchistan and Kirman and that he was to settle peacefully in Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah was eventually forced to leave for Calcutta in April 1847, where he remained until he received news of the death of Muhammad Shah Qajar. Hasan Ali Shah left for Bombay and the British attempted to obtain permission for his return to Persia. Although some of his lands were restored to the control of his relatives, his safe return could not be arranged, and Hasan Ali Shah was forced to remain a permanent resident of India. While in India, Hasan Ali Shah continued his close relationship with the British, and was even visited by the Prince of Wales (the future King [[Edward VII]]) when he was on a state visit to India. The British came to address Hasan Ali Shah as His Highness. Hasan Ali Shah received protection from the British government in British India as the spiritual head of an important Muslim community.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n==Khoja reassumption and dispute==\n{{main|Aga Khan Case}}\nThe vast majority of his [[Khoja]] Ismaili followers in India welcomed him warmly, but some dissident members, sensing their loss of prestige with the arrival of the Imam, wished to maintain control over communal properties. Because of this, Hasan Ali Shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the Ismaili form of Islam. Although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by Hasan Ali Shah summarizing the practices of the Ismailis, a group of dissenting Khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been Sunni. This group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the Khojas assembled in Bombay. In 1866, these dissenters filed a suit in the Bombay High Court against Hasan Ali Shah, claiming that the Khojas had been Sunni Muslims from the very beginning. The case, commonly referred to as the Aga Khan Case, was heard by [[Joseph Arnould|Sir Joseph Arnould]]. The hearing lasted several weeks, and included testimony from Hasan Ali Shah himself. After reviewing the history of the community, Justice Arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of Hasan Ali Shah and other defendants. The judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the Khojas as a community referred to as Shia Imami Ismailis, and of Hasan Ali Shah as the spiritual head of that community. Hasan Ali Shah's authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again.<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n==Final years==\nHasan Ali Shah spent his final years in Bombay with occasional visits to Pune. Maintaining the traditions of the Iranian nobility to which he belonged, he kept excellent stables and became a well-known figure at the Bombay racecourse. Hasan Ali Shah died after an imamate of sixty-four years in April 1881. He was buried in a specially built shrine at Hasanabad in the [[Mazagaon]] area of Bombay. He was survived by three sons and five daughters. Hasan Ali Shah was succeeded as Imam by his eldest son Aqa Ali Shah, who became [[Aga Khan II]].<ref name=\"Daftary-Ismailis\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Ismaili imams]]\n* [[Fatimids]]\n* [[Isma'ilism]]\n* [[Nizari]]\n* [[Aga Khan]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite EB1911 |first=Mancherjee Merwanjee |last=Bhownagree|authorlink=Mancherjee Bhownagree|wstitle=Aga Khan I.|volume=1 |pages=362\u2013363}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|branch=Clan|name='''Aga Khan I'''<br>of the [[Ahl al-Bayt]]|[[Banu Hashim]]|1804|[[Common Era|C.E]]|1881|[[Common Era|C.E.]]|[[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]]}}\n{{s-rel|sh}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Sh\u0101h Khal\u012blull\u0101h III|Shah Khalil Allah]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title = 46th [[Imamah (Shi'a Ismaili doctrine)|Imam]] of [[Nizari]] [[Ismailism]]|years = 1817\u20131881}}\n{{s-aft|after = [[Aga Khan II|Aqa Ali Shah]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Niz\u0101r\u012b}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khan, Aga, I}}\n[[Category:Persian people]]\n[[Category:1804 births]]\n[[Category:1881 deaths]]\n[[Category:Hashemite people]]\n[[Category:Fatimid caliphs]]\n[[Category:Fatimid dynasty]]\n[[Category:Iranian Ismailis]]\n[[Category:Indian Ismailis]]\n[[Category:Indian imams]]\n[[Category:Nizari imams]]\n[[Category:Scholars from Mumbai]]", "sha1": "3jsd86nely3l5uvxvc8kahi5ssm9dgb"}}, {"title": "Aga Khan III", "ns": "0", "id": "1546", "revision": {"id": "864687237", "parentid": "864687212", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T20:17:16Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jebcubed", "id": "33351428"}, "comment": "Undid revision 864687212 by [[Special:Contributions/184.71.210.210|184.71.210.210]] ([[User talk:184.71.210.210|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|48th Imam of the Nizari Ismaili community}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox religious biography\n| honorific prefix = Prince\n| name = Aga Khan III\n| title = Aga Khan III\n| native_name_lang = \n| image = HH the AGA KHAN 1936.jpg\n| successor = [[Aga Khan IV]]\n| caption = The Aga Khan III in 1936\n| predecessor = [[Aga Khan II]]\n| religion = [[Shia Islam]]\n| denomination = [[Isma'ilism]]\n| school = [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]]\n| lineage = [[Fatimid]]\n| other_name = Sultan Muhammed Shah\n| dharma_names = <!-- or: | dharma_name = -->\n| monastic_name = \n| pen_name = \n| posthumous_name = \n| nationality = \n| home_town = \n| ethnicity = \n| birth_name = \n| birth_date = {{birth date|1877|11|02|df=y}}<ref name=Britannica>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aga-Khan-III, Biography of Aga Khan III on Encyclopedia Britannica, Updated 18 September 2003, Retrieved 31 March 2017</ref>\n| birth_place = [[Karachi]], [[Bombay Presidency]], [[British India]] (now [[Pakistan]])\n| death_date = {{death date and age|1957|07|11| 1877|11|02|df=y}}<ref name=Britannica/>\n| death_place = Versoix, near [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]\n| resting_place = [[Mausoleum of Aga Khan]], [[Aswan]], Egypt\n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{coord|latitude|longitude|type:landmark|display=inline,title}} -->\n| alma_mater = \n| spouse = {{Plainlist|\n* Shahzadi Begum\n* Cleope Teresa Magliano\n* Andr\u00e9e Jos\u00e9phine Carron\n* [[Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan]] (birth name, Yvonne Blanche Labrousse)\n}}\n| children = {{Plainlist|\n* Giuseppe Mahdi Khan\n* [[Prince Aly Khan|Aly Salman Aga Khan]]\n* [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]]\n}}\n| parents = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Aga Khan II|Aqa Ali Shah]] (father)\n* Shams al-Muluk (mother)\n}}\n| profession = \n| education  = \n| initiation = 1885\n| post       = 48th [[Nizari]] Im\u0101m\n}}\n\n'''Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCSI|GCMG|GCIE|GCVO|PC}} (2 November 1877{{snd}}11 July 1957) was the 48th [[Shia Imam|Imam]] of the [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] religion.

Aga Khan called on the [[British Raj]] to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India, the so-called 'Two Nation Theory'. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas.

He was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India by George V (1912). He was appointed a GCMG in 1923. He received like recognition for his public services from the German Emperor, the Sultan of Turkey, the Shah of Persia and other potentates.{{sfn|Bhownagree|1911}}\n\nIn 1906, the Aga Khan was a founding member and first president of the [[All India Muslim League]], a political party which pushed for the creation of an independent Muslim nation in the north west regions of India, then under British colonial rule, and later established the country of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nDuring the three [[Round Table Conferences (India)]] in London from 1930\u201332, he played an important role to bring about Indian constitutional reforms.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nIn 1934, he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and served as a member of the [[League of Nations]] (1934\u201337), becoming the President of the League of Nations in 1937.<ref name=findpk/>\n\n==Imamate==\n{{Ismailism|collapsed=1}}\nUnder the  leadership of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, the first half of the 20th century was a period of significant development for the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b community. Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the Indian Subcontinent and in East Africa.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=199\u2013206}}</ref> Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Im\u0101ms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] Im\u0101m and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nThe Jubilees of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885\u20131957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ism\u0101'\u012bliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn [[British Raj|India]] and later in [[Pakistan]], social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan III, \"for the relief of humanity\". They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. ''Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls'' were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In East Africa, major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully equipped [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|hospital]] in [[Nairobi]]. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.\n\nSir Sultan Muhammad Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/> These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.<ref name=\"DaftaryShort1998p199\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs resided. In 1947, British rule in the Indian Subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and later [[Bangladesh]], resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the Middle East, the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in Iran, demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to [[decolonisation]], swept by what [[Harold Macmillan]], the then British prime minister, termed the \"wind of change\". By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the [[Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b]] population on the continent resided, including [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Madagascar]], Rwanda, Burundi and [[Zaire]], had attained their political independence.\n\n==Racehorse ownership and equestrianism==\nHe was an owner of thoroughbred racing horses, including a record equalling five winners of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] ([[Blenheim (horse)|Blenheim]], [[Bahram (horse)|Bahram]], [[Mahmoud (horse)|Mahmoud]], [[My Love (horse)|My Love]], [[Tulyar (horse)|Tulyar]]) and a total of sixteen winners of [[British Classic Races]]. He was [[British flat racing Champion Owner]] thirteen times.  According to [[Ben Pimlott]], biographer of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], the Aga Khan presented Her Majesty with a [[filly]] called ''Astrakhan'', who won at [[Hurst Park Racecourse]] in 1950.\n\nIn 1926, the Aga Khan gave a cup (the [[Aga Khan Trophy]]) to be awarded to the winners of an international team [[show jumping]] competition held at the annual horse show of the [[Royal Dublin Society]] in Dublin, Ireland every first week in August.<ref>[http://www.dublinhorseshow.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=34 The Aga Khan Trophy], Dublin Horse Show, accessed 9 July 2007</ref> It attracts competitors from all of the main show jumping nations and is carried live on Irish national television.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n* He married, on 2 November 1896, in [[Pune]], India, Shahzadi Begum, his first cousin and a granddaughter of [[Aga Khan I]].\n* He married 1908,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ismaili.net/histoire/history08/history833.html |title=Marriages of the Aga Khan III |publisher=Ismaili.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-26}}</ref> Cleope Teresa Magliano (1888\u20131926).

J. Hulbert]], a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, [[Quincy Adams Shaw]], had discovered a rich copper lode known as the [[Calumet conglomerate]] on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] in [[Michigan]]. Hulbert persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] based in [[Calumet, Michigan]]. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise.\n\nOver the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter, due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines. He returned to the mines in March 1867, with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations.\n\nAgassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation. The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] with Shaw as its first president. In August 1871, Shaw \"retired\" to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death. Until the turn of the century, this company was by far the largest copper producer in the United States, many years producing over half of the total.\n\nAgassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time, year-round, attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard. Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative [[zoology]] and other purposes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nShortly after the death of his father in 1873, Agassiz acquired a small peninsula in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], which features spectacular views of Narragansett Bay. Here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence. The house was completed in 1875 and today is known as the [[Inn at Castle Hill]].\n\nIn 1875, he surveyed [[Lake Titicaca]], Peru, examined the copper mines of Peru and [[Chile]], and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] (MCZ), of which he was first curator from 1874 to 1885 and then director until his death in 1910.<ref>About MCZ (History) - http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/about/history.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518055636/http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/about/history.html |date=2018-05-18 }}</ref> He assisted [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' Expedition]], and wrote the ''Review of the Echini'' (2 vols., 1872\u20131874) in the reports. Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three [[Marine biology dredge|dredging]] expeditions of the steamer ''Blake'' of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1896 Agassiz visited [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] and inspected the [[Great Barrier Reef]], publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.\n\nOf Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology. However, in 1865, he published with [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], his stepmother, ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'', a work at once exact and stimulating. They also published, in 1871, ''Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe received the German Order [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] for Science and Arts in August 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=19 August 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36850| }}</ref>\n\nAgassiz served as a president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], which since 1913 has awarded the [[Alexander Agassiz Medal]] in his memory.

He is best known for his appearance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]],'' which describes the [[Symposium|banquet]] given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first [[tragedy]] at the [[Lenaia]] in 416.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agathon|volume=1|page=371}}</ref>  He is also a prominent character in [[Aristophanes]]' comedy the ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nAgathon was the son of Tisamenus,<ref name=OCD>{{cite book|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|page=25|edition=2}}</ref> and the lifelong companion of [[Pausanias (Athenian)|Pausanias]], with whom he appears in both the ''Symposium'' and Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''.<ref>[[Pierre L\u00e9v\u00eaque]], ''Agathon'' (Paris: Societe d'Edition Les Belles Lettres, 1955), pp. 163-4.</ref>  Together with Pausanias, he later moved to the court of [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus]], king of [[Macedon]], who was recruiting playwrights; it is here that he probably died around 401 BC. Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: [[Aristotle]] tells us in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1456a) that the characters and plot of his ''[[Anthos (play)|Anthos]]'' were original and not, following Athenian dramatic orthodoxy, borrowed from mythological or historical subjects.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' 9.</ref>  Agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays.\n\nAgathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement. The [[epideictic]] speech in praise of love which Agathon recites in the ''Symposium'' is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions, and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of [[Gorgias]].  In the ''Symposium,'' Agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet Aristophanes, but this alleged friendship did not prevent Aristophanes from harshly criticizing Agathon in at least two of his comic plays: the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' and the (now lost) ''Gerytades''.  In the later play ''Frogs'', Aristophanes softens his criticisms, but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on Agathon's name (\u1f01\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 \"good\") that he makes Dionysus call him a \"good poet\".\n\nAgathon was also a friend of [[Euripides]], another recruit to the court of Archelaus of Macedon.\n\n==Physical appearance==\nAgathon's extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources; the historian W. Rhys Roberts observes that \"\u1f41 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u1f08\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd (''ho kalos Agathon'') has become almost a stereotyped phrase.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=W. Rhys |last=Roberts |title=Aristophanes and Agathon |journal=[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=20 |year=1900 |issue= |pages=50 |jstor=623742 }}</ref>  The most detailed surviving description of Agathon is in the ''Thesmophoriazousae,'' in which Agathon appears as a pale, clean-shaven young man dressed in women's clothes.  Scholars are unsure how much of Aristophanes' portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention.\n\nAfter a close reading of the ''Thesmophoriazousae,'' the historian Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet [[Anacreon]], as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings.  Snyder theorizes that Agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (''kekryphalos'', an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men.  According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: \"he seems to think of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jane McIntosh |last=Snyder |title=Aristophanes' Agathon as Anacreon |journal=''Hermes'' |volume=102 |year=1974 |issue=2 |pages=246 |jstor=4475842 }}</ref>\n\n==Plato's epigram==\nAgathon has been thought to be the subject of ''Lovers' Lips'', an [[Epigrams (Plato)|epigram]] attributed to Plato:\n\n::::Kissing Agathon, I had my soul upon my lips; for it rose, poor wretch, as though to cross over.\n\nAnother translation reads:\n\n::::Kissing Agathon, I found my soul at my lips. Poor thing! It went there, hoping--to slip across.\n\nAlthough the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries, it was probably not composed for Agathon the tragedian, nor was it composed by Plato.  Stylistic evidence suggests that the poem (with most of Plato's other alleged epigrams) was actually written some time after Plato had died: its form is that of the Hellenistic erotic epigram, which did not become popular until after 300 BC.  According to 20th-century scholar Walther Ludwig, the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of Plato sometime between 250 BC and 100 BC and adopted by later writers from this source.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Walther |last=Ludwig |title=Plato's Love Epigrams |journal=''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'' |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=1963 |pages=59\u201382 |doi= }}</ref>\n\n==Known plays==\nOf Agathon's plays, only six titles and thirty-one fragments have survived:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Aerope''\n*''Alcmeon''\n*''[[Anthos (play)|Anthos]]'' or ''Antheus'' (\"The Flower\")\n*''Mysoi'' (\"Mysians\")\n*''Telephos'' (\"[[Telephus]]\")\n*''Thyestes''\n{{div col end}}\n\nFragments in [[Johann August Nauck|A Nauck]], ''Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta'' (1887).\n\n==Quotations==\n* \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9,<br>\u1f00\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f05\u03c3\u03c3\u1fbd \u1f02\u03bd \u1f96 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1.\n** Even God cannot change the past.\n** As quoted in [[Aristotle]], ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Book VI, sect. 2, 1139b\n** Every mammal in the world haveth at least once fed from the milk\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of speakers in Plato's dialogues]]\n*[[Symposium (painting)]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*''The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization'', volume 1, by Alfred Bates.

Born with one leg shorter, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king [[Agis II]], especially because the latter had a son ([[Leotychidas, son of Agis|Leotychidas]]). Therefore, Agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the ''[[agoge]].'' However, Leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of [[Alcibiades]]) and Agesilaus became king in 398, at the age of about forty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|last=Smith|first=William|publisher=James Walton|year=1870|volume=v. 1|location=London|pages=69}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J.

Their unique relationship would serve an important role during Agesilaus' later campaigns in Asia Minor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Xenophon]], ''Hell.'' iii. 3, to the end, ''Agesilaus''</ref>\n\n===Early reign===\n[[File:Dionysius of Syracuse military expedition for Alcetas Map (English).png|thumb|right|Agesilaus [[Bardylis#Raid on Epirus|expels the Illyrians from Epirus]] in 385 BC]]\nAgesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the [[conspiracy of Cinadon]], shortly after 398 BC.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>  Then, in 396, Agesilaus crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 [[neodamodes]] (freed [[helots]]) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] dominion.  On the eve of sailing from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as [[Agamemnon]] had done before the [[Troy|Trojan]] expedition, but the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.  On his arrival at [[Ephesus]] a three months' truce was concluded with [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided [[Phrygia]], where he easily won immense booty from the satrap [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]]; Tissaphernes could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria. In these campaigns Agesilaus also benefited from the aid of the [[Ten Thousand]] (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea. After spending the winter organizing a [[cavalry]] force (''[[hippeis]]''), he made a successful incursion into [[Lydia]] in the spring of 395.  [[Tithraustes]] was sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure.  An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern [[satrap]]y and again invaded [[Phrygia]], which he ravaged until the following spring.  He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>\n\nDuring these campaigns, [[Lysander]] attempted to manipulate Agesilaus into ceding his authority. Agesilaus, the former passive lover of Lysander, would have nothing of this, and reminded Lysander (who was only a Spartan general) who was king. He had Lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. This dominating move by Agesilaus earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of Lysander himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 394, while encamped on the [[plain of Thebe]], he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] himself, when he was recalled to [[Greece]] to fight in the [[Corinthian War]] between [[Sparta]] and the combined forces of [[Athens]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]] and several minor states. (The outbreak of the conflict had been encouraged by Persian payments to Sparta's Greek rivals.) A rapid march through [[Thrace]] and [[Macedon]]ia brought him to [[Thessaly]], where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.  Reinforced by [[Phocis|Phocian]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenian]] troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at [[Coronea]] in [[Boeotia]] and in a [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)|hotly contested battle]] was technically victorious. However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and Agesilaus himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of [[Delphi]] to the [[Peloponnese]]. Shortly before this battle the Spartan [[navy]], of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off [[Knidos|Cnidus]] by a powerful Persian fleet under [[Conon]] and [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]].<ref name=\"livius\"/>\n\nDuring these conflicts in mainland Greece, [[Lysander]] perished while attacking the walls of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. [[Pausanias II of Sparta|Pausanias]], the second king of Sparta (see [[Spartan Constitution]] for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide Lysander with reinforcements as they marched into [[Boeotia]], yet failed to arrive in time to assist Lysander, likely because Pausanias disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government. Pausanias failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 393, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of [[Argolis]].  In 392 BC he made several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory, capturing [[Lechaeum]] and [[Piraeus]].  The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by [[Iphicrates]], neutralized these successes, and Agesilaus returned to Sparta.  In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in [[Acarnania]],{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} but two years later the [[Peace of Antalcidas]], warmly supported by Agesilaus, put an end to the war, maintaining Spartan hegemony over Greece.  In this interval, Agesilaus declined command over Sparta's aggression on [[Mantineia]], and justified [[Phoebidas]]' seizure of the Theban [[Cadmea]] so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Decline===\nWhen war broke out afresh with Thebes, Agesilaus twice invaded [[Boeotia]] (in 378 and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.  In the congress of 371 an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general [[Epaminondas]], and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for [[Cleombrotus I|Cleombrotus]] to march against Thebes in 371.  Cleombrotus was defeated at [[Leuctra]] and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.<ref name=\"livius\"/>\n\nIn 370 Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to [[Mantineia]], and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of [[Arcadia]].  He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of [[helot]]s, [[perioeci]] and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by [[Epaminondas]] penetrating [[Laconia]] that same year. Again, in 362, Epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march.  The [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.  According to [[Xenophon]],<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''Agesilaus'', ii. 26, 27</ref> Agesilaus, in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the [[satrap]] [[Ariobarzanes II of Cius|Ariobarzanes II]] in his revolt against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in 364 ([[Revolt of the Satraps]]), and in 361 he went to [[Egypt]] at the head of a [[mercenary]] force to aid the king [[Nectanebo I]] and his regent [[Teos of Egypt|Teos]] against Persia.  He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival [[Nectanebo II]], who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 [[attic talent|talents]].  On his way home Agesilaus died in [[Cyrenaica]], around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.  His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his son [[Archidamus III]].\n\n==Legacy==\nAgesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an [[oracle]] having warned Sparta against a \"lame reign.\"  Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in [[guerrilla warfare]], alert and quick, yet cautious\u2014a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.  Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.  As examples: there is the story of his riding a stick-horse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son [[Archidamus III|Archidamus]]' for [[Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias|Cleonymus]], he saved [[Sphodrias]], Cleonymus' father, from execution for his incursion into the [[Piraeus]], and dishonorable retreat, in 378.<ref name=\"DGRBM\"/>  Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and [[siegecraft]].<ref name=\"OCD\"/>\n\nAs a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.  Agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.  Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.<ref name=\"OCD\"/> Historian J. B. Bury remarks that \"there is something melancholy about his career:\" born into a Sparta that was the unquestioned continental power of Hellas, the Sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forbears, had seen its population severely decline, and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J. B.|last2=Meiggs|first2=Russell|publisher=Macmillan|year=1956|isbn=|location=London|pages=627-628}}</ref>\n\nOther historical accounts paint Agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader. His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander. These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by Lysander in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as Pausanias and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power. The ancient historian [[Xenophon]] was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into [[Asia Minor]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Plutarch]] includes among Agesilaus' 78 essays and speeches comprising the [[Apophthegmata Laconica|apophthegmata]] Agesilaus' letter to the [[ephor]]s on his recall:\n{{quote|We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia. But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it. For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.  And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.}}\n\nAnd when asked whether Agesilaus wanted a memorial erected in his honor:\n{{quote|If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.<ref>In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f30 \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1, \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03cc \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9; \u03b5\u1f30 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bc\u03ae, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4' \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}}</ref>}}\n<!--\nAs he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, \"For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial.

She was born in c. 14 BC the daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], a close supporter of Rome's first [[emperor]] [[Augustus]], and Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]]. At the time of her birth, her brothers [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]] and [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] were the adoptive sons of Augustus and were his heirs until their deaths in AD 2 and 4, respectively. Following their deaths, her cousin [[Germanicus]] was made the adoptive son of [[Tiberius]] as part of Augustus' succession scheme in the adoptions of AD 4 in which Tiberius was adopted by Augustus. As a corollary to the adoption, Agrippina was wed to Germanicus in order to bring him closer to the [[Julia (gens)|Julian]] family.\n\nShe is known to have traveled with him throughout his career, taking her children everywhere they went. In AD 14, Germanicus was deployed in Gaul as governor and general. While there, the late Augustus sent her son [[Caligula|Gaius]] to her unspecified location. She liked to dress him in a little soldiers' outfit complete with boots for which Gaius earned the nickname \"Caligula\" (\"little boots\"). After three years in Gaul they returned to Rome and her husband was awarded a triumph on 26 May AD 17 to commemorate his victories. The following year, Germanicus was sent to govern over the eastern provinces. While Germanicus was active in his administration, the governor of Syria [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] began feuding with him. During the feud, her husband died of illness on 10 October AD 19.\n\nGermanicus was cremated in [[Antioch]] and she transported his ashes to Rome where they were interred at the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. Agrippina was vocal in claiming her husband was murdered to promote Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] (\"Drusus the Younger\") as heir. Following the model of her grandmother Livia, she spent the time following Germanicus' death supporting the cause of her sons [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar]]. This put her and her sons at odds with the powerful [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] who would begin eliminating their supporters with accusations of treason and sexual misconduct in AD 26. Her family's rivalry with Sejanus would culminate with her and Nero's exile in AD 29. Nero was exiled to [[Pontia]] and she was exiled to the island of [[Pandateria]], where she would remain until her death by starvation in AD 33.\n\n==Name==\n{{see also|Roman naming conventions}}\nFollowing the Roman custom of parents and children sharing the same nomen and [[cognomen]], women in the same family would often share the same name. Accordingly, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] had many relatives who shared the name \"Vipsania Agrippina\". To distinguish Marcus Agrippa's daughter from his granddaughter, historians refer to his daughter as [[Latin language|Latin]] \"'''Agrippina Maior'''\", literally \"'''Agrippina the Elder'''\". Likewise, Agrippina's daughter is referred to as \"Agrippina Minor\", literally \"Agrippina the Younger\".<ref>{{harvnb|Powell|2015|p=xiv}}</ref> Like her father, Agrippina the Elder avoided her cognomen and was never called \"Vipsania\".<ref name=Lott301>{{harvnb|Lott|2012|p=301}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Agrippa wearing Naval Crown.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[denarius]]'' depicting Agrippa wearing a combination of the ''[[Mural crown|corona muralis]]'' and the ''[[Naval crown|corona rostalis]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1903|p=242}}</ref>]]\nMarcus Vipsanius Agrippa was an early supporter of [[Augustus]] (then \"Octavius\") during the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] that ensued as a result of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. His father, [[Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa]], was a key general in Augustus' armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Sextus Pompeius]]. From early in the emperor's reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who appeared to be on his deathbed in 23{{nbsp}}BC, a sign that he would become ''[[princeps]]'' were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor's nephew, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], came of age. However, Marcellus died that year of an illness that became an epidemic in Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2014|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Southern|2013|p=203}}</ref><ref name=Dunston274>{{harvnb|Dunstan|2010|p=274}}</ref>\n\nNow, with Marcellus dead, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter [[Julia the Elder]], who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given ''[[tribunician power|tribunicia potestas]]'' (\"the tribunician power\") in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar.

Around the time of their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth ever ''[[Ludi Saeculares]]'' (\"Secular Games\"). [[Cassius Dio]] says the adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace \u2013 the ''[[Pax Augusta]]''.

She had five siblings: a half-sister [[Vipsania Agrippina]], three brothers; Gaius, Lucius, and [[Postumus Agrippa]] (all were adopted by Augustus; Gaius and Lucius were adopted together following Lucius' birth in 17 BC; Postumus in AD 4),<ref>{{harvnb|Pettinger|2012|p=47}}</ref> and a sister who shared the same mother, [[Julia the Younger]].<ref name=Powellxxxiv>{{harvnb|Powell|2015|p=xxxiv}}</ref>\n\nShe was a prominent member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. On her mother's side, she was the younger granddaughter of Augustus. She was the sister-in-law of [[Tiberius]] by her half-sister's marriage to him, and of [[Claudius]], the brother of her husband [[Germanicus]]. Her son [[Caligula|Gaius]], better known as \"Caligula\", would be the fourth emperor, and her grandson [[Nero]] would be the last emperor of the dynasty.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=321}}</ref>\n\nIn 13 BC, her father returned to Rome and was promptly sent to [[Pannonia]] to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12 BC), but the Pannonians gave up that same year. Agrippa returned to [[Campania]] in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after. After her father's death, she spent the rest of her childhood in Augustus' household where access to her was strictly controlled.<ref name=Powell194>{{harvnb|Powell|2015|p=194}}</ref><ref name=Wood65>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome of the currency issued in 13\u201312 BC, the ''[[aurei]]'' and ''[[denarius|denarii]]'', make it clear that her brothers Gaius and Lucius were Augustus' intended heirs. Their father was no longer available to assume the reigns of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen. Lucius' and Gaius' military and political careers would steadily advance until their deaths in AD 2 and 4, respectively.<ref name=Wood65/><ref name=Pettinger235>{{harvnb|Pettinger|2012|p=235}}</ref>\n\nThe death of her brothers meant that Augustus had to find other heirs. Although he initially considered Agrippina's second cousin Germanicus a potential heir for a time, Livia convinced Augustus to adopt Tiberius, Livia's son from her first marriage with [[Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. Although Augustus adopted Tiberius, it was on condition that Tiberius first adopt Germanicus so that Germanicus would become second in the line of succession. It was a corollary to the adoption, probably in the next year, that Agrippina was married to Germanicus.<ref name=Pettinger235/><ref name=Salisbury3>{{harvnb|Salisbury|2001|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swan|2004|p=142}}</ref>\n\nBy her husband Germanicus, she had nine children: [[Nero Julius Caesar]], [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus Julius Caesar]], Tiberius Julius Caesar, a child of unknown name (normally referenced as ''Ignotus''), Gaius the Elder, the Emperor Caligula (Gaius the Younger), the empress Agrippina the Younger, [[Julia Drusilla]], and [[Julia Livilla]]. Only six of his children came of age; Tiberius and the Ignotus died as infants, and Gaius the Elder in his early childhood.<ref name=Powellxxxiv/><ref name=Salisbury3/>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Statue Germanicus Louvre Ma1238.jpg|thumb|140px|A statue of Germanicus (ca.

Throughout Germanicus' military career, Agrippina is known to have traveled with her husband and their children.<ref name=Lott301/> Germanicus' career advanced steadily as he advanced in ranks following the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' until, in AD 12, he was made consul. The following year, he was given command over Gaul and the forces on the Rhine, totaling eight legions.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|2003|pp=202-4}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 May AD 14, her one-year-old son Gaius was sent by Augustus from Rome to join her in Gaul. She was pregnant at the time and, while Germanicus was collecting taxes across Gaul, she remained at an unspecified separate location, presumably for her safety. Augustus sent her a letter with her son's party, which read:<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|p=41}}</ref>\n{{quote|Yesterday I arranged with Talarius and Asillinus to bring your boy Gaius on the fifteen day before the [[Kalends]] of June, if it be the will of the gods.

Farewell, my Agrippina, and take care to come in good health to your Germanicus.<ref name=Mellor369>{{harvnb|Mellor|1998|p=369}}</ref>}}\n\nLater that year, on 19 August, Augustus died while away in Campania. As a result, Tiberius was made ''princeps''. While Germanicus was administering the oath of fealty to Tiberius, a mutiny began among the forces on the Rhine. During the mutiny, Agrippina brought out their sixth child, Gaius, and made preparations to take him away to a safer town nearby. He was in a full army outfit including the legionary hobnailed boots (''caligae''). These military-booties earned Gaius the nickname \"Caligula\" (lit. \"little boots\"), and garnered sympathy for Agrippina and the child among the soldiery. Tacitus attributes her actions as having quelled the mutiny (Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 1.40\u20134).<ref name=Mellor369/><ref>{{harvnb|MacLachlan|2013|p=135}}</ref>\n\nOnce the mutiny was put to an end, Germanicus allowed the soldiers to deal with the ringleaders, which they did with brutal severity. He then led them against the Germanic tribes, perhaps in an effort to prevent future mutiny. Germanicus would remain in Gaul fighting against the Germanic tribes until AD 16, at which time he was recalled to Rome by Tiberius. His campaigns won him much renown among the Roman people, and he was awarded a triumph on 26 May AD 17.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|pp=45-6}}</ref>\n\n===Widowhood===\n[[File:Benjamin West 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Benjamin West]], ''Agrippina landing at Brundisium with the ashes of Germanicus'' (1766), oil on canvas.

During their time there, Germanicus was active in his administration of the eastern regions.<ref name=Wood203/> Piso did not get along well with Germanicus and their relationship only got worse. In AD 19, Germanicus ordered Piso to leave the province, which Piso began to do. On his way back to Rome, Piso stopped at the island of Kos off the coast of Syria. Around that time Germanicus fell ill and he died on 10 October AD 19 at [[Antioch]].<ref name=Alston26>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=26}}</ref> Rumours spread of Piso poisoning her husband on the emperor's orders.<ref name=Powell194/>\n\nAfter Germanicus' cremation in the forum of Antioch, Agrippina personally carried the ashes of her husband to Rome. The transportation of the ashes witnessed national mourning. She landed at the port of [[Brundisium]] in southern Italy where she was met with huge crowds of sympathizers. From Brundisium, a [[praetorian guard|praetorian]] escort was provided for her by the emperor in respect to her rank as the wife of a governor-general. As she passed each town, the people and local magistrates came out to show their respect. [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus the Younger]] (son of Tiberius), Claudius, and the consuls journeyed to join the procession as well. Once she made it to Rome, her husband's ashes were interred at the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. Tiberius and Livia did not make an appearance.<ref name=Alston26/><ref name=Powell194/>\n\n==Life after Germanicus==\n[[File:Arte romana, gran cammeo della ste chapelle con esaltazione della dinastia giulio-claudia, 23 dc ca., livia maggiore, druso cesare e agrippina.JPG|thumb|right|[[Great Cameo of France]] detail depicting [[Livia]] (left), Drusus (center), and Agrippina the Elder (right).<ref>{{harvnb|Fischer|2016|p=45}}</ref>]]\nHer marriage to Germanicus had served to unite the imperial family. Agrippina may have suspected Tiberius' involvement in the death of her husband and, with Germanicus dead, she no longer had any familial ties to the emperor. Historian [[Richard Alston (classicist)|Richard Alston]] says it is likely that either Tiberius or Livia were behind the exile of Agrippina's half-sister and the death of Postumus. He notes the death of Agrippina's mother, who starved herself to death amidst her exile in AD 14, linking her death to Tiberius' disdain for her.<ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=30}}</ref>\n\nAgrippina was vocal about her feelings claiming that Germanicus was murdered to promote Drusus the Younger as Tiberius' heir, and worried that the birth of the Younger Drusus' twin sons would displace her own sons in the line of succession. Her fears proved to be unfounded, with her son Nero receiving the ''[[toga virilis]]'' (\"toga of manhood\") from Tiberius and the Younger Drusus on 7 June AD 20. Further, Nero was promised the office of [[quaestor]] five years before the ordinary age and was wed to Tiberius' granddaughter [[Julia Livia|Julia]]. Agrippina's second oldest son Drusus was given similar honors and was also promised the office of quaestor in advance when he reached his fourteenth year in AD 23.<ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=124}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rowe|2002|p=87}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, Tiberius' [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]] was becoming powerful in Rome and began feuding with Drusus the Younger. While the exact causes of the feud are unknown, it ended when the Younger Drusus died of seemingly natural causes on 14 September AD 23. After the death of Tiberius' son, Agrippina wanted to advance the careers of her sons, who were all potential heirs for Tiberius. To achieve this, Agrippina presented the [[Great Cameo of France]] to Tiberius. It was a personalized gift that positioned the family of Germanicus around the emperor. The work was designed to convince Tiberius to chose her children as his heirs. It is likely she was the one who commissioned the Great Cameo of France.<ref name=Fischer46>{{harvnb|Fischer|2016|p=46}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Levick|1999|p=127}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the death of Tiberius' son elevated her own children to the position of heirs. Her sons were the logical choice, because they were the sons of Germanicus and Tiberius' grandsons were too young. Nero was becoming popular in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] due in part, Tacitus says, to his resemblance with his father. The rise of her children was threatening to Sejanus' position. Resultantly, Sejanus began spreading rumors about Agrippina in the imperial court. The coming years were marked with increasing hostility between Sejanus and Agrippina and her sons. This effectively caused factions to rise in the aristocracy between her family and Sejanus.<ref name=Fischer46/><ref name=Alston31>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=31}}</ref>\n\n===Political rivalry===\n[[File:Bronze sestertius with the head of Agrippina the Elder, daughter of Agrippa and Julia, the daughter of Augustus.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze [[sestertius]] with Agrippina on the obverse.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrero|1911|p=219}}</ref>]]\nOn [[New Year's Day]], AD 24, Sejanus had the [[pontiff|priests]] and magistrates add prayers for the health of Nero and Drusus in addition to those normally offered to the emperor on that day. Tiberius was not happy with this and he voiced his displeasure in the Senate. In addition, he questioned the priests of the [[Palatine]]. Some of the priests who offered the prayers were relatives of Agrippina and Germanicus. This made Tiberius suspicious of her and marked a change in his attitude toward her and her older sons, but not Caligula.<ref>{{harvnb|Dando-Collins|2008|pp=94-5}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Adams|2007|p=107}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 25, Sejanus requested Livilla's hand in marriage. Livilla was a niece of the emperor, which would have made him a member of the imperial family. While this did make his ambitions clear, his request was denied. The loss may have been huge for Sejanus had the dissensions in the imperial household not been deteriorating. Relations were so bad that Agrippina refused to eat at Tiberius' dinner parties for fear of being poisoned. She also asked Tiberius if she could be allowed to remarry, which he also refused.<ref name=Alston31/> \n\nIf either of them were allowed to remarry it would have threatened the line of succession that Tiberius was comfortable with. By refusing Sejanus' request, Tiberius made it clear he was content with the children of Germanicus and his own grandchildren being his successors. Had Sejanus married Livilla, their children would have provided another line of possible successors. The implication of Agrippina's request was that she needed a man from outside the imperial family to serve as protector and step-father of possible imperial heirs, a powerful position. It was also an implied reprimand: Tiberius was meant to be the guardian of the imperial family.<ref name=Alston31/>\n\nTiberius was in a tough position. He was faced with a conflict between his family and his friend. His solution was surprising. In AD 26, left Rome altogether and retired to the island of [[Capri]] in the [[Bay of Naples]]. He cut himself off from the factions altogether and abandoned politics. He left Rome in the care of Sejanus. This allowed Sejanus to freely attack his rivals.<ref name=Adams108>{{harvnb|Adams|2007|p=108}}</ref><ref name=Alston32>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Downfall===\nWith Tiberius away from Rome, the city would see a rise of politically motivated trials on the part of Sejanus and his supporters against Agrippina and her associates. Many of her friends and associates were subsequently accused of ''[[maiestas]]'' (\"treason\") by the growing number of accusers. It was also common to see charges of sexual misconduct and corruption. In AD 27, Agrippina found herself placed under house arrest in her suburban villa outside [[Herculaneum]].<ref name=Adams108/><ref name=Phang688>{{harvnb|Phang|Spence|Kelley|Londey|2016|p=688}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=35}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 28, the Senate voted that altars to ''[[Clementia]]'' (mercy) and ''[[Amicitia]]'' (friendship) be raised. At that time, ''Clementia'' was considered a virtue of the ruling class, for only the powerful could give clemency. The altar of ''Amicitia'' was flanked by statues of Sejanus and Tiberius. By this time, his association with Tiberius was such that there were those in Roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor. Sejanus' birthday was honored as if he were a member of the imperial family. According to Richard Alston, \"Sejanus' association with Tiberius must have at least indicated to the people that he would be further elevated.\"<ref name=Alston32/>\n\nSejanus did not begin his final attack on Agrippina until after the death of Livia in AD 29. Tacitus reports a letter being sent to the Senate from Tiberius denouncing Agrippina for her arrogance and prideful attitude, and Nero for engaging in shameful sexual activities. The Senate would not begin highly unpopular prosecutions against her or her son until it received clear instructions from Tiberius to do so. Despite public outcry, Agrippina and Nero were declared public enemies (''hostes'') following a repeat of the accusations by the emperor. They were both exiled; Nero to [[Pontia]] where he was killed or encouraged to commit suicide in AD 31, and Agrippina to the island of [[Pandateria]] (the same place her mother was exiled to).<ref name=Alston32/><ref name=Phang688/> \n\n[[Suetonius]] says that while on the island of Pandateria, she lost an eye when she was beaten by a centurion. She would remain on the island until her death in AD 33. Accounts of her death vary. She is said to have died from starvation, but it is not certain whether or not it was self-imposed. Tacitus says food was withheld from her in an effort to make her death seem like a suicide.<ref name=Phang688/>\n\n==Post mortem==\n[[File:Eustache Le Sueur - Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors - WGA12607.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Eustache Le Sueur]], ''Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors'' (1647), oil on canvas. [[Royal Collection]], [[Windsor Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zirpolo|2010|p=322}}</ref>]]\nHer son Drusus was later also exiled on charges of sexual misdemeanors. Sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in October AD 31, just after the death of Nero, the exact cause for which remains unclear. Alston suggests that Sejanus may have been acting in Tiberius' favor to remove Germanicus' family from power, noting that Agrippina and Nero's brother Drusus were left in exile even after Sejanus' death.<ref>{{harvnb|Bingham|1999|p=66}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bunson|2014|p=388}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alston|1998|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThe deaths of Agrippina's older sons elevated her youngest son Caligula to the position of successor and he became ''princeps'' when Tiberius died in AD 37. Drusus the Younger's son [[Tiberius Gemellus]] was summoned to Capri by his father Tiberius, where he and Caligula were made joint-heirs. When Caligula assumed power he made Gemellus his adopted son, but Caligula soon had Gemellus killed for plotting against him.<ref>{{harvnb|Adams|2007|p=109}}</ref>\n\nAfter he became emperor, Caligula took on the role of a dutiful son and brother in a public show of ''[[pietas]]'' (\"piety\"). He went out to the islands of Pontia and Pandateria in order to recover the remains of Agrippina and Nero. It was not easy to recover Nero's bones as they were scattered and buried. Moreover, he had a stormy passage; however, the difficulty in his task made his devotion seem even greater. The ashes were brought to [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], from where they were carried up the Tiber and brought to the [[Campus Martius]], from where equestrians placed them on briers to join the ashes of Germanicus in the mausoleum of Augustus. The move was reminiscent of when Agrippina carried the ashes of her husband just over 17 years earlier. Agrippina's funerary urn still survives ({{CIL|06|886}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|p=84}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nAgrippina was fiercely independent, a trait she shared with her mother. Dio described her as having ambitions to match her pedigree. However, [[Anthony Barrett]] notes that Agrippina was fully aware that a woman in ancient Rome could not hold power in her own right. Instead, Agrippina followed the model of Livia in promoting the careers of her children.<ref name=Barrett41/>\n\nShe and her daughter, Agrippina the Younger, are both described as being equally ambitious for their sons. Whereas the elder Agrippina's son failed to become emperor, the younger Agrippina's son, also named Nero, succeeds. In a contrast, Tacitus has Agrippina the Elder merely standing on a bridge waving the soldiers passing by, whereas her daughter eclipses her by presiding over a [[military tribunal]] and accepting gifts from foreign ambassadors.<ref name=\"L'Hoir131\">{{harvnb|L'Hoir|2006|p=131}}</ref>\n\nTacitus also records serious tension between Agrippina and Livia. He describes Livia as having visited \"stepmotherly provocations\" on Agrippina. He says of Agrippina: \"were it not that through her moral integrity and love for her husband she converted an otherwise ungovernable temper to the good\" (Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 1.33).<ref>{{harvnb|MacLachlan|2013|p=135}}</ref> Despite being sympathetic to her as a victim of imperial oppression, he uses expressions like \"excitable\", \"arrogant\", \"proud\", \"fierce\", \"obstinate\", and \"ambitious\" to describe Agrippina. His comments are echoed by other sources.<ref name=Barrett41/> \n\n==Historiography==\nHistorian Lindsay Powell says Agrippina enjoyed a normal marriage and continued to show her devotion to Germanicus after his death. He says she was regarded by the Roman people as, quoting Tacitus, \"the glory of the country, the sole surviving offspring of Augustus, the solitary example of the good old times.\"<ref name=Powell194/>\n\nAlston cautions against accepting the stories of Agrippina's feud with Sejanus at face value, as these accounts reflect a tradition hostile to Tiberius and Sejnaus. They may have been circulated by Agrippina's supporters or they may have emerged after Sejanus' fall in AD 31. He adds: \"These stories are plausible, though not certain to be true.\"<ref name=Alston31/>\n\n===Suetonius===\n{{main|The Twelve Caesars}}\nAugustus was proud of Agrippina. Suetonius claims that Augustus wrote her a letter praising her intellect and directing her education. Suetonius also records that Augustus, who held strict views on self-restraint and respectable speech, cautioned Agrippina not to speak \"offensively\". When she next appears, she is being chastised by Tiberius in [[Greek language|Greek]] for making irritating remarks, and the tone of the Greek verse quoted by Tiberius suggests that she should have heeded the advice of her grandfather not to speak offensively.<ref name=Salisbury3/><ref name=Barrett41>{{harvnb|Barrett|2015|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|Gibson|2014|pp=55-56}}</ref>\n\n===Tacitus===\n{{main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'' of Tacitus is a history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty beginning with the death of Augustus. In it, he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics. The women of the imperial family in particular are depicted by Tacitus as having a notable prominence in the public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it. Tacitus presents them as living longer than the imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age. Among the most broad of his portrayals is that of Agrippina. He emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to Augustus, a significant factor in the marriages of the emperors and princes of the dynasty. The Annals repeatedly has Agrippina competing for influence with Tacitus simply because she is related to Augustus biologically.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldherr|2009|pp=285-6}}</ref>\n\nTacitus presents Agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males,<ref name=\"L'Hoir131\"/> and has her reversing gender roles, which showcases her assumption of male ''[[auctoritas]]'' (\"authority\") with metaphors of her dressing and undressing. In an example of Agrippina assuming ''auctoritas'', he says:<ref>{{harvnb|L'Hoir|2006|pp=136-7}}</ref> {{Verse translation|lang=la|''Sed femina ingens animi munia ducis per eos dies induit militibusque, ut quis inops aut saucius, vestem et fomenta dilargita est. tradit C.

He records her as having reversed the natural order of things when she quelled the mutiny of the Rhine in AD 14. In so doing, he describes her as having usurped her husband's power, a power rightfully belonging only to a general.<ref>{{harvnb|L'Hoir|2006|p=130}}</ref>\n\n==Portraiture==\n[[File:The Gemma Claudia, a Roman five-layered onyx cameo of ca. 49 AD depicting Claudius and Agrippina the Younger (left), Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder (right), Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum, Austria (21885155418).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Gemma Claudia]] (AD 50) depicting Claudius (front left), Agrippina the Younger (back left), Germanicus (front right), and Agrippina the Elder (back right).<ref group=note>It has also been proposed that the two on the right are Tiberius and Livia {{harv|Fischer|2016|p=54}}; however historian Kleiner notes that Claudius and Agrippina the Younger would probably be paired with another married couple, i.e., pairing them with a mother and son would be an unusual juxtaposition. In addition, if the man on the right were Tiberius, it is unlikely he would be depicted as being so young {{harv|Kleiner|2016|p=143}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kleiner|2016|p=143}}</ref>]]\nPortraits of Roman women from the Julio-Claudian dynasty display a freer hair treatment then those of traditional Roman men and are more keen on the sensitivity of recording on different textures. These changes in style served to make reproducing them more popular in the mid-first-century AD. Reproductions of her image would continue to be made into that period. In the portrait, she is given a youthful face despite the fact that she lived to middle age. Agrippina's hair is a mass of curls that covers both sides of her head and is long going down to her shoulders. Her portraiture can be contrasted with that of Livia who had a more austere Augustan hairstyle.<ref>{{harvnb|Kleiner|2016|p=139}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different periods during the first-century AD when portraits were created for Agrippina: at the time of her marriage to Germanicus (which made her the mother of a potential emperor); when her son Caligula came into power in AD 37, and collected her ashes from the island of Pandateria for relocation to the Mausoleum of Augustus; and at the time of Claudius' marriage to [[Antonia Minor]], who wanted to connect himself to the lineage of Augustus by evoking Agrippina's image. Coins and inscriptions cannot act as a method of discerning her age, because her hairstyle remains unchanged in all the representations.<ref name=Giroire73>{{harvnb|Giroire|Roger|2007|p=73}}</ref>\n\nThe easiest phase of portraits to identify are those dating to the time of Caligula, when a fair abundance of coins were minted with an image of his mother on them. It is a posthumous portrait of her with idealized features. In the phase following Claudius' marriage, her features are made to more closely resemble those of her daughter. The goal was to strengthen Agrippina the Younger's connection with her mother. Finally, the portraits of her dating to the time of Tiberius are still idealized, but not as much as those from the period of Caligula's reign.

Her father was [[Germanicus]], a popular general and one-time heir apparent to the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Tiberius]]; and her mother was [[Agrippina the Elder]], a granddaughter of the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. She was also the younger sister of [[Caligula]], as well as the niece and fourth wife of [[Claudius]].\n\nBoth ancient and modern sources describe Agrippina's personality as ruthless, ambitious, violent, and domineering. Physically she was a beautiful and reputable woman; according to [[Pliny the Elder]], she had a double canine in her upper right jaw, a sign of good fortune. Many ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning her husband Claudius, though accounts vary.<ref name = \"yyroia\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' XII.66; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXI.34; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius 44; Josephus is less sure, Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XX.8.1</ref> In AD 59 Agrippina was executed on the orders of her son, the emperor [[Nero]].\n\n==Family==\n{{Further|Julio-Claudian family tree}}\nAgrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of [[Agrippina the Elder]] and [[Germanicus]]. She had three elder brothers, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero Caesar]], [[Drusus Caesar]] and the future Emperor [[Caligula]], and two younger sisters, [[Julia Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla]]. Agrippina's two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].\n\nShe was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of [[Julia the Elder]] and the statesman [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. The father of Julia the Elder was the Emperor [[Augustus]], and Julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to [[Scribonia]], who had close blood relations with [[Pompey the Great]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Maternally, Agrippina descended directly from Augustus.\n\nGermanicus, Agrippina's father, was a very popular general and politician. His mother was [[Antonia Minor]] and his father was the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. He was Antonia Minor's first child. Germanicus had two younger siblings; a sister, named [[Livilla (sister of Claudius)|Livilla]], and a brother, the future Emperor [[Claudius]]. Claudius was Agrippina's paternal uncle and third husband.\n\nAntonia Minor was a daughter to [[Octavia the Younger]] by her second marriage to triumvir [[Mark Antony]], and Octavia was the second eldest sister and full-blooded sister of Augustus. Germanicus' father, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus the Elder]], was the second son of the Empress [[Livia]] Drusilla by her first marriage to praetor [[Tiberius Nero]], and was the Emperor [[Tiberius]]'s younger brother and Augustus's stepson. In the year 9, Augustus ordered and forced Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, who happened to be Tiberius's nephew, as his son and heir. Germanicus was a favorite of his great-uncle Augustus, who hoped that Germanicus would succeed his uncle Tiberius, who was Augustus's own adopted son and heir. This in turn meant that Tiberius was also Agrippina's adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great-uncle.\n\n==Birth and early life==\nAgrippina was born on 6 November in AD 15, or possibly 14, at Oppidum Ubiorum, a Roman outpost on the [[Rhine]] River located in present-day [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].<ref>Gaius Stern, \"Caligula's Three Sisters\" suggests that the sisters of Caligula were born at two-year intervals \u2013 Agrippina in 14, Drusilla in 16, and Livilla in 18, ''contra'' Suetonius \"the girls were born in three consecutive years.\"  Tac. ''Ann'' 2.54 disproves Suetonius' claim, placing Livilla's birthday in 18.  Note the births of Agrippina the Younger and Drusilla are only 10 months apart if Suetonius is correct.  But Drusilla was clearly born in 18.</ref> A second sister Julia [[Drusilla]] was born on 16 September 16, also in Germany.<ref>Lindsay Powell ''Germanicus'' (Pen and Sword 2013), 116, cites {{CIL|6|5201}} = ''ILS'' 1837, {{CIL|5|5722}} = ''ILS'' 194, {{CIL|12|1026}} = ''ILS'' 195, for the birth and location of Julia Drusilla.</ref>  As a small child, Agrippina travelled with her parents throughout Germany (15\u201316) until she and her siblings (apart from Caligula) returned to Rome to live with and be raised by their maternal grandmother Antonia.  Her parents departed for [[Syria]] in 18 to conduct official duties, and, according to Tacitus, the third and youngest sister was born en route on the island of Lesbos, namely [[Julia Livilla]], probably in March 18.<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 2.54.  See also local inscriptions found by Lindsay Powell ''Germanicus'' (Pen and Sword 2013), p. 132 n. 96, {{CIL|6|3998}}, {{CIL|6|10563}} and others, as well as local coins.</ref> In October of AD 19, Germanicus died suddenly in [[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]], [[Turkey]]).\n\nGermanicus' death caused much public grief in Rome, and gave rise to rumors that he had been [[murder]]ed by [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] and [[Munatia Plancina]] on the orders of Tiberius, as his widow Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with his ashes. Agrippina the Younger was thereafter supervised by her mother, her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor, and her great-grandmother, [[Livia]], all of them notable, influential, and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive. She lived on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]]. Her great-uncle Tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of Augustus in 14.\n\n==Marriage to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus==\n[[File:Domizio enobarbo, padre di nerone, busto di restauro, inv. 2222.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bust of [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]]]]\nAfter her thirteenth birthday in 28, Tiberius arranged for Agrippina to marry her paternal first cousin once removed [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in [[Rome]].<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 4.75.</ref> Domitius came from a distinguished family of [[Ahenobarbus|consular rank]]. Through his mother [[Antonia Major]], Domitius was a great nephew of Augustus, first cousin to Claudius, and first cousin once removed to Agrippina and Caligula. He had two sisters; [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]] and [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]]. Domitia Lepida the Younger was the mother of the Empress [[Valeria Messalina]].\n\nAntonia Major was the elder sister to Antonia Minor, and the first daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. According to Suetonius, Domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character, who, according to Suetonius, was \"a man who was in every aspect of his life detestable\" and served as consul in 32. Agrippina and Domitius lived between [[Antium]] (modern [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]]<ref>Paola Brandizzi Vittucci, ''Antium: Anzio e Nettuno in epoca romana'', Roma, Bardi, 2000.</ref>) and Rome. Not much is known about the relationship between them.\n\n==Reign of Caligula==\n[[File:Caligula sestertius RIC 33 680999.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|During the reign of [[Caligula]], coins like the one pictured here were issued depicting his three sisters, Drusilla, Livilla, and Agrippina the Younger]]\n\nTiberius died on March 16, AD 37, and Agrippina's only surviving brother, [[Caligula]], became the new emperor. Being the emperor's sister gave Agrippina some influence.\n\nAgrippina and her younger sisters [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Livilla]] received various honours from their brother, which included but were not limited to:\n\n* They were given the rights of the [[Vestal Virgin]]s like the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium.\n* Coins were issued depicting images of Caligula and his sisters. Roman coins like these were never issued beforehand. The coins depicted Caligula on one side and his sisters on the opposite.\n* Caligula added his sisters' names to motions. In loyalty oaths, it was, \"I will not value my life or that of my children less highly than I do the safety of the Emperor and his sisters,\" or, if in consular motions: \"Good fortune attend to the Emperor and his sisters.\"\n\nAround the time that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. In the early morning hours in Antium of December 15, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after the Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor [[Nero]]. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied \"I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people\".\n\nCaligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships. On June 10, AD 38, Drusilla died, possibly of a fever, rampant in Rome at the time. He was particularly fond of Drusilla, claiming to treat her as he would [[Lollia Paulina|his own wife]], even though Drusilla had a [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|husband]]. Following her death Caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane.\n\nIn 39, Agrippina and Livilla, with their maternal cousin, Drusilla's widower [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], were involved in a failed plot to murder Caligula, a plot known as the ''Plot of the Three Daggers'', which was to make Lepidus the new emperor. Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were accused of being lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it. At the trial of Lepidus, Caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses, producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him.\n\n=== Exile ===\nLepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled by their brother to the [[Pontine Islands]]. Caligula sold their furniture, jewellery, slaves and freedmen. In January of AD 40, Domitius died of [[edema]] (dropsy) at Pyrgi. Lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]] after Caligula had taken his inheritance away from him.\n\nCaligula, his wife [[Milonia Caesonia]] and their daughter [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] were murdered on January 24, 41. Agrippina's paternal uncle, [[Claudius]], brother of her father [[Germanicus]], became the new Roman Emperor.\n\n==Reign of Claudius==\n\n===Return from exile===\n[[File:Messalinaandbritannicus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Messalina]] holding her son [[Britannicus]] ([[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]])]]\n[[Claudius]] lifted the exiles of Agrippina and Livilla. Livilla returned to her husband, while Agrippina was reunited with her estranged son. After the death of her first husband, Agrippina tried to make shameless advances to the future emperor [[Galba]], who showed no interest in her and was devoted to his wife [[Aemilia Lepida]]. On one occasion, Galba's mother-in-law gave Agrippina a public reprimand and a slap in the face before a whole bevy of married women.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html C. Suetonius Tranquillus] Suetonius. Twelve Caesars: Galba.</ref>\n\nClaudius had Lucius' inheritance reinstated. Lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]] divorced Lucius' aunt, [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]] (Lucius' first paternal aunt) so that Crispus could marry Agrippina. They married, and Crispus  became a step-father to Lucius. Crispus was a prominent, influential, witty, wealthy and powerful man, who served twice as consul. He was the adopted grandson and biological great-great-nephew of the historian [[Sallust]]. Little is known on their relationship, but Crispus soon died and left his estate to Nero.\n\nIn the first years of Claudius' reign, Claudius was married to the infamous Empress [[Valeria Messalina]]. Although Agrippina was very influential, she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor. Messalina was Agrippina's second paternal cousin. Among the victims of Messalina's intrigues were Agrippina's surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with having adultery with [[Seneca the Younger]]. Seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to Nero.\n\nMessalina considered Agrippina's son a threat to her son's position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins fled in terror when they saw a snake suddenly dart from beneath Lucius' pillow\u2014but it was only a sloughed-off snake-skin in his bed, near his pillow.\n\nIn 47, Crispus died, and at his funeral, the rumor spread around that Agrippina poisoned Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year at the [[Secular Games]], at the performance of the Troy Pageant, Messalina attended the event with her son Britannicus. Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and [[Britannicus]] did. Many people began to show pity and sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life. Agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family (casus suorum) and wrote an account of her mother's life.\n\n===Rise to power===\nAfter Messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with [[Gaius Silius]] to overthrow her husband, Claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time. Around this time, Agrippina became the mistress to one of Claudius' advisers, the former Greek Freedman [[Pallas (freedman)|Marcus Antonius Pallas]]. At that time Claudius' advisers were discussing which noblewoman Claudius should marry. Claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded. In more recent times, it has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage between Agrippina and Claudius to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.<ref>Scramuzza (1940) pp.&nbsp;91\u201392. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.</ref> This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of Germanicus, actions which Tiberius had gladly punished.\n\nClaudius made references to her in his speeches: \"my daughter and foster child, born and bred, in my lap, so to speak\". When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered incestuous, and obviously immoral.\n\n==== Marriage to Claudius ====\nAgrippina and Claudius married on New Year's Day, 49. This marriage caused widespread disapproval. This was a part of Agrippina's scheming plan to make Lucius the new emperor. Her marriage to Claudius was not based on love, but on power. She quickly eliminated her rival [[Lollia Paulina]]. Shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina charged Paulina with [[black magic]]. Paulina did not receive a hearing. Her property was confiscated.  She left Italy and, on Agrippina's orders, committed suicide.\n\nIn the months leading up to her marriage to Claudius, Agrippina's maternal second cousin, the [[praetor]] [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus]], was betrothed to Claudius' daughter [[Claudia Octavia]]. This betrothal was broken off in 48, when Agrippina, scheming with the consul [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the father of the future Emperor [[Aulus Vitellius]], falsely accused Silanus of incest with his sister [[Junia Calvina]]. Agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between Octavia and her son. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office.\n\nSilanus committed suicide on the day that Agrippina married her uncle, and Calvina was exiled from [[Italy]] in early 49. Calvina was called back from exile after the death of Agrippina. Towards the end of 54, Agrippina would order the murder of Silanus' eldest brother [[Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus (consul  46)|Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus]] without Nero's knowledge, so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brother's death.\n\n==Empress of Rome==\n\nOn the day that Agrippina married her uncle Claudius as her third husband/his fourth wife, she became an Empress and the most powerful woman in the [[Roman Empire]]. She also was a stepmother to [[Claudia Antonia]], Claudius' daughter and only child from his second marriage to [[Aelia Paetina]], and to the young [[Claudia Octavia]] and [[Britannicus]], Claudius' children with Valeria Messalina. Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius' second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]].\n\nIn 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the [[Celts|Celtic]] King [[Caratacus]] bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor. In 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. She was only the third Roman woman ([[Livia]] Drusilla and [[Antonia Minor]] received this title) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Antonia) to receive this title.\n\nAlso that year, Claudius had founded a Roman colony and called the colony ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis'' or ''Agrippinensium'', today known as [[Cologne]], after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a ''carpentum'' which she used. A carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, and sacred statues. That same year she appointed [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]] as the head of the [[Praetorian Guard]], replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, [[Rufrius Crispinus]].\n\nAncient sources claim that Agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced Claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in 50. Lucius' name was changed to ''[[Nero]] Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus'' and he became Claudius's adopted son, heir and recognised successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to Octavia, and Agrippina arranged to have [[Seneca the Younger]] return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XII.25</ref>\n\nAgrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in 51, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus' tutor Sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by Claudius' adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor, instead of choosing his own son Britannicus.<ref>Some compare this to when Tiberius had chosen Caligula and the other grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] \"without any approbation.\"  Why would there be any approbation?  Tiberius had few descendants and Gemellus was the youngest of all of them.  First Tiberius designated the older brothers of Caligula (his adopted son's sons) as his successors. Later he accused and imprisoned them.  All he had left was Caligula (by then over 20) and Gemellus (under 10).  There would be more approbation for overlooking Caligula in Gemellus' favor.</ref>\n\nNero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing him for the throne. His actions allegedly gave Agrippina a motive to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 with a plate of deadly [[mushroom]]s at a banquet, thus enabling [[Nero]] to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources, it is possible (but exceedingly convenient) that Claudius died of natural causes; Claudius was 63 years old.<ref name = \"yyroia\"/>\n\n==Reign of Nero==\n\n===Power struggle between mother and son===\n[[File:Ner\u00f3n y Agripina.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Sculpture of Agrippina crowning her young son Nero (c. 54\u201359&nbsp;AD)]]\n[[File:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Marble bust of [[Nero]]. Antiquarium of the Palatine.]]\nAgrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified Claudius. She was allowed to visit senate meetings, watching and hearing the meetings from behind a curtain. \n\nIn the first months of Nero's reign Agrippina controlled her son and the Empire. She lost control over Nero when he began to have an affair with the freed woman [[Claudia Acte]], which Agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for. Agrippina began to support [[Britannicus]] in her attempt to make him emperor. Britannicus was secretly poisoned on Nero's orders during his own banquet in February 55. The power struggle between Agrippina and her son had begun. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAgrippina between 55 and 58 became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son. In 55, Agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence. Nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards. Nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the Greek Island of [[Rhodes]], a place where [[Tiberius]] had lived after divorcing [[Julia the Elder]]. Pallas also was dismissed from the court. The fall of Pallas and the opposition of Burrus and Seneca, contributed to Agrippina's loss of authority.<ref name=power>Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth \u2013 E.A. (edd.), [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[Oxford]], 2003</ref>\n\nTowards 57, Agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in [[Misenum]]. While Agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to Rome, Nero sent people to annoy her. Although living in Misenum, she was still very popular, powerful and influential. Agrippina and Nero would see each other on short visits. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Wallbrecht |first1=Colonel Donald A. |title=Ad Britannia Ii: First Century Roman Britannia |date=2017 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=9781490783871}}</ref>\n\n===Death and aftermath===\nThe circumstances that surround Agrippina's death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti-Nero bias. All surviving stories of Agrippina's death contradict themselves and each other, and are generally fantastical.\n\n====Tacitus's account====\nAccording to [[Tacitus]], in 58, Nero became involved with the noble woman [[Poppaea Sabina]]. With the reasoning that a divorce from Octavia and a marriage to Poppaea was not politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero decided to kill Agrippina.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.1</ref> Yet, Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62, calling into question this motive.<ref>See Dawson, Alexis, \"Whatever Happened to Lady Agrippina?\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' (1969) p. 264</ref>  Additionally, [[Suetonius]] reveals that Poppaea's husband, [[Otho]], was not sent away by Nero until after Agrippina's death in 59, making it highly unlikely that already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Caesars'', Life of Otho 3</ref> Some modern historians theorize that Nero's decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Gaius [[Rubellius Plautus]] (Nero's maternal second cousin) or [[Britannicus]] (Claudius' biological son) on the throne.<ref>Rogers, Robert. ''Heirs and Rivals to Nero'', Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 86. (1955), p. 202. Silana accuses Agrippina of plotting to bring up Plautus in 55, Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIII.19; Silana is recalled from exile after Agrippina's power waned, Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.12; Plautus is exiled in 60, Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.22</ref>\n\nTacitus claims that Nero considered poisoning or stabbing her, but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious, so he settled on \u2013 after the advice of his former tutor [[Anicetus (admiral)|Anicetus]] \u2013 building a self-sinking boat.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.3</ref> Though aware of the plot, Agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceiling's fall.<ref name = \"lpygle\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.5</ref> Though the collapsing ceiling missed Agrippina, it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm.<ref name = \"lpygle\"/>\n\nThe boat failed to sink from the lead ceiling, so the crew then sank the boat, but Agrippina swam to shore.<ref name = \"lpygle\"/> Her friend, [[Acerronia Polla]], was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water, and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned, since she was exclaiming that she was Agrippina, with the intention of being saved. She did not know, however, that this was an assassination attempt, not a mere accident. Agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers.<ref name = \"eezojs\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.8</ref> News of Agrippina's survival reached Nero so he sent three assassins to kill her.<ref name = \"eezojs\"/>\n\n====Suetonius's account====\nSuetonius says that Agrippina's 'over-watchful' and 'over-critical' eye she kept over Nero drove him to murdering her. After months of attempting to humiliate her by depriving her of her power, honour and her bodyguard. He also expelled her from the Palantine followed by the people he sent to 'pester' her with lawsuits give her 'jeers and catcalls'. \n\nWhen he eventually turned to murder, he first tried poison, three times in fact. She prevented her death by taking the antidote in advance. Afterwards, he rigged up a machine in her room which would drop her ceiling tiles onto her as she slept, however, she once again escaped her death after she received word of the plan. Nero's, final plan was to get her in a boat which would collapse and sink. \n\nHe sent her a friendly letter asking to reconcile and inviting her to celebrate the Quinquatrus at Baiae with him. He arranged an \"accidental\" collision between her galley and one of his captains. When returning home, he offered her his collapsible boat, as opposed to her damaged galley. \n\nThe next day, Nero received word of her survival after the boat sank from her freedman Agermus. Panicking, Nero ordered a guard to 'surreptitiously' drop a blade behind Agermus and Nero immediately had him arrested on account of attempted murder. Nero ordered the assassination of Agrippina. He made it look as if Agrippina had committed suicide after her plot to kill Nero had been uncovered. \n\nAfter Agrippina's death, Suetonius says that Nero examined Agrippina's corpse and discussed her good and bad points. \n\nIt is said that Nero believed Agrippina to haunt him after her death.\n\n====Cassius Dio's account====\nThe tale of [[Cassius Dio]] is also somewhat different. It starts again with Poppaea as the motive behind the murder.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.11</ref>  Nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea.<ref name = \"hltdlf\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.12</ref>  Agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up, she fell into the water.<ref name = \"hltdlf\"/> Agrippina swam to shore so Nero sent an assassin to kill her.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.13</ref>  Nero then claimed Agrippina plotted to kill him and committed suicide.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.14</ref> Her reputed [[last words]], uttered as the assassin was about to strike, were \"Smite my womb\", the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so \"abominable a son.\"<ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'', p. 687</ref>\n\n====Burial====\nAfter Agrippina's death, Nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was, according to some.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.9</ref> Her body was cremated that night on a dining couch. At his mother's funeral, Nero was witless, speechless and rather scared. When the news spread that Agrippina had died, the Roman army, senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mother's plots.\n\n====Aftermath====\nDuring the remainder of Nero's reign, Agrippina's grave was not covered or enclosed. Her household later on gave her a modest tomb in [[Misenum]]. Nero would have his mother's death on his conscience. He felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother. He even saw his mother's ghost and got [[Persia]]n magicians to scare her away. Years before she died, Agrippina had visited [[astrologer]]s to ask about her son's future. The astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her. She replied, \"Let him kill me, provided he becomes emperor,\" according to [[Tacitus]].\n\n===== Agrippina's alleged victims =====\n* '''47'''\n** ''Passienus Crispus'': Agrippina's 2nd husband, poisoned (Suet.).\n* '''49'''\n** ''Lollia Paulina'': as she was a rival for Claudius' hand in marriage as proposed by the freedman Callistus (Tac. & Dio).\n** ''Lucius Silanus'': betrothed to Octavia, Claudius' daughter before his marriage of Agrippina.

This can be seen in the use of [[carrot]]s and [[tomato]]es.  Cuisine in China makes frequent use of Asian [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[bok choy]] and [[kai-lan]] and puts a greater emphasis on fresh [[meat]] and [[seafood]].<ref name = \"Oxford\">{{cite book   | title = The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink | author= Andrew F.

The food also has a reputation for high levels of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] to enhance the flavor. Market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer \"MSG Free\" or \"No MSG\" menus, or to omit this ingredient on request.<ref name = \"Oxford\"/>\n\n[[File:FriedWonton.jpg|thumb|Carryout Chinese food is commonly served in a paper carton with a wire bale, known as an [[oyster pail]].]]\nAmerican Chinese cuisine makes use of ingredients not native to and very rarely used in China. One such example is the common use of Western [[broccoli]] ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d|p=x\u012bl\u00e1n}}) instead of Chinese broccoli ([[Gai-lan]], {{zh|t=\u82a5\u862d|p=ji\u00e8l\u00e1n|labels=no}}) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally, Western broccoli is also referred to as ''{{lang|yue|{{tonesup|sai1 laan4 fa1}}}}'' in Cantonese ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d\u82b1|labels=no}}) in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified.\n\nThis is also the case with the words for [[carrot]] (''luo buo'' or ''lo baak,'' or ''hong luo buo'', ''hong'' meaning \"red\") and [[onion]] (''yang cong''). ''Lo baak'', in [[Cantonese]], refers to a large, pungent white [[radish]]. The orange Western carrot is known in some areas of China as \"foreign [[radish]]\" (or more properly ''hung lo baak'' in Cantonese, ''hung'' meaning \"red\"). When the word for onion, ''yang cong'', is used, it is understood that one is referring to \"green onions\" (otherwise known to English-speakers as \"[[scallion]]s\" or \"spring onions\"). The larger, many-layered onion [[bulb]] common in the United States is called ''yang cong''. This translates as \"Western onion\". These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China, and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of China.\n\n[[Yeung Chow Fried Rice|Egg fried rice]] in American Chinese cuisine is also prepared differently, with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce. Some food styles, such as [[dim sum]], were also modified to fit American palates, such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce.<ref name = \"Oxford\"/>\n\n[[Salad]]s containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional Chinese cuisine, as are Japanese style [[sushi]] or [[sashimi]].  However, an increasing number of American Chinese restaurants, including some upscale establishments, have started to offer these items in response to customer demand.\n\n[[Ming Tsai]], the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and host of [[PBS]] culinary show ''[[Simply Ming]]'', said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have [[chop suey]], or have \"fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce\", \"eight different sweet and sour dishes\", or \"a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes\". Tsai said \"Chinese-American cuisine is 'dumbed-down' Chinese food. It\u2019s adapted... to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public\".<ref>\"[https://cnneatocracy.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/chef-ming-tsai-wants-you-to-have-a-chinese-friend/ Chef Ming Tsai wants you to have a Chinese friend].\" [[CNN]].

If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature items such as [[liver (food)|liver]], [[chicken feet]], or other meat dishes that might deter American customers.

Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.\n\n===North American versions found in China===\n[[File:Egg foo young.JPG|thumb|Egg foo young]]\n* [[Cashew chicken]] \u2013 Stir fried tender chicken pieces with cashews.\n* [[Chow mein]] \u2013 literally means \"stir-fried [[noodle]]s\". Chow mein consists of fried crispy noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. It can come with chicken, pork, shrimp or beef.\n* [[Egg foo young]] \u2013 a Chinese-style omelet with vegetables and meat, usually served with a brown gravy. While some restaurants in North America deep-fry the omelet, versions found in Asia are more likely to fry in the wok.\n* [[Egg roll]] \u2013 while [[spring roll]]s have a thin, light beige crispy skin that flakes apart, and is filled with mushrooms, [[bamboo]], and other vegetables inside, the American-style egg roll has a thicker, chewier, dark brown bubbly skin stuffed with cabbage and usually bits of meat or seafood (such as pork or shrimp), but no egg.\n* [[Fried rice]] \u2013 fried rice dishes are popular offerings in American Chinese food due to the speed and ease of preparation and their appeal to American tastes. Fried rice is generally prepared with rice cooled overnight, allowing restaurants to put  leftover rice to good use (freshly cooked rice is actually less suitable for fried rice). The Chinese American version of this dish typically uses more soy sauce than the versions found in China. Fried rice is offered with different combinations of meat and vegetables.\n* [[Ginger beef]] \u2013 ({{zh|t=\u751f\u8591\u725b\u8089|p=sh\u0113ngji\u0101ng ni\u00far\u00f2u|labels=no}}) Tender beef cut in chunks, mixed with ginger and Chinese mixed vegetables.\n* [[Ginger fried beef]] \u2013 ({{zh|t=\u4e7e\u7092\u725b\u8089\u7d72|p=g\u0101nch\u01ceo ni\u00far\u00f2u-s\u012b|labels=no}}) Tender beef cut in strings, battered, deep dried, then re-fried in a wok mixed with a sweet sauce, a variation of a popular Northern Chinese dish.\n* [[Hulatang]] \u2013 a Chinese traditional soup with hot spices, often called \"spicy soup\" on menus\n* [[Kung Pao chicken]] \u2013 The  [[Sichuan]] dish is spicy hot, but the versions served in North America tend to be less so if at all, and sometimes leave out the [[Sichuan pepper]] that is a fundamental part of the original dish. \n* [[Lo mein]] (\"stirred noodles\"). These noodles are frequently made with eggs and flour, making them chewier than simply using water. Thick, spaghetti shaped noodles are pan fried with vegetables (mainly bok choy and Chinese cabbage ([[nappa cabbage|nappa]])) and meat. Sometimes this dish is referred to as \"chow mein\" (which literally means \"fried noodles\" in Cantonese).\n* [[Mei Fun]] (see [[Rice vermicelli]] dishes)\n* [[Moo shu pork]] \u2013 The original version uses more typically Chinese ingredients (including [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes while the American version uses vegetables more familiar to Americans, and thicker pancakes. This dish is quite popular in Chinese restaurants in the United States, but not so popular in China.\n* [[Orange chicken]] \u2013 chopped, battered, fried chicken with a sweet orange flavored chili sauce that is thickened and glazed. The traditional version consists of stir-fried chicken in a light, slightly sweet soy sauce that is flavored with dried orange peels.\n* [[Wonton soup]] \u2013 In most American Chinese restaurants, only wonton dumplings in broth are served, while versions found in China may come with noodles. In Canton, Wonton Soup can be a full meal in itself, consisting of thin egg noodles and several pork and prawn wontons in a pork or chicken soup broth or noodle broth. Especially in takeout restaurants, wonton are often made with thicker dough skins.\n*[[Beijing beef]] \u2013 In China, this dish uses ''[[gai-lan]]'' (Chinese broccoli) rather than American [[broccoli]].\n[[Image:Beef with broccoli.JPG|thumb|Beef with broccoli]]\n\n==Regional variations==\n\n===New York City===\nGiven that the [[New York City metropolitan area]] has become home to the largest [[overseas Chinese]] population outside of Asia,<ref name=NYCLargestChinesePopulation>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/nyregion/in-new-york-indictment-of-officer-peter-liang-divides-chinese-americans.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0|title=Indictment of New York Officer Divides Chinese-Americans|author=Vivian Yee|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name=queensbuzz>{{cite web|url=http://www.queensbuzz.com/flushing-neighborhood-corona-neighborhood-cms-302|title=Chinese New Year 2012 in Flushing|publisher=QueensBuzz.com|date=January 25, 2012|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}</ref> all popular styles of regional Chinese cuisine have commensurately become ubiquitously accessible in [[Chinese Americans in New York City|New York City]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/dining/30flushing.html|title=Let the Meals Begin: Finding Beijing in Flushing|author=Julia Moskin|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}</ref> including [[Hakka cuisine|Hakka]], [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]], [[Shanghai cuisine|Shanghainese]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunanese]], [[Szechuan cuisine|Szechuan]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Fujianese cuisine|Fujianese]], [[Xinjiang cuisine|Xinjiang]], [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]], and [[Korean Chinese cuisine]].

The growing [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston Chinatown]] accommodates [[Chinatown bus lines|Chinese-owned bus lines]] shuttling an increasing number of passengers to and from the numerous [[Chinese Americans in New York City|Chinatowns in New York City]], and this has led to some commonalities in the local Chinese cuisine derived from Chinese food in New York. A large immigrant [[Fujianese people|Fujianese]] immigrant population has made a home in Boston, leading to [[Fuzhou cuisine]] being readily available in Boston. An increasing [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] population has also been exerting an influence on Chinese cuisine in [[Greater Boston]]. Finally, innovative dishes incorporating chow mein and chop suey as well as [[farm-to-table|locally farmed]] produce and regionally procured [[seafood]] ingredients are found in Chinese as well as non-Chinese food in and around Boston.\n\n===Philadelphia===\nThe evolving American Chinese scene in [[Philadelphia]] exhibits commonalities with the Chinese cuisine scenes in both New York City and Boston. There is a growing Fujianese community in Philadelphia as well, and Fuzhou cuisine is readily available in the [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Philadelphia Chinatown]]. Like Boston, the emerging [[Vietnamese cuisine]] scene in Philadelphia is contributing to the milieu of Chinese cuisine.\n\n===Hawaii===\nHawaiian-Chinese food developed somewhat differently from Chinese cuisine in the [[continental United States]]. Owing to the diversity of Pacific ethnicities in Hawaii and the history of the [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese influence in Hawaii]], resident Chinese cuisine forms a component of the [[cuisine of Hawaii]], which is a [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of [[plate lunch]]es in Hawaii. The names of foods are different as well, such as ''[[Manapua]]'', from the Hawaiian contraction of \"Mea ono pua'a\" or \"delicious [[pork]] item\" from the dim sum ''bao'', though the meat is not necessarily pork.\n\n===Other regional American Chinese dishes===\n* [[Chow mein sandwich]] \u2013 sandwich of chow mein and gravy ([[Southeastern Massachusetts]]; [[Rhode Island]]).\n* [[Chop suey sandwich]] \u2013 sandwich of chicken chop suey on a hamburger bun ([[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]] of [[Massachusetts]]).\n* [[St. Paul sandwich]] \u2013 [[egg foo young]] patty in plain white [[sandwich bread]] ([[St. Louis, Missouri]]).\n* [[Springfield-style cashew chicken]] \u2013 a style of cashew chicken that combines breaded deep fried chicken, cashews, and oyster sauce.

In June 1729, the Abdali forces under Zulfiqar had surrendered to Nader Shah Afshar, the rising new ruler of Persia. However, they soon began a rebellion and took over Herat as well as Mashad. In July 1730, he defeated Ibrahim Khan, a military commander and brother of [[Nader Shah]]. This prompted Nader Shah to retake Mashad and also intervene in the power struggle of Harat. By July 1731, Zulfiqar returned to his capital [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]] where he had been serving as the [[List of governors of Farah|governor]] since 1726. A year later Nadir's brother Ibrahim Khan took control of Farah. During this time Zulfiqar and the young Durrani fled to Kandahar where they took refuge with the Ghiljis. They were later made political prisoners by [[Hussain Hotak]], the Ghilji ruler of the Kandahar region.<ref>Sarkar, p. 124</ref>\n\nNader Shah had been enlisting the Abdalis in his army since around 1729. After [[Siege of Kandahar|conquering Kandahar]] in 1738, Durrani and his brother Zulfiqar were freed and provided with leading careers in Nader Shah's administration. Zulfiqar was made Governor of [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] while Durrani remained working as Nader Shah's personal attendant. The Ghiljis, who are originally from the territories east of the Kandahar region, were expelled from Kandahar in order to resettle the Abdalis along with some [[Qizilbash]] and other Persians.<ref name=EofI>C.

The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue. However, Durrani was told that the Shah had been killed by one of his wives. Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Durrani rushed either to save the Shah or to confirm what happened. Upon reaching the Shah's tent, they were only to see his body and severed head. Having served him so loyally, the Abdalis wept at having failed their leader,<ref>[[Olaf Caroe]], ''The Pathans'' (1981 reprint)</ref> and headed back to Kandahar. Before the retreat to Kandahar, he had \"removed\" the royal seal from Nader Shah's finger and the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond tied \"around the arm of his deceased master\". On their way back to Kandahar, the Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Durrani as their new leader. Hence he \"assumed the insignia of royalty\" as the \"sovereign ruler of [[Afghanistan]]\".<ref name=\"AS\"/>\n{{quote|At the time of Nadir's death, he commanded a contingent of Abdali Pashtuns. Realizing that his life was in jeopardy if he stayed among the Persians who had murdered Nader Shah, he decided to leave the Persian camp, and with his 4,000 troops he proceeded to Qandahar. Along the way and by sheer luck, they managed to capture a caravan with booty from India. He and his troops were rich; moreover, they were experienced fighters. In short, they formed a formidable force of young Pashtun soldiers who were loyal to their high-ranking leader.<ref name=\"Vogelsang\"/>}}\n\nOne of Durrani's first acts as chief was to adopt the titles ''Padishah-i-Ghazi'' (\"victorious emperor\"), and ''Durr-i-Durrani'' (\"pearl of pearls\" or \"pearl of the age\").<ref name=\"LoC\"/>\n\n{{Campaigns of Ahmad Shah Durrani}}\n\n==Forming the last Afghan empire==\n{{Further information|Durrani Empire}}\n\nFollowing his predecessor, Durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow Durranis and other [[Pashtuns]], as well as [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Qizilbash]] and other Muslims.<ref name=\"EofI\"/> He began his military conquest by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the Ghiljis and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over Khorasan.

According to Jaswant Lal Mehta, Durrani aroused the Afghans \"religious passions\" to fire and \"sword into the land of infidels India.\" He crossed the [[Khyber pass]] in December 1747 with 40,000 troops for his first invasion of India.

The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh]] and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the forces of the Durrani Empire. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Durrani and his forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shahrukh Afshar|Shah Rukh]]. The city fell to the Afghans in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; the Afghan forces then pushed on into present-day Iran, capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751. Durrani then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire.

In 1751\u201352, the ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha Empire]].<ref name=\"Panipat\">Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.</ref> Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled large parts of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Durrani sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa [[Balaji Bajirao]] sent [[Raghunathrao]].

The early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of [[Sadashivrao Bhau]]. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a battle for control of northern India.

The area was subjected to [[Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang|Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims]]. Both the Buddhist Turkic Uyghurs and Muslim Turkic Karluks participated in the Turkification and conquest of the native Buddhist Indo-European inhabitants of the Tarim Basin. The Turkic Muslims then proceeded to conquer the Turkic Buddhists in Islamic holy wars and converted them to Islam. The mixture between the invading Mongoloid Turkic peoples and the native Caucasian Indo-European inhabitants resulted in the modern day Turkic speaking hybrid Europoid-East Asian inhabitants of Xinjiang. The Turkification was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic Kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway in the 20th century the Saka Iranic Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.<ref name=\"Millward2007\">{{cite book|author=James A.

The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the Afaqi Khoja inviting the 5th Dalai Lama, the leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation.

The Dzungars used a hostage arrangement to rule over the Tarim Basin, keeping as hostsges in Ili either the sons of the leaders like the Khojas and Khans or the leaders themselves. Although the Uighur's culture and religion was left alone, the Dzungars substantially exploited them economically .<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzG5llo3YCMC&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false eds.

They included water conservancy tax, draught animal tax, fruit tax, poll tax, land tax, tress and grass tax, gold and silver tax, and trade tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted a tax of 67,000 tangas of silver from the Kashgar people in [[Galdan Tseren]]'s reign, a five percent tax was imposed on foreign traders and a ten percent tax imposed on Muslim merchants, people had to pay a fruit tax if they owned orchards and merchants had to pay a copper and silver tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted 100,000 silver tangas in tax from Yarkand and slapped livestock, stain, commerce, and a gold tax on them. The Dzungars extracted 700 taels of gold, and also extracted cotton, copper, and cloth, from the six regions of Keriya, Kashgar, Khotan, Kucha, Yarkand, and Aksu as stated by Russian topographer Yakoff Filisoff. The Dzungars extracted over 50% of the wheat harvests of Muslims according to Qi-yi-shi (Chun Yuan), 30\u201340% of the wheat harvests of Muslims according to the Xiyu tuzhi, which labelled the tax as \"plunder\" of the Muslims. The Dzungars also extorted extra taxes on cotton, silver, gold, and traded goods from the Muslims besides making them pay the official tax. \"Wine, meat, and women\" and \"a parting gift\" were forcibly extracted from the Uighurs daily by the Dzungars who went to physically gather the taxes from the Uighur Muslims, and if they dissatisfied with what they received, they would rape women, and loot and steal property and livestock. Gold necklaces, diamonds, pearls, and precious stones from India were extracted from the Uighurs under D\u0101niy\u0101l Khoja by [[Tsewang Rabtan]] when his daughter was getting married.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzG5llo3YCMC&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q&f=false eds.

Trade, milling, and distilling taxes, corv\u00e9e labor, saffron, cotton, and grain were also extracted by the Dzungars from the Tarim Basin.

Many opponents of Dzungar rule like Uighurs and some dissident Dzungars escaped and defected to Qing China during 1737\u20131754 and provided the Qing with intelligence on the Dzungars and voiced their grievances.

He was buried in the city of Kandahar adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Cloak]], where a large [[tomb of Ahmad Shah Durrani|tomb]] was built. It has been described in the following way:\n{{quote|Under the shimmering turquoise dome that dominates the sand-blown city of Kandahar lies the body of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the young Kandahari warrior who in 1747 became the region's first Durrani king. The mausoleum is covered in deep blue and white tiles behind a small grove of trees, one of which is said to cure toothache, and is a place of pilgrimage. In front of it is a small mosque with a marble vault containing one of the holiest relics in the Islamic World, a ''kherqa'', the Sacred Cloak of Mohammed that was given to Ahmad Shah by [[Mir Muhammad Murad Beg|Mured Beg]], the Emir of [[Bokhara]]. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis but the mausoleum is open and there is a constant line of men leaving their sandals at the door and shuffling through to marvel at the surprisingly long marble tomb and touch the glass case containing Ahmad Shah's brass helmet. Before leaving they bend to kiss a length of pink velvet said to be from his robe. It bears the unmistakable scent of jasmine.<ref>Lamb, Christina (2002). ''The Sewing Circles of Herat''.

His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of the former Mughal province of [[Bengal]] in 1793. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|battle of Panipat]]. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'.<ref name=\"British library\">[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/afghanistan/afghanistancollection/afghansources/sources1747to1809.html \"Afghanistan 1747\u20131809: Sources in the India Office Records\"]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of India that might have halted British East India company's expansion.<ref name=\"British library\"/> [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] wrote of Ahmad Shah:\n{{quote|His military courage and activity are spoken of with admiration, both by his own subjects and the nations with whom he was engaged, either in wars or alliances.

Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some [[Pashtun tribes]] and those of other Durrani lineages. Until [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like [[Babur]] or [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and make India the base for his empire.\n\nIn Pakistan, a [[short-range ballistic missile]] [[Abdali-I]], is named in the honour of Ahmed Shah Abdali.<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GI03Df02.html Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Durrani's poetry==\n[[File:Flag of the Abdali Afghan Tribes.jpeg|thumb|The flag of Ahmad Shah Durrani.]]\n\nDurrani wrote a collection of [[ode]]s in his native [[Pashto language]].
