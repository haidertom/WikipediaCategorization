The senior squad currently competes at [[Torneo de la URBA|Top 12]], the first division of the [[Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] league system.\n\nThe club has ties with former [[association football|football]] club [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] because both were established by [[Buenos Aires English High School]] students.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{Main|Alumni Athletic Club}}\nThe first club with the name \"Alumni\" played [[association football]], having been found in 1898 by students of [[Buenos Aires English High School]] (BAEHS) along with director [[Alexander Watson Hutton]]. Originally under the name \"English High School A.C.\", the team would be later obliged by the [[Argentine Football Association|Association]] to change its name, therefore \"Alumni\" was chosen, following a proposal by Carlos Bowers, a former student of the school.\n\nAlumni was the most successful team during the first years of Argentine football, winning 10 of 14 [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|league championships]] contested. Alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country.<ref name=clarin>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/04/24/d-549894.htm \"En el nombre del f\u00fatbol\", ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'' newspaper, 2003-04-24]</ref> Alumni was reorganised in 1908, \"in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football\". This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as Lomas, Belgrano and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in [[1911 in Argentine football|1911]] and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913.\n\n===Rebirth through rugby===\nIn 1951 a group of BAEHS students asked school's alumni for permission to re-establish the name \"Alumni\" for a rugby union team. This request was immediately approved in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers, who had proposed the name \"Alumni\" to the original football team 50 years before.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121108143046/http://www.asociacionalumni.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&Itemid=71 \"Los comienzos de Alumni\" - club's official website] (Archive, 8 Nov 2012)</ref>\n\nThe team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires league]], reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentine rugby and its rivalry with [[Belgrano Athletic Club]] is one of the fiercest [[Local derby|local derbies]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. Alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Alumni won its first [[Nacional de Clubes]] title, defeating [[Jockey Club de Rosario]] 23-21 in the final.\n\n==Players==\n===Current roster===\nAs of January 2018:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Federico Lucca\n* Gaspar Baldunciel\n* Guido Cambareri\n* I\u00f1aki Etchegaray\n* Bernardo Quaranta\n* Tobias Moyano\n* Mariano Romanini\n* Santiago Montagner\n* Tomas Passerotti\n* Lucas Frana\n* Luca Sabato\n* Franco Batezzatti\n* Franco Sabato\n* Rafael Desanto\n* Nito Provenzano\n* Tomas Bivort\n* Juan.P Ceraso\n* Santiago Alduncin\n* Juan.P Anderson\n* Lucas Magnasco\n* Joaquin Diaz Luzzi\n* Felipe Martignone\n* Tomas Corneille\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Nacional de Clubes]] (1)''': 2002\n*'''[[Torneo de la URBA]] (5)''': 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 2001\n\n==See also==\n* [[Buenos Aires English High School]]\n* [[Alumni Athletic Club]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://asociacionalumni.com.ar/ Official website]\n\n{{Commons category|Asociaci\u00f3n Alumni}}\n\n{{URBA Top 12}}\n{{Alumni Athletic Club}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asociacion Alumni}}\n[[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1951]]\n[[Category:Argentine rugby union teams]]", "sha1": "ge5980vwj12fgeb97xdtovpkowavbdr"}}, {"title": "Alumna", "ns": "0", "id": "926", "redirect": {"title": "Alumnus"}, "revision": {"id": "769390893", "parentid": "599656366", "timestamp": "2017-03-09T06:31:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "AddWittyNameHere", "id": "19382112"}, "comment": "Convert deprecated template.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Alumnus]]\n\n{{Rcat shell|\n{{R from related word}}\n{{R from gender}}\n}}", "sha1": "e5wwhndysxm1gfd71meqjz6f9w2qptw"}}, {"title": "Axiom", "ns": "0", "id": "928", "revision": {"id": "865786596", "parentid": "865786461", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T04:01:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "comment": "/* See also */ ?", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|axioms as used in logic and in mathematics}}\n{{Redirect|Axiomatic}}\n{{redirect|Axioms|the academic journal|Axioms (journal)}}\n{{redirect|Postulation|the term in algebraic geometry|Postulation (algebraic geometry)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\nAn '''axiom''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is taken to be [[truth|true]], to serve as a [[premise]] or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek ''ax\u00ed\u014dma'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1}}}}) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.'<ref>Cf. axiom, n., etymology.

As defined in [[classic philosophy]], an axiom is a statement that is so [[Self-evidence|evident]] or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.<ref>\"A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law\" axiom, n., definition 1a.

''Oxford English Dictionary'' Online, accessed 2012-04-28.</ref> \n \nAs used in [[mathematics]], the term ''axiom'' is used in two related but distinguishable senses: [[#Logical axioms|\"logical axioms\"]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|\"non-logical axioms\"]]. Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define (e.g., (''A'' and ''B'') implies ''A''), often shown in symbolic form, while non-logical axioms (e.g., {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}) are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as [[arithmetic]]). When used in the latter sense, \"axiom\", \"postulate\", and \"assumption\" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory.  To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.\n\nAny axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived.  Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be \"true\" is a subject of debate in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].<ref>See for example {{cite journal|first=Penelope|last=Maddy|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|title=Believing the Axioms, I|volume=53|issue=2|date=Jun 1988|pages=481\u2013511|doi=10.2307/2274520}} for a [[mathematical realism|realist]] view.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1}} (''ax\u00ed\u014dma''), a [[verbal noun]] from the verb {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''axioein''), meaning \"to deem worthy\", but also \"to require\", which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} (''\u00e1xios''), meaning \"being in balance\", and hence \"having (the same) value (as)\", \"worthy\", \"proper\". Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.\n\nThe root meaning of the word ''postulate'' is to \"demand\"; for instance, [[Euclid]] demands that one agree that some things can be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc.<ref>Wolff, P. ''Breakthroughs in Mathematics'', 1963, New York: New American Library, pp&nbsp;47\u201348</ref>\n\nAncient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, [[Proclus]] remarks that, \"[[Geminus]] held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property.\"<ref>[[T. L. Heath|Heath, T.]] 1956. The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements. New York: Dover. ''p 200''</ref> [[Boethius]] translated 'postulate' as ''petitio'' and called the axioms  ''notiones communes'' but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.\n\n==Historical development==\n\n===Early Greeks===\nThe logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments ([[syllogisms]], rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. [[tautology (logic)|Tautologies]] excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ([[theorem]]s, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms ''axiom'' and ''postulate'' hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].\n\nThe ancient Greeks considered [[geometry]] as just one of several [[science]]s, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's [[posterior analytics]] is a definitive exposition of the classical view.\n\nAn \"axiom\", in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that <blockquote>''When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.''</blockquote>\n\nAt the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a ''postulate''. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.<ref>Aristotle, Metaphysics Bk IV, Chapter 3, 1005b \"Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the first kind. \u2013 And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on which truth should be accepted, are due to want of training in logic; for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on it.\" W.D. Ross translation, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. Richard McKeon, (Random House, New York, 1941)|date=June 2011</ref>\n\nThe classical approach is well-illustrated by [[Euclid's Elements]], where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of \"common notions\" (very basic, self-evident assertions).\n\n:;Postulates\n:# It is possible to draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any other point.\n:# It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in both directions.\n:# It is possible to describe a [[circle]] with any center and any radius.\n:# It is true that all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.\n:# (\"[[Parallel postulate]]\") It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the [[polygon|interior angles]] on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] on that side on which are the [[angle]]s less than the two right angles.\n\n:;Common notions:\n:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.\n:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.\n:# The whole is greater than the part.\n\n===Modern development===\nA lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, [[propositional logic|propositions]], theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. [[Alessandro Padoa]], [[Mario Pieri]], and [[Giuseppe Peano]] were pioneers in this movement.\n\nStructuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], [[group (mathematics)|group theory]], [[topological space|topology]], [[linear space|vector spaces]]) without ''any'' particular application in mind. The distinction between an \"axiom\" and a \"postulate\" disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, [[hyperbolic geometry]] for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like \"line\" and \"parallel\" with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.\n\nWhen mathematicians employ the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.\n\nIt is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are \"propositions that are regarded as true without proof.\" Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.\n\nModern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of [[logic]]. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] are some of the key figures in this development.\n\nIn the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any [[Class (set theory)|collection]] of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be [[consistent]]; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.\n\nIt was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of [[Euclidean geometry]], and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.\n\nIn a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]]. Here the emergence of [[Russell's paradox]], and similar antinomies of [[na\u00efve set theory]] raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.\n\nThe formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 G\u00f6del showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ([[peano arithmetic|Peano's axioms]], for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a [[corollary]], G\u00f6del proved that the consistency of a theory like [[Peano arithmetic]] is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.\n\nIt is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of [[natural number]]s, an [[Infinite set|infinite]] but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] ([[Paul Cohen|Cohen]]) one can show that the [[continuum hypothesis]] (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.\n\n===Other sciences===\nAxioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in [[theoretical physics]]. In particular, the monumental work of [[Isaac Newton]] is essentially based on [[Euclid]]'s axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of [[spacetime]] and the physics taking place in it at any moment.\n\nIn 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]], and later on by those of [[general relativity]].\n\nAnother paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see [[EPR paradox]]), almost immediately contradicted by [[Niels Bohr]], concerned the interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be [[Probability theory|probabilistic]], whereas according to Einstein it should be [[deterministic]]. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of \"theorems\" derived by it, seemed to be identical.  Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics  \"hidden variables\" to enforce determinism. However,  thirty years later, in 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see [[Bell inequalities]]), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of [[Alain Aspect]] got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].)\n\nAs a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the \"reality\" and \"locality\" of experiments.\n\nRegardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither \"proves\" nor \"disproves\" an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a [[Falsifiability|falsified]] physical theory needs modification.\n\n==Mathematical logic==\nIn the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: ''logical'' and ''non-logical'' (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between \"axioms\" and \"postulates\" respectively).\n\n===Logical axioms===\nThese are certain [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] in a [[formal language]] that are [[tautology (logic)|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignment]] of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms ''at least'' some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in the language; in the case of [[predicate logic]] more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove [[logical truth]]s that are not tautologies in the strict sense.\n\n====Examples====\n\n=====Propositional logic=====\nIn [[propositional logic]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where <math>\\phi</math>, <math>\\chi</math>, and <math>\\psi</math> can be any formulae of the language and where the included [[Logical connective|primitive connectives]] are only \"<math>\\neg</math>\" for [[negation]] of the immediately following proposition and \"<math>\\to</math>\" for [[Entailment|implication]] from antecedent to consequent propositions:\n\n#<math>\\phi \\to (\\psi \\to \\phi)</math>\n#<math>(\\phi \\to (\\psi \\to \\chi)) \\to ((\\phi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\phi \\to \\chi))</math>\n#<math>(\\lnot \\phi \\to \\lnot \\psi) \\to (\\psi \\to \\phi).</math>\n\nEach of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math> are [[propositional variable]]s, then <math>A \\to (B \\to A)</math> and <math>(A \\to \\lnot B) \\to (C \\to (A \\to \\lnot B))</math> are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.\n\nOther axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.<ref>Mendelson, \"6. Other Axiomatizations\" of Ch. 1</ref>\n\nThese axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.<ref>Mendelson, \"3. First-Order Theories\" of Ch. 2</ref>\n\n=====First-order logic=====\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; \">\n'''Axiom of Equality.''' Let <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math> be a [[first-order language]]. For each variable <math>x</math>, the formula\n\n<center>\n<math>x = x</math>\n</center>\n\nis universally valid.\n</div>\n\nThis means that, for any [[Free variables and bound variables|variable symbol]] <math>x\\,,</math> the formula <math>x = x</math> can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of \"primitive notions\", either a precise notion of what we mean by <math>x = x</math>  (or, for that matter, \"to be equal\") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol <math>=</math>  has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.\n\nAnother, more interesting example [[axiom scheme]], is that which provides us with what is known as '''Universal Instantiation''':\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; \">\n'''Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.''' Given a formula <math>\\phi</math> in a first-order language <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math>, a variable <math>x</math> and a [[First order logic#Terms|term]] <math>t</math> that is [[First-order logic#Rules of inference|substitutable]] for <math>x</math> in <math>\\phi</math>, the formula\n\n<center>\n<math>\\forall x \\, \\phi \\to \\phi^x_t</math>\n</center>\n\nis universally valid.\n</div>\n\nWhere the symbol <math>\\phi^x_t</math> stands for the formula <math>\\phi</math> with the term <math>t</math> substituted for <math>x</math>. (See [[Substitution of variables]].) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property <math>P</math> holds for every <math>x</math> and that <math>t</math> stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim <math>P(t)</math>. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' <math>\\forall x \\phi \\to \\phi^x_t</math> ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a \"proof\" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''Existential Generalization''':\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; \">\n'''Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization.''' Given a formula <math>\\phi</math> in a first-order language <math>\\mathfrak{L}</math>, a variable <math>x</math> and a term <math>t</math> that is substitutable for <math>x</math> in <math>\\phi</math>, the formula\n\n<center>\n<math>\\phi^x_t \\to \\exists x \\, \\phi</math>\n</center>\n\nis universally valid.\n</div>\n\n===Non-logical axioms===\n'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''[[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.<ref>Mendelson, \"3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms\" of Ch. 2</ref>\n\nAlmost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.<!-- This turned out to be impossible{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]''); however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of [[neo-logicism]].-->\n\nNon-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical [[discourse]].  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some groups, the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.\n\nThus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a [[Formal system#Logical system|formal logic system]] that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''[[deductive system]]'''.\n\n====Examples====\nThis section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.\n\nBasic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]] are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of [[axiomatic set theory]] like [[Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory]], a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as [[Morse\u2013Kelley set theory]] or set theory with a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]] allowing the use of a [[Grothendieck universe]] are used, but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as [[second-order arithmetic]].{{citation needed|reason=This claim should include a citation |date=April 2016}}\n\nThe study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[Galois theory]].\n\nThis list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].\n\n=====Arithmetic=====\nThe [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[first-order arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed G\u00f6del to establish his famous [[G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].<ref>Mendelson, \"5. The Fixed Point Theorem. G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem\" of Ch. 2</ref>\n\nWe have a language <math>\\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \\{0, S\\}</math> where <math>0</math> is a constant symbol and <math>S</math> is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:\n\n# <math>\\forall x. \\lnot (Sx = 0) </math>\n# <math>\\forall x. \\forall y. (Sx = Sy \\to x = y) </math>\n# <math>(\\phi(0) \\land \\forall x.\\,(\\phi(x) \\to \\phi(Sx))) \\to \\forall x.\\phi(x)</math> for any <math>\\mathfrak{L}_{NT}</math> formula <math>\\phi</math> with one free variable.\n\nThe standard structure is <math>\\mathfrak{N} = \\langle\\N, 0, S\\rangle</math> where <math>\\N</math> is the set of natural numbers, <math>S</math> is the [[successor function]] and <math>0</math> is naturally interpreted as the number 0.\n\n=====Euclidean geometry=====\nProbably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]].  The axioms are referred to as \"4 + 1\" because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (\"through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel\") was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.  This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries. If one also removes the second postulate (\"a line can be extended indefinitely\") then [[elliptic geometry]] arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.\n\n=====Real analysis=====\nThe objectives of study are within the domain of [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''Dedekind complete ordered field'', meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===<span id=\"role\">Role in mathematical logic</span>===\n\n====Deductive systems and completeness====\nA '''[[deductive]] system''' consists of a set <math>\\Lambda</math> of logical axioms, a set <math>\\Sigma</math> of non-logical axioms, and a set <math>\\{(\\Gamma, \\phi)\\}</math> of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas <math>\\phi</math>,\n<center>\n<math>\\text{if }\\Sigma \\models \\phi\\text{ then }\\Sigma \\vdash \\phi</math>\n</center>\n\nthat is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of <math>\\Sigma</math> there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from <math>\\Sigma</math>.  This is sometimes expressed as \"everything that is true is provable\", but it must be understood that \"true\" here means \"made true by the set of axioms\", and not, for example, \"true in the intended interpretation\". [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.\n\nNote that \"completeness\" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms <math>\\Sigma</math> of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement <math>\\phi</math> such that neither <math>\\phi</math> nor <math>\\lnot\\phi</math> can be proved from the given set of axioms.\n\nThere is thus, on the one hand, the notion of ''completeness of a deductive system'' and on the other hand that of ''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.\n\n===Further discussion===\nEarly [[mathematician]]s regarded [[Foundations of geometry|axiomatic geometry]] as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Logic}}\n*  [[Axiomatic system]]\n*  [[Dogma]]\n*  [[List of axioms]]\n*  [[Model theory]]\n*  [[Regul\u00e6 Juris]]\n*  [[Theorem]]\n*  [[Presupposition]]\n*  [[Physical law]]\n*  [[Axioms (journal)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mendelson, Elliot (1987).

Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, has to say for [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]]\u2014which, unlike [[Hesiod]],<ref>Hesiod, in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (see on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project]), advises the early Greek farmers, \"First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough.\"</ref> the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. \"Nothing at all,\" Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is \"alpha\", because it is very plain and simple\u2014the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue\u2014and therefore this is the first sound that children make.\n\nAccording to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]].\n\n===Alpha and Omega===\n[[Image:Memorial Stained Glass, Yeo Hall, Chapel, Royal Military College of Canada 605 Oliver Tiffany & 203 Williiam Bermingham.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Memorial Stained Glass window, [[Royal Military College of Canada]] features [[Alpha and Omega]]]]\nAlpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something.

In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed \"[[information overload]].\" In 1970 his first major book about the future, ''[[Future Shock]]'', became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies.\n\nHe and his wife Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him for most of his writings, moved on to examining the reaction to [[Social change|changes in society]] with another best-selling book, ''The Third Wave'' in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication.

The \"Second Wave,\" he labels society during the [[Industrial Revolution]] (ca. late 17th century through the mid-20th century). That period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional [[nuclear family]], and initiated a factory-like education system, and the growth of the corporation.

Being in the [[Earth 616|mainstream continuity]] of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously, with a brief interruption in 1995, until its relaunch with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. [[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|A video game based on the comic book series]] was first released 2000 and [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|a film named after the comic book series]] was released July 3, 2012.\n\nAfter [[DC Comics]]' [[The New 52|relaunch]] of ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' with new #1 issues in 2011, it had been the highest-numbered American comic still in circulation until it was cancelled. The title ended its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with [[Dying Wish|issue #700]] in December 2012. It was replaced by ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.<ref name=\"SuperiorSM\">{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/news/story/19523/marvel_now_qa_superior_spider-man#ixzz28x0lcuK0|title= Marvel NOW!

In late 2015, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was relaunched again with a new volume with issue #1 following the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]],<ref name=\"DeFalco87\">{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 87|isbn =978-0756641238|quote=  Deciding that his new character would have spider-like powers, [Stan] Lee commissioned Jack Kirby to work on the first story.

Lee turned to Steve Ditko, the regular artist on ''Amazing Adult Fantasy'', who designed a skinny, awkward teenager with glasses.}}</ref> and the pair produced 38 issues from March 1963 to July 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.\n\n''The Amazing Spider-Man'' has been the character's [[Canon (fiction)|flagship series]] for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until ''[[Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976, although 1972 saw the debut of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in ''Amazing'', and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character's history have occurred.

''Amazing Spider-Man'' began as a bimonthly title, but was quickly promoted to a monthly.\"</ref> The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager [[Peter Parker]]. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance [[photographer]] for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]].\n\nBy focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]],<ref name=\"DeFalco87\" /> and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.\n\nMost of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time.

Romita's Spider-Man \u2013 more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko's \u2013 became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] in #52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in #56 (Jan. 1968).

A succession of artists, including [[Ron Garney]], [[Steve Skroce]], [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]], [[Rafael Kayanan]] and John Byrne penciled the book until the final issue, #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).\n\n===Relaunch and the 2000s===\nMarvel began ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).<ref name=\"Marvel 500s\">{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17588|publisher= Comic Book Resources|title= The Marvel 500s: How Many Are There?|first= James|last= Hunt|date= August 5, 2008|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6FrovtrC4?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17588|archivedate= April 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 14, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Cowsill \"1990s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 246: \"This new series heralded a fresh start for the web-slinger's adventures.\"</ref> [[Howard Mackie]] wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|new Spider-Woman]] (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne's]] ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]'', which launched at the same time as the reboot. Byrne also penciled issues #1\u201318 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13\u201314, [[John Romita Jr.]] took his place soon after in October 2000. Mackie's run ended with ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001'', which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.\n\nWith #30 (June 2001), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over as writer<ref>Cowsill \"2000s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 262: \"J. Michael Straczynski and artist John Romita Jr. took the helm in this issue to create some of the best Spider-Man stories of the decade.\"</ref> and oversaw additional storylines &mdash; most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man's powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider's bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski, J. Michael]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Interlude|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|volume= 2|issue= 37|date= January 2002}}</ref> and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.\n\nIssue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003).<ref name=\"Marvel 500s\"/> [[Mike Deodato|Mike Deodato, Jr.]] penciled the series from mid-2004 until 2006.\n\nThat year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\",<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Straczynski, J.

This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\", written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24 (Nov. 2007) and ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker's dying [[Aunt May]] if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski's tenure as writer.\n\nFollowing this, Marvel made ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' the company's sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with [[domino effect]] differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man's secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). The alternating regular writers were initially [[Dan Slott]], [[Bob Gale]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Fred Van Lente]], and [[Zeb Wells]], joined by a rotation of artists that included [[Chris Bachalo]], [[Phil Jimenez]], [[Mike McKone]], [[John Romita Jr.]] and [[Marcos Mart\u00edn]].

Bird International Airport|Antigua airport]]), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]], part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], roughly at [[17th parallel north|17\u00b0N]] of the [[equator]]. The country's name was given by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 after discovering the island, in honor of the Virgin of La Antigua in the [[Seville Cathedral]]. The country is nicknamed \"Land of 365 Beaches\" due to the many beaches surrounding the islands. Its governance, language, and culture have all been strongly influenced by the [[British Empire]], of which the [[sovereign state]] was formerly a part, gaining sovereignty on 1 November 1981. It remains a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the head of state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/antigua-barbuda|title=Antigua and Barbuda - Countries - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''{{lang|es|Antigua}}'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"ancient\" and ''{{lang|es|barbuda}}'' is Spanish for \"bearded\". The island of Antigua was originally called ''{{lang|tnq|Wadadli}}'' by [[Arawak]]s and is locally known by that name today; [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] possibly called it ''{{lang|crb|Wa'omoni}}''. [[Christopher Columbus]], while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish [[Seville Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}<!--6 paragraphs have no citations-->\n{{Main|History of Antigua and Barbuda}}\n\nAntigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer [[Amerindian]]s called the [[Ciboney]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction ::Antigua and Barbuda|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html}}</ref> [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]].\n\nThe [[Arawaks]] introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (Moris cultivar of ''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chiles]], [[guava]], [[tobacco]], and [[cotton]].\n\nThe indigenous West Indians made excellent seagoing vessels which they used to sail around on the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonize much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.\n\nMost Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 AD; those who remained were later raided by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly [[cannibalism|cannibalising]] others.\n[[File:The Mill Yard - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate V - BL.jpg|thumb|left|Antigua in 1823]]\n\nThe ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' makes it clear that the European invaders had difficulty differentiating between the various groups of the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article.\n\nEuropean and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean's native population. [[Smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.<ref>{{cite book| last = Austin Alchon| first = Suzanne| title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA62| year = 2003| publisher = University of New Mexico Press| isbn = 0-8263-2871-7| pages = 62\u201363 }}\n</ref> Some historians{{Who|date=March 2011}} believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of deaths amongst enslaved natives.

The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1684. [[Slavery]], established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief [[France|French]] interlude in 1666.\n\nThe islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 1 November 1981, with [[Elizabeth II]] as the first [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]]. [[Vere Cornwall Bird Sr]] became the first Prime Minister.\n\nMost of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph).

The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black & Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.\n\nAn increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), United States and [[Canada]]. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasing, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=23 August 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814213848/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm|archivedate= 14 August 2007 |deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\nEnglish is the official language. The [[Barbuda]]n accent is slightly different from the [[Antigua]]n.\n\nIn the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.\n\nMany of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: \"Ent it?\" meaning \"Ain't it?\" which is itself dialectal and means \"Isn't it?\". Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa.\n\nSpanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html Bernadette Farquhar \u2013 The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's]]]]\n\nA majority of 77%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html|title=Antigua and Barbuda |publisher=CIA, 2011 }}</ref> of Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglicans]] (17,6%) being the largest single denomination.

A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]], currently [[Gaston Browne]] (2014\u2013). The Prime Minister is the [[Head of Government]].\n\n[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the [[Official Opposition|opposition]] party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by [[first past the post]]) to serve five-year terms.\n\nThe current Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable [[Baldwin Spencer]].\n\n===Elections===\n[[File:Antigua.St.John.from west.wmt.jpg|thumb|St. John's parish on Antigua.]]\n\nThe last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the [[Antigua Labour Party]] won 14 seats, and the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] 3 seats.\n\nSince 1949, elections have been won by the [[populism|populist]] Antigua Labour Party. However, in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004]] saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]], who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976.\n\nThe elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971\u20131976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.\n\n====Party elections====\n[[Gaston Browne]] defeated his predecessor [[Lester Bryant Bird]] at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda.\n\n=== Judiciary ===\nThe Judicial branch is the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). Antigua is also a member of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].

Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.\n\nInvestment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] has accused the Antigua-based [[Stanford International Bank]], owned by Texas billionaire [[Allen Stanford]], of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21stanford.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm |first1=Clifford |last1=Krauss |first2=Julie |last2=Creswell |first3=Charlie |last3=Savage |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> (check status 20100312)\n\nThe twin-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labor (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.\n\n[[Manufacturing]] is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], from which about one-third of all tourists come.\n\nFollowing the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda also utilizes an [[economic citizenship]] program to spur investment into the country.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Antigua and Barbuda}}\nAntigua & Barbuda has a greater than 90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda built the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the Mt. St. John Medical Centre.

The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care.\n\nThere is also a government owned state college in Antigua as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT) and the Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute (ABHTI). The [[University of the West Indies]] has a branch in Antigua for local students to continue university studies.\n\nAntigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Music of Antigua and Barbuda}}\n\nThe culture is predominantly a mixture of West African and British cultural influences.\n\nCricket is the national sport. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing. ([[Antigua Sailing Week]] attracts locals and visitors from all over the world).\n\n[[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[soca music]], both originating primarily out of [[Trinidad]], are important in Antigua and Barbuda.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/antigua-barbuda/agcarn01.htm|title=Antigua & Barbuda \u2013 Carnival & Music|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\nThe national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the [[British West Indies]], although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Further|Antigua and Barbuda cuisine}}\n\nCorn and sweet potatoes play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|u\u02d0|k|u\u02d0|n|\u0251\u02d0}} is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, fungi {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|u\u02d0|n|d\u0292|i\u02d0}}, is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.\n\n===Media===\nThere are two daily newspapers: the \"Daily Observer\" and \"Caribbean Times\". The local channel ABS TV 10 is available (it is the only station which shows exclusively local programs). There are also several local and regional radio stations, such as V2C-AM 620, ZDK-AM 1100, VYBZ-FM 92.9, ZDK-FM 97.1, Observer Radio 91.1 FM, DNECA Radio 90.1 FM, Second Advent Radio 101.5 FM, Abundant Life Radio 103.9 FM, Crusader Radio 107.3 FM, Nice FM 104.3\n\n===Literature===\nAntiguan author [[Jamaica Kincaid]] has published over 20 works of literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-24|title=Jamaica Kincaid|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jamaica_Kincaid&oldid=806781179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}\n\n[[File:Cricket ground.jpg|thumb|The [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].]]\nThe [[Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team]] represented the country at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the [[Leeward Islands cricket team]] in domestic matches and the [[West Indies cricket team]] internationally. The [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in the West Indies from 11 March to 28 April 2007.\n\nAntigua hosted eight matches at the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], which was completed on 11 February 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people.\nAntigua is a Host of [[Stanford Twenty20]] \u2013 [[Twenty20 Cricket]], a version started by [[Allen Stanford]] in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part. \n[[Rugby football|Rugby]] and [[netball]] are popular as well.\n\n[[Association football]], or soccer, is also a very popular sport. Antigua has a [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|national football team]] which entered [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualification]] for the 1974 tournament and for 1986 and onwards. A professional team was formed in 2011, [[Antigua Barracuda FC]], which played in the [[USL Pro]], a lower professional league in the USA. The nation's team had a major achievement in 2012, getting out of its preliminary group for the 2014 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], notably due to a victory over powerful [[Haiti]]. In its first game in the next [[CONCACAF]] group play on 8 June 2012 in [[Tampa]], FL, Antigua and Barbuda, comprising 17 Barracuda players and 7 from the lower English professional leagues, scored a goal against the United States. However, the team lost 3:1 to the US.\n\n==Notables==\n<!---athletes need to either be professional or win a medal in the Olympics to be notable-->\n<!---need footnote to tie article to

after the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415 which took place there.\n\n==Geography==\nSituated {{convert|12|mi|0|abbr=off}} north-west of [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] on the D71 road between [[Hesdin]] and [[Fruges]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe toponym is attested as ''Aisincurt'' in 1175, derived from a Germanic masculine name Aizo, Aizino and the early Northern French word ''curt'' 'farm with a courtyard' (Late Latin ''cortem''). It has no etymological connection in French with [[Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] (attested as ''Egincourt'' 875), which is derived from another Germanic male name ''*Ingin-''.<ref>[[Albert Dauzat]] and [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de lieux en France'', \u00e9ditions Larousse 1968. p. 4.</ref>\nThe battle was named after a nearby castle  called Azincourt. The modern settlement has in turn been named after the battle in the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==History==\nAzincourt is famous as being near the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King [[Henry V of England]] defeated the forces led by [[Charles d'Albret]] on behalf of [[Charles VI of France]], which has gone down in history as the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle.<ref>The House of Commons: 1509 \u2013 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T.

Scarisbrick, p. 23</ref> so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII crossed the English Channel, stopping by at Azincourt.\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|800px|The battlefield today|left}}\n\nThe battle, as was the tradition, was named after a nearby castle called Azincourt.

Speer was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As \"the Nazi who said sorry\",{{efn|name=The Nazi Who Said Sorry}} he accepted moral responsibility at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and in his memoirs for complicity in crimes of the Nazi regime, while insisting he had been ignorant of [[the Holocaust]].\n\nSpeer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931, launching himself on a political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the ''[[Nazi party rally grounds|Zeppelinfeld]]'' stadium in [[Nuremberg]] where Party [[Nuremberg Rally|rallies]] were held. Speer also made plans to [[Welthauptstadt Germania|reconstruct Berlin]] on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system. In February 1942, Hitler appointed him as Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production.\n\nAfter the war, he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor]]. Despite repeated attempts to gain early release, he served his full sentence, most of it at [[Spandau Prison]] in [[West Berlin]]. Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]'', detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He wrote a third book, ''Infiltration'', about the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Speer died of a [[stroke]] in 1981 while on a visit to London.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Early years ==\nSpeer was born in [[Mannheim]], into an upper-middle-class family. He was the second of three sons of Luise M\u00e1thilde Wilhelmine (Hommel) and [[Albert Friedrich Speer]].{{sfn|Schubert|2006|p=5}} In 1918, the family moved permanently to their summer home Villa Speer on Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg, [[Heidelberg]].{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=7}} According to [[Henry T. King]], deputy prosecutor at [[Nuremberg]] who later wrote a book about Speer, \"Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth.\"{{sfn|King|1997|p=27}} Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering. Speer's Heidelberg school offered [[rugby union|rugby football]], unusual for Germany, and Speer was a participant.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=23}} He wanted to become a [[mathematician]], but his father said if Speer chose this occupation he would \"lead a life without money, without a position and without a future\".{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=28}} Instead, Speer followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nSpeer began his architectural studies at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income.{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=9}} In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the \"much more reputable\" [[Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen|Technical University of Munich]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=63}} In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technical University of Berlin]] where he studied under [[Heinrich Tessenow]], whom Speer greatly admired.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=10\u201311}} After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor for a man of 22.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=34\u201336}} As such, Speer taught some of Tessenow's classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=71\u201373}} In Munich, and continuing in Berlin, Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with [[Rudolf Wolters]], who also studied under Tessenow.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nIn mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905\u20131987), the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt that the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n== Nazi architect ==\n\n=== Joining the Nazis (1930\u20131934) ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V00555-3, Obersalzberg, Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Speer shows a project to Hitler at [[Obersalzberg]]]]\n\nSpeer stated he was apolitical when he was a young man, and he attended a Berlin Nazi rally in December&nbsp;1930 only at the urging of some of his students.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=79}} On March 1, 1931, he applied to join the Nazi Party and became member number 474,481.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=29}}\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\nIn 1931, Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow's assistant and moved to Mannheim. His father gave him a job as manager of the elder Speer's properties. In July&nbsp;1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' [[Weimar republic#Elections of July 1932|elections]]. While they were there, his friend, Nazi Party official [[Karl Hanke]], recommended the young architect to [[Joseph Goebbels]] to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. Speer agreed to do the work. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler [[Machtergreifung|took office]] in January&nbsp;1933.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nThe organizers of the 1933 [[Nuremberg Rally]] asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor [[Rudolf Hess]] were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler's Munich apartment to seek his approval.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=100\u201301}} This work won Speer his first national post, as Nazi Party \"Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations\".{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=49}}\n\nShortly after Hitler had come into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he contracted [[Paul Troost]] to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=41}} As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=101\u201303}} Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=106}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThe two men found much in common: Hitler spoke of Speer as a \"kindred spirit\" for whom he had always maintained \"the warmest human feelings\".{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=42}} The young, ambitious architect was dazzled by his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler, which guaranteed him a flood of commissions from the government and from the highest ranks of the Party.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=54}} Speer testified at Nuremberg, \"I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff.

Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess's staff.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=60}}\n\nOne of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium\u2014the [[N\u00fcrnberg]] [[Nazi party rally grounds|parade grounds]] seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. This huge work was able to hold 340,000 people.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=59}} Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, many of whom were overweight.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=131}} Speer surrounded the site with 130 [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight]]s.

Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of Nazi Germany, just as [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of those civilizations.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-016-31, Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler, Architekt Ruff.jpg|thumb|left|Adolf Hitler looks over the designs for [[Nuremberg]]]]\n\nWhen Hitler deprecated [[Werner March]]'s design for the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)#1936: Reichssportfeld|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] as too [[Modern architecture|modern]], Speer modified the plans by adding a stone exterior.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=65}} Speer designed the German Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. The German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pavilion sites were opposite each other. On learning (through a clandestine look at the Soviet plans) that the Soviet design included [[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman|two colossal figures]] seemingly about to overrun the German site, Speer modified his design to include a cubic mass which would check their advance, with a huge eagle on top looking down on the Soviet figures.{{sfn|Paris World Exposition 1937}} Speer received, from [[Hitler Youth]] leader and later fellow Spandau prisoner [[Baldur von Schirach]], the Golden Hitler Youth Honor Badge with oak leaves.{{sfn|Angolia|1978|p=194}}\n\nIn 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as [[:de:Generalbauinspektor|General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital]] with the rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government. The position carried with it extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government and made Speer answerable to Hitler alone.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=64}} It also made Speer a member of the ''Reichstag'', though the body by then [[Enabling Act of 1933|had little effective power]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=144}} Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to [[Welthauptstadt Germania|rebuild Berlin]]. The plans centered on a three-mile long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the ''Prachtstrasse'', or Street of Magnificence;{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=140}} he also referred to it as the \"North-South Axis\".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=141}} At the northern end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'', a huge assembly hall with a dome which would have been over {{convert|700|ft|m|-1}} high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue a great triumphal arch would rise; it would be almost {{convert|400|ft|m|-1}} high, and able to fit the [[Arc de Triomphe]] inside its opening. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=71}} Part of the land for the boulevard was to be obtained by consolidating Berlin's railway system.{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=77}} Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the ''Prachtstrasse''.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=27}} When Speer's father saw the model for the new Berlin, he said to his son, \"You've all gone completely insane.\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=158}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K1216-501, Berlin, Neue Reichskanzlei, Marmorgalerie.jpg|thumb|Marble Gallery of the [[New Reich Chancellery]]]]\n\nAll the while plans to build a new Reich chancellery had been underway since 1934. Land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March&nbsp;1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at [[Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46\u201347}} Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. He had been commissioned to renovate the [[Borsig Palace]] on the corner of Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and [[Wilhelmstra\u00dfe]] as a headquarter for the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], who were about to be relocated from Munich to Berlin in the aftermath of the [[Night of the Long Knives|R\u00f6hm purge]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=45}} and completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by May&nbsp;1936. In June 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30,000 Reichsmark and estimated that the chancellery would be completed within three to four years. Detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1938. On 27&nbsp;January&nbsp;1938 Speer received plenipotentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancellery by 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1939. Yet for propagandistic reasons, to prove the vigor and organizational skills of National Socialism, Hitler claimed during the topping-out ceremony on 2&nbsp;August&nbsp;1938 that he had ordered Speer to build the new chancellery just that year. Speer reiterated this claim in his memoirs to show that he had been up to that supposed challenge,{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46\u201349}} and some of his biographers, most notably Joachim Fest, have followed that account.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=101\u201306}} The building itself, hailed by Hitler as the \"crowning glory of the greater German political empire\", was designed as a theatrical set for representation, \"to intimidate and humiliate\", as historian [[Martin Kitchen]] puts it. Because of shortages of labor, the construction workers had to work in two ten- to twelve-hour shifts to have the chancellery completed by early January 1939.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53\u201356}}\n\nDuring the war the chancellery was destroyed, except for the exterior walls, by air raids and in the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945. It was eventually dismantled by the Soviets. Rumor has it that the remains have been used for other building projects like the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], [[Mohrenstra\u00dfe (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mohrenstra\u00dfe metro station]] or Soviet war memorials in Berlin, but none of these are true.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=56}}\n\nDuring the Chancellery project, the [[pogrom]] of [[Kristallnacht]] took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of ''Inside the Third Reich'', and it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=164}}\n\nSpeer was under significant psychological pressure during this period of his life. He later remembered:\n\n{{quote\n| Soon after Hitler had given me the first large architectural commissions, I began to suffer from anxiety in long tunnels, in airplanes, or in small rooms.

That was the whole point of my buildings. They would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany. All I ''wanted'' was for this great man to dominate the globe.\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=186}}\n\nSpeer placed his department at the disposal of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=111\u201312}} Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=115}} As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and N\u00fcrnberg plans.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=176\u201378}}{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=180\u201381}} Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the ''Wehrmacht'' and ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=182}}\n\nIn 1940, [[Joseph Stalin]] proposed that Speer pay a visit to Moscow. Stalin had been particularly impressed by Speer's work in Paris, and wished to meet the \"Architect of the Reich\". Hitler, alternating between amusement and anger, did not allow Speer to go, fearing that Stalin would put Speer in a \"rat hole\" until a new Moscow arose.{{sfn|Fest|2007|pp=66\u201367}} When [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Speer came to doubt, despite Hitler's reassurances, that his projects for Berlin would ever be completed.{{sfn|Fest|2007|p=69}}\n\n== Minister of Armaments ==\n\n=== Appointment and increasing power ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0103-502, Albert Speer bei Panzer-Besichtigung.jpg|upright|thumb|Speer inspects a [[Panther tank]], 1944.]]\n<!---[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-026-22, Adolf Hitler verleiht Albert Speer Fritz-Todt-Ring.jpg|upright|thumb|Speer (''right'') awarded an [[Organisation Todt]] ring by Hitler \u2013 May 1943]]--->\nOn February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's [[Wolf's Lair|eastern headquarters]] at [[K\u0119trzyn|Rastenburg]]. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had cancelled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented G\u00f6ring with the ''[[fait accompli]]'' of Speer's appointment.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=193\u201396}}\n\nAt the time of Speer's accession to the office, the German economy, unlike the British one, was not fully geared for war production. Consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime. No fewer than five \"Supreme Authorities\" had jurisdiction over armament production\u2014one of which, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production. Few women were employed in the factories, which were running only one shift. One evening soon after his appointment, Speer went to visit a Berlin armament factory; he found no one on the premises.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=139\u201341}}\n\nSpeer overcame these difficulties by centralizing power over the war economy in himself. Factories were given autonomy, or as Speer put it, \"self-responsibility\", and each factory concentrated on a single product.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=295}} Backed by Hitler's strong support (the dictator stated, \"Speer, I'll sign anything that comes from you\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=143}}), he divided the armament field according to weapon system, with experts rather than civil servants overseeing each department. No department head could be older than 55\u2014anyone older being susceptible to \"routine and arrogance\"{{sfn|Fest|2007|p=76}}\u2014and no deputy older than 40. Over these departments was a central planning committee headed by Speer, which took increasing responsibility for war production, and as time went by, for the German economy itself. According to the minutes of a conference at ''Wehrmacht'' High Command in March&nbsp;1942, \"It is only Speer's word that counts nowadays. He can interfere in all departments. Already he overrides all departments&nbsp;... On the whole, Speer's attitude is to the point.\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=142\u201344}} Goebbels would note in his diary in June 1943, \"Speer is still tops with the ''F\u00fchrer''. He is truly a genius with organization.\"{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=75}} Speer was so successful in his position that by late 1943, he was widely regarded among the Nazi elite as a possible successor to Hitler.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=376\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J15733, Waffenvorf\u00fchrung, E. Milch, A. Speer.jpg|thumb|Speer (right, with [[swastika]] armband) looks on with Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] (left) during weapons testing.]]\nWhile Speer had tremendous power, he was of course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'' (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German and slave labor, Hitler, under the influence of [[Martin Bormann]], instead appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]]. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations&nbsp;\u2013 and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the most brutal methods.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=146\u201350}}\n\nOn December&nbsp;10, 1943, Speer visited the underground [[Mittelwerk]] [[V-2 rocket]] factory that used [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] labor.

However, the Allies in their [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] did not concentrate on industry, and Speer was able to overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of [[German tanks in World War II|tanks]] more than doubled in 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''{{'s}} [[Uboat|submarines]] was reduced from one year to two months.

According to Speer's post-war memoirs, his political rivals (mainly G\u00f6ring and [[Martin Bormann]]), attempted to have some of his powers permanently transferred to them during his absence. Speer claimed that SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] tried to have him physically isolated by having Himmler's personal physician [[Karl Gebhardt]] treat him, though his \"care\" did not improve his health. Speer's case was transferred to his friend Dr. [[Karl Brandt]], and he slowly recovered.{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=330\u201313}}\n\n[[File:Weingut I 1945 internal view.jpg|thumb|Internal view of the planned underground factory, [[Weingut I]], one of J\u00e4gerstab's projects, as found by the [[U.S. Army]] in 1945.]]\nIn response to the Allied air raids on aircraft factories, [[Adolf Hitler]] authorised the creation of a [[J\u00e4gerstab]], a governmental task force composed of [[Reich Aviation Ministry]], Armaments Ministry and [[SS]] personnel. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the 1 March 1944 order of Speer, with support from [[Erhard Milch]] of the Reich Aviation Ministry. Speer and Milch played a key role in directing the activities of the agency, while the day-to-day operations were handled by Chief of Staff [[Karl Saur]], the head of the Technical Office in the Armaments Ministry.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=347|2006}} Production continued to improve until late 1944, with allied bombing destroying just 9% of German production. Production of German fighter aircraft was more than doubled from 1943 to 1944.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}}\n\nIn April, Speer's rivals for power succeeded in having him deprived of responsibility for construction. Speer sent Hitler a bitter letter, concluding with an offer of his resignation. Judging Speer indispensable to the war effort, Field Marshal [[Erhard Milch]] persuaded Hitler to try to get his minister to reconsider. Hitler sent Milch to Speer with a message not addressing the dispute but instead stating that he still regarded Speer as highly as ever. According to Milch, upon hearing the message, Speer burst out, \"The ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' can kiss my ass!\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=210}} After a lengthy argument, Milch persuaded Speer to withdraw his offer of resignation, on the condition his powers were restored.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=207\u201312}} On April&nbsp;23, 1944, Speer went to see Hitler who agreed that \"everything [will] stay as it was, [Speer will] remain the head of all German construction\".{{sfn|Speer|1981|pp=232\u201333}} According to Speer, while he was successful in this debate, Hitler had also won, \"because he wanted and needed me back in his corner, and he got me\".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=429}}\n\nThe J\u00e4gerstab was given extraordinary powers over labour, production and transportation resources, with its functions taking priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians or restoration of vital city services. The factories that came under the J\u00e4gerstab program saw their work-weeks extended to 72 hours. At the same time, Milch took steps to rationalise production by reducing the number of variants of each type of aircraft produced.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=348|2006}}\n\n[[File:Weingut I bogen.JPG|thumb|The last remaining arch of [[Weingut I]], one of seven that were completed out of a planned twelve.]]\nThe J\u00e4gerstab was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labour]] for the benefit of Germany's war industry and its air force, the [[Luftwaffe]]. The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation manufacturing.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=45|2014}} Records show that SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of J\u00e4gerstab's construction activities. Taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects, the historian Marc Buggeln estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000\u221290,000 inmates. They belonged to the various sub-camps of [[Mittelbau-Dora]], [[Mauthausen-Gusen]], [[Buchenwald]] and other camps. The prisoners worked for [[Junkers]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]] and [[BMW]], among others.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=46\u201348|2014}}\n\nThe cooperation between the Reich Ministry of Aviation, the Ministry of Armaments and the SS proved especially productive. Although intended to function for only six months, already in late May Speer and Milch discussed with Goring the possibility of centralising all of Germany's arms manufacturing under a similar task force. On 1 August 1944, Speer reorganised the J\u00e4gerstab into the [[R\u00fcstungsstab]] (Armament Staff) to apply the same model of operation to all top-priority armament programs.{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=82}}\n\nThe formation of the R\u00fcstungsstab allowed Speer, for the first time, to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the [[Wehrmacht]] under the authority of his ministry, further marginalising the [[Reich Ministry of Aviation]]. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force.{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=83}} The task force oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the [[He 162]], the ''Volksj\u00e4ger'' (\"people's fighter\"), as part of the [[Emergency Fighter Program]].{{sfn|Uziel|2012|pp=83, 240}}\n\nThe R\u00fcstungsstab assumed responsibilities for the underground transfer projects of the J\u00e4gerstab. In November 1944, 1.8 million square meters of underground space were ready for occupancy, encompassing over 1,000 spaces commissioned by the task force. But by this time German production was beginning to collapse.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}} (Post-war, Speer sought to downplay his involvement with these projects and claimed that only 300,000 square meters had been completed). According to Buggeln, the R\u00fcstungsstab played a key role in maintaining and increasing production of fighter aircraft and [[V-2 rocket]]s.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=43|2014}}\n\n=== Defeat of Nazi Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1206-511, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Reichsminister'' Speer]]\nSpeer's name was included on the list of members of a post-Hitler government drawn up by the conspirators behind the [[July 20 plot|July&nbsp;1944 assassination plot]] to kill Hitler.

Without them, Speer wrote, Germany's coal production would only be a quarter of its 1944 total\u2014not nearly enough to continue the war. He told Hitler in no uncertain terms that without Silesia, \"the war is lost.\" Hitler merely filed the memo in his safe.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1096\u201397}}\n\nBy February&nbsp;1945, Speer was working to supply areas about to be occupied with food and materials to get them through the hard times ahead.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=482}} On March 19, 1945, Hitler issued his [[Nero Decree]], ordering a [[scorched earth]] policy in both Germany and the occupied territories.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=250\u201351}} The plan included forcing millions of people on a long trek without food or supplies which would have resulted in a \"hunger catastrophe\" according to Speer; Hitler had no compunction about this, believing that only the \"inferior ones\" would have survived the battles.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1104}}\n\nHitler's order, by its terms, deprived Speer of any power to interfere with the decree, and Speer went to confront Hitler, reiterating that the war was lost.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=486\u201392}} Hitler gave Speer 24 hours to reconsider his position, and when the two met the following day, Speer answered, \"I stand unconditionally behind you.\"{{sfn|Speer|1976|pp=4\u20136}} However, he demanded the exclusive power to implement the Nero Decree, and Hitler signed an order to that effect. Using this order, Speer worked to persuade generals and ''Gauleiters'' to circumvent the Nero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=498\u2013504}} Shirer describes this as a \"superhuman effort\" by Speer and a number of army officials, acting contrary to Hitler's orders,\nto save vital communications, plants and stores.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1104\u20131105}}\n\nSpeer managed to reach a relatively safe area near [[Hamburg]] as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263\u201370}} Speer stated at Nuremberg, \"I felt that it was my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again.\"{{sfn|Speer cross-examination}} Speer visited the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' on April&nbsp;22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263\u201370}} Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, \"Psychologically, it is possible that this is the way he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself.\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=529}} Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=528\u201331}}\n\nThe following morning, Speer left the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''; Hitler curtly bade him farewell. Speer toured the damaged Chancellery one last time before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263\u201370}} On April&nbsp;29, the day before committing suicide, Hitler dictated a [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]] which dropped Speer from the successor government.

On May&nbsp;23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=273\u201381}}\n\nSpeer was taken to several internment centres for Nazi officials and interrogated.

He wrote, \"I am obsessed with the idea of using this time of confinement for writing a book of major importance&nbsp;... That could mean transforming prison cell into scholar's den.\"{{sfn|Speer|1976|p=75}} The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs, and mail was severely limited and censored. However, Speer was able to have his writings sent to Wolters as a result of an offer from a sympathetic orderly, and they eventually amounted to 20,000 sheets. He had completed his memoirs by 1954, which became the basis of ''Inside the Third Reich'' and which Wolters arranged to have transcribed onto 1,100 typewritten pages.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=316}} He was also able to send letters and financial instructions and to obtain writing paper and letters from the outside.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=310\u201311}} His many letters to his children were secretly transmitted and eventually formed the basis for ''Spandau: The Secret Diaries''.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=672}}\n[[File:Albert Speer in jail cell Nuremberg Germany 1945.jpeg|thumb|left|Albert Speer in his jail cell, Nuremberg, 1945]]\nWith the draft memoir complete and clandestinely transmitted, Speer sought a new project. He found one while taking his daily exercise, walking in circles around the prison yard. Measuring the path's distance carefully, he set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heidelberg. He then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey, visualizing the places that he was \"traveling\" through while walking the path around the prison yard. He ordered guidebooks and other materials about the nations through which he imagined that he was passing so as to envision as accurate a picture as possible.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=316\u201317}} He meticulously calculated every meter traveled and mapped distances to the real-world geography. He began in northern Germany, passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia, then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence {{convert|35|km}} south of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], Mexico.{{sfn|Speer|1976|p=447}}\n\nSpeer devoted much of his time and energy to reading. The prisoners brought some books with them in their personal property, but Spandau Prison had no library; books were sent from Spandau's municipal library.{{sfn|Speer|1976|p=69}} From 1952, the prisoners were also able to order books from the Berlin central library in [[Wilmersdorf]].{{sfn|Speer|1976|p=195}} Speer was a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years at Spandau alone.{{sfn|Fishman|1986|p=129}} He read classic novels, travelogues, books on [[ancient Egypt]], and biographies of such figures as [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], and [[Genghis Khan]].{{sfn|Speer|1976|p=195}} He took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work, at first to do something constructive while afflicted with writer's block.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=312}} He was allowed to build an ambitious garden, transforming what he initially described as a \"wilderness\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=605}} into what the American commander at Spandau described as \"Speer's [[Garden of Eden]]\".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=654}}\n\nSpeer's supporters maintained a continual call for his release.

His books provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era, most notably ''Inside the Third Reich'' (in German, ''Erinnerungen'', or ''Reminiscences''{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=5}}) and ''Spandau: The Secret Diaries'', and they have become much valued by historians. Speer was aided in shaping the works by [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Wolf Jobst Siedler]] from the publishing house Ullstein.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=329\u201330}} He found himself unable to re-establish his relationship with his children, even with his son [[Albert Speer (born 1934)|Albert]] who had also become an architect. According to Speer's daughter [[Hilde Schramm|Hilde]], \"One by one my sister and brothers gave up. There was no communication.\"{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=664\u201365}}\n\nFollowing the publication of his bestselling books, Speer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80 percent of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection and for fear of being called a hypocrite.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=348}}\n\nWolters strongly objected to Speer referring to Hitler in the memoirs as a criminal, and Speer predicted as early as 1953 that he would lose a \"good many friends\" if the writings were published.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=316}} This came to pass following the publication of ''Inside the Third Reich'', as close friends distanced themselves from him, such as Wolters and sculptor [[Arno Breker]]. Hitler's personal pilot [[Hans Baur]] suggested that \"Speer must have taken leave of his senses.\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=345\u201346}} Wolters wondered that Speer did not now \"walk through life in a [[hair shirt]], distributing his fortune among the victims of National Socialism, forswear all the vanities and pleasures of life and [[John the Baptist|live on locusts and wild honey]]\".{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=328\u201329}}\n[[File:A speer grab-1.jpg|thumb|right|Speer's grave in [[Heidelberg]]]]\nSpeer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=354}} He did an extensive, in-depth interview for the June 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, in which he stated, \"If I didn't see it, then it was because I didn't want to see it.\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=329}} In October 1973, Speer made his first trip to Britain, flying to London under an assumed name{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=354}} to be interviewed by [[Ludovic Kennedy]] on the [[BBC]] ''Midweek'' programme.{{sfn|Asher|2003}} Upon arrival, he was detained for almost eight hours at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity. [[Home Secretary]] [[Robert Carr]] allowed him into the country for 48 hours.{{sfn|Leigh|1973}} In the same year, he appeared on the television programme ''[[The World at War]]''.\n\nSpeer returned to London in 1981 to participate in the BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' program; while there, he suffered a stroke and died on September 1.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=337}} He had formed a relationship with a German woman who was living in London; he was with her at the time of his death.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=362\u201363}}\nEven to the end of his life, Speer continued to question his actions under Hitler. He asks in his final book ''Infiltration'', \"What would have happened if Hitler had asked me to make decisions that required the utmost hardness?&nbsp;... How far would I have gone?&nbsp;... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?\"{{sfn|Speer|1981|pp=12\u201313}} Speer leaves the questions unanswered.{{sfn|Speer|1981|pp=12\u201313}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy and controversy ==\nThe view of Speer as an unpolitical \"miracle man\" is challenged by Columbia historian [[Adam Tooze]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|loc=Chapter 17: Albert Speer: 'Miracle Man'}} In his 2006 book, ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'', Tooze, following Gitta Sereny, argues that Speer's ideological commitment to the Nazi cause was greater than he claimed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tooze|2006|p=553}}.

No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the ''[[Schwerbelastungsk\u00f6rper]]'' (heavy load bearing body), built around 1941. The {{convert|46|ft|adj=on}} high concrete cylinder was used to measure ground [[subsidence]] as part of feasibility studies for a massive [[triumphal arch]] and other large structures proposed as part of ''[[Welthauptstadt Germania]]'', Hitler's planned postwar renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. Along the [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni|Strasse des 17. Juni]], a double row of lampposts designed by Speer still stands.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=75}} The tribune of the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, can also be seen.{{sfn|Museen der Stadt N\u00fcrnberg}}\n\nMore of Speer's own personal work can be found in London, where he redesigned the interior of the [[Embassy of Germany in London|German Embassy]] to the United Kingdom, then located at 7\u20139 [[Carlton House Terrace]]. Since 1967, it has served as the offices of the [[Royal Society]]. His work there, stripped of its Nazi fixtures and partially covered by carpets, survives in part.{{sfn|Iconic Photos, ''A Nazi Funeral in London''}}\n\nAnother legacy was the ''Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerst\u00f6rter St\u00e4dte'' (Working group on Reconstruction of destroyed cities), authorised by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities to make them more livable in the age of the automobile.{{sfn|Durth|Gutschow|1988}} Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations.{{sfn|Durth|Gutschow|1988}} The ''Arbeitsstab'''s recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and ''Arbeitsstab'' members became prominent in the rebuilding.{{sfn|Durth|Gutschow|1988}}\n\n=== Actions regarding the Jews ===\nAs General Building Inspector, Speer was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=116}} From 1939 onward, the Department used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=116}} Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=120}} Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=119}} At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists,{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=119}} as does the ''Chronicle'' of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=124}}\n\nFollowing his release from Spandau, Speer presented to the [[German Federal Archives]] an edited version of the ''Chronicle'', stripped by Wolters of any mention of the Jews.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=339\u201343}} When [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the edited ''Chronicle'' and other documents, Wolters explained the situation to Speer, who responded by suggesting to Wolters that the relevant pages of the original ''Chronicle'' should \"cease to exist\".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=226\u201327}} Wolters did not destroy the ''Chronicle'', and, as his friendship with Speer deteriorated, allowed access to the original ''Chronicle'' to doctoral student [[:de:Matthias Schmidt (Historiker)|Matthias Schmidt]] (who, after obtaining his doctorate, developed his thesis into a book, ''Albert Speer: The End of a Myth'').{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=359\u201361}} Speer considered Wolters' actions to be a \"betrayal\" and a \"stab in the back\".{{sfn|Fest|2007|p=196}} The original ''Chronicle'' reached the Archives in 1983, after both Speer and Wolters had died.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=124}}\n\n=== Knowledge of the Holocaust ===\n[[File:Himmler45.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1945]]\nSpeer maintained at Nuremberg and in his memoirs that he had no knowledge of the Holocaust. He later wrote that in mid-1944, he was told by Hanke (by then ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Lower Silesia]]) that the minister should never accept an invitation to inspect a concentration camp in neighbouring [[Upper Silesia]], as \"he had seen something there which he was not permitted to describe and moreover could not describe\".{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=375\u201376}} Speer later concluded that Hanke must have been speaking of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and blamed himself for not inquiring further of Hanke or seeking information from Himmler or Hitler:\n\n{{quote\n| These seconds <nowiki>[when Hanke told Speer this, and Speer did not inquire]</nowiki> were uppermost in my mind when I stated to the international court at the Nuremberg Trial that, as an important member of the leadership of the Reich, I had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened. For from that moment on I was inescapably contaminated morally; from fear of discovering something which might have made me turn from my course, I had closed my eyes&nbsp;... Because I failed at that time, I still feel, to this day, responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense.{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=376}}\n}}\n\nHistorian [[Martin Kitchen]] indicates that Speer and his team were in charge of building concentration camps and were thus intimately involved in the \"Final Solution\".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=100}} He refers to a letter dated 1 February 1943 from Speer to Himmler about concentration camps containing 40,000 Jews or White Russians, suggesting that Speer had greater knowledge of the \"Final Solution\" than he admitted. When questioned, Speer denied any knowledge of this correspondence although it had gone out under his signature. Speer later insisted that he had tried to save some Jews from camps by using them in the armaments industry. These were \"undernourished, overworked slaves\", according to Kitchen, who adds that the death rate was \"exceedingly high\" among such workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=157}}\n\nMuch of the controversy over Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust has centered on his presence at the [[Posen Conference]] on October 6, 1943, at which Himmler [[Posen speeches|gave a speech]] detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders. Himmler said, \"The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth&nbsp;... In the lands we occupy, the Jewish question will be dealt with by the end of the year.\"{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=167\u201368}} Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler seems to address him directly.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=168}} In ''Inside the Third Reich'', Speer mentions his own address to the officials (which took place earlier in the day) but does not mention Himmler's speech.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=184\u201385}}{{sfn|Speer|1970|pp=312\u201313}}\n\nIn October 1971, American historian Erich Goldhagen published an article arguing that Speer was present for Himmler's speech.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1976}} According to Fest in his biography of Speer, \"Goldhagen's accusation certainly would have been more convincing\"{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=185\u201387}} had he not placed supposed incriminating statements linking Speer with the Holocaust in quotation marks, attributed to Himmler, which were in fact invented by Goldhagen.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=185\u201387}} In response, after considerable research in the German Federal Archives in [[Koblenz]], Speer said he had left Posen around noon (long before Himmler's speech) to journey to Hitler's headquarters at [[K\u0119trzyn|Rastenburg]].{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=185\u201387}} In ''Inside the Third Reich'', published before the Goldhagen article, Speer recalled that on the evening after the conference, many Nazi officials were so drunk that they needed help boarding the special train which was to take them to a meeting with Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1970|p=313}} One of his biographers, [[Dan van der Vat]], suggests this necessarily implies he must have still been present at Posen then and must have heard Himmler's speech.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=169}} In response to Goldhagen's article, Speer had alleged that in writing ''Inside the Third Reich'', he erred in reporting an incident that happened at another conference at Posen a year later, as happening in 1943.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=397}} In 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a letter from Speer dated December 23, 1971, had been found in Britain in a collection of his correspondence to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jeanty, widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer states that he had been present for Himmler's presentation in Posen. Speer wrote: \"There is no doubt \u2013 I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed.\"{{sfn|Connolly|2007}}\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were killed. The documents bore annotations in Speer's own handwriting. Speer biographer [[Gitta Sereny]] stated that, due to his workload, Speer would not have been personally aware of such activities.{{sfn|Connolly|2005}}\n\nThe debate over Speer's knowledge of, or complicity in, the Holocaust made him a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) an active part in the regime's atrocities.

They are generally easy to distinguish from other plants, mainly because of their characteristic [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics.<ref name=\"Judd\" /> However, determining genera and species of some groups such as ''[[Hieracium#Species|Hieracium]]'' is notoriously difficult (see \"[[damned yellow composite]]\" for example).\n\n=== Roots and stems ===\nMembers of the Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Stems are herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending. Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.<ref name=\"Barkley et al.\" />\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] and the stems very often contain secretory canals with [[resin]] or [[latex]] (particularly common among the Cichorioideae). The leaves can be [[phyllotaxis|alternate]], [[phyllotaxis|opposite]], or [[phyllotaxis|whorled]]. They may be simple, but are often deeply [[leaf#Morphology|lobed]] or otherwise [[leaf#Morphology|incised]], often [[leaf#Morphology|conduplicate]] or [[leaf#Morphology|revolute]]. The margins can be entire or lobed or toothed.\n\n=== Flowers ===\n\n==== Floral heads ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bidens flwr.jpg\n| width1

a \"star\" surrounded by \"rays\".<ref name=CDF /> The cluster of flowers that may appear to be a single flower, is called a ''head''.<ref name=CDF /> The entire head may move tracking the sun, like a \"smart\" solar panel, which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators.<ref name=CDF />\nAt the base of the head, and surrounding the flowers before opening, is a bundle of [[sepal]]-like [[bract]]s or scales called ''phyllaries'', which together form the ''involucre'' that protects the individual flowers in the head before opening.<ref name=CDF /> The individual heads have the smaller individual flowers arranged on a round or dome-like structure called the ''receptacle''.<ref name=CDF /> The flowers mature first at the outside, moving toward the center, with the youngest in the middle.<ref name=CDF />\n\nThe individual flowers in a head have 5 fused petals (rarely 4), but instead of sepals, have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures called ''[[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]'', which surround the fruit and can stick to animal fur or be lifted by wind, aiding in seed dispersal.<ref name=CDF /> The whitish fluffy head of a dandelion,

(1966) A dictionary of botany, including terms used in bio-chemistry, soil science, and statistics. {{LCCN|666025447}}</ref> that may look superficially like a single flower. The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].\n\nA set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called \"phyllaries\", or \"involucral bracts\". They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).\n\nEach floret may be subtended by a bract, called a \"palea\" or \"receptacular bract\". These bracts are often called \"[[chaff]]\". The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.\n\nThe florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme &mdash; above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme &mdash; all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).\n\nThe [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.\n\nThere are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze'').\n\nThe [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]].\n\n=== Fruits and seeds ===\nIn members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]], which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]'').

There are many [[apomixis|apomictic]] species in the family.\n\nSeeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela. ''[[Seed dispersal#Wind|Anemochory]]'' (wind dispersal) is common, assisted by a hairy pappus. ''[[Seed dispersal#By animals|Epizoochory]]'' is another common method, in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') has hooks, spines or some structure to attach to the fur or plumage (or even clothes, as in the photo) of an animal just to fall off later far from its mother plant.\n\n== Uses ==\nCommercially important plants in Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' ([[sunflower]]), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yac\u00f3n), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke). Plants are used as herbs and in [[herbal tea]]s and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual ''[[Matricaria chamomilla]]'' (German chamomile) and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'' (Roman chamomile). ''[[Calendula]]'' (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and [[potpourri]]. [[Echinacea purpurea|Echinacea]] is used as a medicinal tea. The wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus''). Winter tarragon (''[[Tagetes lucida]]''), is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.\n\nMany members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry.

Some species in the Apiaceae family are [[cytotoxic]].\n\n== Description ==\n\nMost Apiaceae are [[annual plant|annual]], [[biennial plant|biennial]] or [[perennial]] [[herbaceous plant|herbs]] (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody [[shrub]]s  or small trees such as ''[[Bupleurum fruticosum]]''.<ref name=Heywood>{{cite book |first1=V.H. |last1=Heywood |first2=R.K. |last2=Brummitt |first3=A. |last3=Culham |first4=O. |last4=Seberg |title=Flowering plant families of the world |date=2007 |publisher=Firefly books |location=New York, U.S |isbn=9781554072064 }}</ref>{{rp|35}} Their leaves are of variable size and [[phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]], or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate or [[pinnation|pinnatifid]], but simple and entire in some genera, e.g. ''[[Bupleurum]]''.<ref name=Stace/> Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to foetid, but absent in some species.\n\nThe defining characteristic of this family is the [[inflorescence]], the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal [[umbel]]s, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect ([[hermaphroditic]]) and [[actinomorphic]] but there may be [[zygomorphic]] petals at the edges of the umbel, as in [[carrot]] (''[[Daucus carota]]''). Some are [[plant sexual morphology|andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious]] (as in ''[[Acronema]]''), with a distinct [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] and [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five [[petal]]s, [[sepal]]s, and [[stamen]]s.\nThe [[androecium]] consists of five stamens, but there is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant ([[geitonogamy]]) is common. The [[gynoecium]] consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a [[schizocarp]] consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of ''[[Daucus]]'' spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle ''[[Sanicula europaea]]''<ref name=Heywood/> and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily [[endosperm]]<ref name=Watson>Watson, L., Dallwitz, M.J.

The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 ''Historia generalis plantarum''. With [[Robert Morison|Robert Morison's]] 1672 ''Plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova'' it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.\n\nThe family is solidly placed within the [[Apiales]] order in the [[APG III system]]. It is closely related to [[Araliaceae]] and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular [[phylogenetic]] analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]].<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n=== Genera ===\n{{Main|List of Apiaceae genera}}\n\nAccording to the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]] {{As of|2014|July|lc=yes}} 434 genera are in the family Apiaceae.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Chaerophyllum_bulbosum_-_K\u00f6hler\u2013s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-177.jpg|''[[Chaerophyllum bulbosum]]''\nFile:Apiaceae Pimpinella anisum.jpg|[[Anise]] (''Pimpinella anisum'') <br /> from Woodville (1793)<ref>Woodville, W.

[[Parsnip]] (''[[Pastinaca]] sativa''), [[carrot]] (''[[Daucus carota]]'') and [[Hamburg parsley#Root parsley|Hamburg parsley]] (''[[Petroselinum]] crispum'') produce [[tap root]]s that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce [[essential oil]]s in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are [[parsley]] (''[[Petroselinum]] crispum''), [[coriander]] (''Coriandrum sativum''), [[culantro]], and [[dill]] (''Anethum graveolens''). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with [[coriander]] (''Coriandrum sativum''), [[fennel]] (''Foeniculum vulgare''), [[cumin]] (''Cuminum cyminum''), and [[caraway]] (''Carum carvi'').\n\nOther notable cultivated Apiaceae include [[chervil]] (''Anthriscus cerefolium''), [[angelica]] (''Angelica'' spp.), [[celery]] (''Apium graveolens''), [[arracacha]] (''Arracacia xanthorrhiza''), [[Eryngium maritimum|sea holly]] (''Eryngium'' spp.), [[asafoetida]] (''Ferula asafoetida''), [[galbanum]] (''Ferula gummosa''), [[cicely]] (''Myrrhis odorata''), [[anise]] (''Pimpinella anisum''), [[lovage]] (''Levisticum officinale''), and [[Hacquetia epipactis|hacquetia]] (''Hacquetia epipactis'').<ref name=Watson/>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nGenerally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; indeed, they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm.  Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a [[companion plant]]. One reason is because the tiny flowers clustered into umbels, are well suited for [[ladybug]]s, [[parasitic wasp]]s, and predatory [[flies]], which actually drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants.  Some of the members of this family considered \"herbs\" produce scents that are believed to ...mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous ''[[Water dropwort|Oenanthe crocata]]'' has been used to stupefy fish, ''[[Cicuta douglasii]]'' has been used as an aid in suicides, and [[arrow poison]]s have been made from various other family species.\n\n''[[Daucus carota]]'' has been used as coloring for butter{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.\n\n''[[Dorema ammoniacum]]'', ''[[Ferula galbaniflua]]'', and ''[[Muskroot|Ferula sumbul]]'' are sources of [[incense]].\n\nThe woody [[Yareta|''Azorella compacta'' Phil.]] has been used in South America for fuel.\n\n== Toxicity ==\nMany species in the Apiaceae family produce phototoxic substances (called [[furanocoumarins]]) that sensitize human skin to sunlight. Contact with the plant sap of these species, followed by exposure to sunlight, may cause [[phytophotodermatitis]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319001.php |title=Phytophotodermatitis: When plants and light affect the skin |last1=Leonard |first1=Jayne |date=August 19, 2017 |website=Medical News Today |access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/sun-related-skin-condition-triggered-by-chemicals-in-certain-plants-fruits/ |title=Sun-related Skin Condition Triggered by Chemicals in Certain Plants, Fruits |last1=Davis |first1=Dawn |date=August 12, 2011 |website=Dermatology, Mayo Clinic |access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> a serious skin inflammation.\n\nPhototoxic species include ''[[Ammi majus]]'', the [[parsnip]] (''[[Pastinaca]] sativa'') and numerous species of the ''[[Heracleum (plant)|Heracleum]]'' genus, especially the giant hogweed (''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'').

The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands. In certain [[sensory neuron]]s ([[pseudounipolar neuron]]s), such as those for touch and warmth, the axons are called [[afferent nerve fiber]]s and the electrical impulse travels along these from the [[peripheral nervous system|periphery]] to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons. Nerve fibers are [[Axon#Classification|classed]] into three types \u2013 [[group A nerve fiber]]s, [[group B nerve fiber]]s, and [[group C nerve fiber]]s. Groups A and B are [[myelin]]ated, and group C are unmyelinated. These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers. Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.\n\nAn axon is one of two types of [[cytoplasm]]ic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a [[dendrite]]. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some species, axons can emanate from dendrites and these are known as axon-carrying dendrites.<ref name=\"Triarhou\">{{cite journal |last1=Triarhou |first1=LC |title=Axons emanating from dendrites: phylogenetic repercussions with Cajalian hues |journal=Frontiers in Neuroanatomy |date=2014 |volume=8 |pages=133 |doi=10.3389/fnana.2014.00133 |pmid=25477788|pmc=4235383 }}</ref> No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yau |first=KW |year=1976 |title=Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurons in the CNS of the leech |journal=[[Journal of Physiology|J.

Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely. The end branches of an axon are called [[Axon#Axon terminals|telodendria]]. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the [[axon terminal]] which joins the dendron or cell body of another neuron forming a synaptic connection. Axons make contact with other cells\u2014usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells\u2014at junctions called [[synapse]]s. In some circumstances, the axon of one neuron may form a synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron, resulting in an [[autapse]]. At a synapse, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap. Some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends\u2014these are called ''en passant'' (\"in passing\") synapses and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon.<ref name=\"LS\">{{cite book|last1=Squire|first1=Larry|title=Fundamental neuroscience|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-385-870-2|pages=61\u201365|edition=4th}}</ref> Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches.\n\nA single axon, with all its branches taken together, can [[innervate]] multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals.

Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spinal cord]] to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one [[micrometre|micrometer]] (\u00b5m) across). The largest mammalian axons can reach a diameter of up to 20&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[squid giant axon]], which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close to 1 [[millimetre]] in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. The numbers of axonal telodendria (the branching structures at the end of the axon) can also differ from one nerve fiber to the next. Axons in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) typically show multiple telodendria, with many synaptic end points. In comparison, the [[cerebellar granule cell]] axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch node from which two [[parallel fiber]]s extend. Elaborate branching allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single region of the brain.\n\nThere are two types of axons in the [[nervous system]]: [[myelin]]ated and [[unmyelinated]] axons.<ref name=\"Debanne\">{{cite journal |last1=Debanne |first1=D |last2=Campanac |first2=E |last3=Bialowas |first3=A |last4=Carlier |first4=E |last5=Alcaraz |first5=G |title=Axon physiology |journal=Physiological Reviews |date=April 2011 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=555\u2013602 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00048.2009 |pmid=21527732}}</ref> [[Myelin]] is a layer of a fatty insulating substance, which is formed by two types of [[neuroglia|glial cells]] [[Schwann cell]]s and [[oligodendrocyte]]s.

Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the myelin sheath known as [[myelin sheath gap|nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly spaced intervals. The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction]].\n\nThe myelinated axons from the [[cerebral cortex|cortical neurons]] form the bulk of the neural tissue called [[white matter]] in the brain. The myelin gives the white appearance to the [[Neural tissue|tissue]] in contrast to the [[grey matter]] of the cerebral cortex which contains the neuronal cell bodies. A similar arrangement is seen in the [[cerebellum]]. Bundles of myelinated axons make up the [[nerve tract]]s in the CNS.

This is the provision of an insulating layer, called a myelin sheath. In the peripheral nervous system axons are myelinated by [[neuroglia|glial cells]] known as Schwann cells. In the central nervous system the myelin sheath is provided by another type of glial cell, the [[oligodendrocyte]]. Schwann cells myelinate a single axon. An oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 50 axons.<ref name=\"Sadler\">{{cite book|last1=Sadler|first1=T.|title=Langman's medical embryology|date=2010|publisher=Lippincott William & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-9069-7|page=300|edition=11th}}</ref>\n\n===Nodes of Ranvier===\n{{Main|Node of Ranvier}}\n[[Node of Ranvier|Nodes of Ranvier]] (also known as ''myelin sheath gaps'') are short unmyelinated segments of a [[myelin|myelinated axon]], which are found periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath. Therefore, at the point of the node of Ranvier, the axon is reduced in diameter.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=A|author2=Young, JZ|title=The nodes of Ranvier|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=November 20, 1952|volume=140|series=Series B|issue=900|pages=301\u2013320|jstor=82721 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1952.0063|pmid=13003931}}</ref> These nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated. In [[saltatory conduction]], electrical currents produced at each node of Ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line, where they remain strong enough to generate another action potential. Thus in a myelinated axon, action potentials effectively \"jump\" from node to node, bypassing the myelinated stretches in between, resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain.\n\n===Axon terminals===\nAn axon can divide into many branches called telodendria (Greek\u2013end of tree). At the end of each '''telodendron''' is an [[axon terminal]] (also called a synaptic bouton, or terminal bouton). Axon terminals contain [[synaptic vesicle]]s that store the [[neurotransmitter]] for release at the [[Chemical synapse|synapse]]. This makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible. Sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an [[autapse]].\n\n==Action potentials==\n{{Main|Action potential}}\n{{Further |Neural coding|Active zone}}\n{{Synapse map}}\nMost axons carry signals in the form of [[action potential]]s, which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes [[chemical synapse|synaptic]] contact with target cells. The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is \"all-or-nothing\"&nbsp;\u2014 every action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size. There are, however, some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable amplitude.\n\nWhen an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes [[synaptic vesicle]]s (tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane) filled with a [[neurotransmitter]] chemical to fuse with the axon's membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through [[exocytosis]]. The neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. The neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. Depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. This entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second. Afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. The action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.<ref name=\"Debanne\"/>\n\n[[File:Example of Waveforms from Extracellular Tetrode Recordings in the Hippocampus from Different Cell Types and Axons.tif|thumb|(A) pyramidal cell, interneuron, and short durationwaveform (Axon), overlay of the three average waveforms;<br />(B) Average and standard error of peak-trough time for pyramidal cells interneurons, and putative axons;<br />(C) Scatter plot of signal to noise ratios for individual units againstpeak-trough time for axons, pyramidal cells (PYR) and interneurons (INT).]]\n\nExtracellular recordings of [[action potential]] propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals. While extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as [[place cells]], axonal activity in both [[White matter|white]] and [[gray matter]] can also be recorded. Extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150\u03bcs) than of pyramidal cells (~500\u03bcs) or interneurons (~250\u03bcs). 2. The voltage change is triphasic. 3.

Axons were known to have different thicknesses (from 0.1 to 20&nbsp;\u00b5m)<ref name=\"LS\"/> and these differences were thought to relate to the speed that an action potential could travel along the axon \u2013 its ''conductance velocity''. [[Joseph Erlanger|Erlanger]] and [[Herbert Spencer Gasser|Gasser]] proved this hypothesis, and identified several types of nerve fiber, establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and its [[nerve conduction velocity]]. They published their findings in 1941 giving the first classification of axons.\n\nAxons are classified in two systems. The first one introduced by Erlanger and Gasser, grouped the fibers into three main groups using the letters A, B, and C. These groups, [[group A nerve fiber|group A]], [[group B nerve fibres|group B]], and [[group C nerve fiber|group C]] include both the sensory fibers ([[afferent nerve fiber|afferents]]) and the motor fibres ([[efferent nerve fiber|efferents]]).

These were then introduced into a system that only included sensory fibers (though some of these were mixed nerves and were also motor fibers). This system refers to the sensory groups as Types and uses Roman numerals: Type Ia, Type Ib, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Motor}} === <!-- Motor fiber types redirects here -->\n[[Lower motor neurons]] have two kind of fibers:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Motor fiber types\n|-\n!

It was used to write the [[Aramaic language]] and had displaced the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet, for the writing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The letters all represent [[consonant]]s, some of which are also used as ''[[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'' to indicate long [[vowel]]s.\n\nThe Aramaic [[alphabet]] is historically significant since virtually all [[modern history|modern]] [[Middle East]]ern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non-[[Chinese characters|Chinese]] writing systems of Central and East Asia. That is primarily from the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the official language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] Empires, and their successor, the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Among the scripts in modern use, the [[Hebrew alphabet]] bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes. The Aramaic alphabet was an ancestor to the Nabataean alphabet and the later Arabic alphabet.\n\nWriting systems (like the Aramaic one) that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of ''matres lectionis'' or added diacritical signs, have been called [[abjad]]s by [[Peter T. Daniels]] to distinguish them from alphabets, such as the [[Greek alphabet]], which represent vowels more systematically. The term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet, which would imply that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by [[Ignace Gelb]]) or an incomplete or [[defective script|deficient alphabet]] (as most other writers have said). Rather, it is a different type.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription by the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], 3rd century BC.]]\nThe earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]].<ref>''Inland Syria and the East-of-Jordan Region in the First Millennium BCE before the Assyrian Intrusions'', Mark W. Chavalas, The Age of Solomon: Scholarship at the Turn of the Millennium, ed. Lowell K. Handy, (Brill, 1997), 169.</ref> Over time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. Aramaic gradually became the ''lingua franca'' throughout the Middle East, with the script at first complementing and then displacing [[Assyrian cuneiform]], as the predominant writing system.\n\n== Achaemenid Empire (The First Persian Empire) ==\nAround 500 BC, following the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of [[Mesopotamia]] under [[Darius I]], [[Old Aramaic]] was adopted by the Persians as the \"vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast Persian empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed as Official Aramaic, Imperial Aramaic or Achaemenid Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenid Persians in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic<!-- pp 250\u2013261 --><!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251\u2013252-->|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250\u2013261}} p. 251</ref>\n\nImperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was inevitably influenced by [[Old Persian]]. The Aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles, the \"lapidary\" form, usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments, and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to Phoenician and early Aramaic. Both were in use through the Achaemenid Persian period, but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary, which had largely disappeared by the 3rd century BC.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenfield|first1=J.C.|editor1-last=Gershevitch|editor1-first=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran: Volume 2|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=709\u2013710|chapter=Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire}}</ref>\n[[File:Stele Salm Louvre AO5009.jpg|thumb|Stele with dedicatory lapidary Aramaic inscription to the god Salm.

The Aramaic script would survive as the essential characteristics of the Iranian [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I.

The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC in the Persian Achaemenid administration of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=978-1-874780-74-8|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe widespread usage of Achaemenid Aramaic in the Middle East led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing [[Hebrew]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician, the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n===Aramaic-derived scripts===\nSince the evolution of the Aramaic alphabet out of the Phoenician one was a gradual process, the division of the world's alphabets into the ones derived from the Phoenician one directly and the ones derived from Phoenician via Aramaic is somewhat artificial. In general, the alphabets of the Mediterranean region (Anatolia, Greece, Italy) are classified as Phoenician-derived, adapted from around the 8th century BC, and those of the East (the Levant, Persia, Central Asia and India) are considered Aramaic-derived, adapted from around the 6th century BC from the Imperial Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nAfter the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the unity of the Imperial Aramaic script was lost, diversifying into a number of descendant cursives.\n\nThe Hebrew and [[Nabataean alphabet]]s, as they stood by the [[Roman era]], were little changed in style from the Imperial Aramaic alphabet.\n\nA [[cursive Hebrew]] variant developed from the early centuries AD, but it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive. By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the [[Arabic alphabet]] as it stood by the time of the early [[Islamic conquests|spread of Islam]].\n\nThe development of cursive versions of Aramaic also led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrene]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s, which formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]] and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] alphabets.<ref name=\"Kara1996\">{{cite book |first=Gy\u00f6rgy|last=Kara|chapter=Aramaic Scripts for Altaic Languages|editors=Daniels, Peter T.; Bright, William |title=The World's Writing Systems |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=535\u2013558|year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-507993-7 |title-link=The World's Writing Systems}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Turkic script]] is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in Aramaic,<ref>''Babylonian beginnings: The origin of the cuneiform writing system in comparative perspective'', Jerold S.

Thomsen]], or possibly via  [[Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b|Karosthi]] (''cf''., [[Issyk inscription]]).\n\nAramaic is also considered to be the most likely source of the [[Brahmi script]], ancestor of the [[Brahmic family of scripts]], which includes [[Devanagari]].\n\n==Languages using the alphabet==\nToday, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the [[Talmud]] are written in the Hebrew alphabet. [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]]. The near-identity of the Aramaic and the classical Hebrew alphabets caused Aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard Hebrew script in scholarly literature.\n\n===Maaloula===\n{{further|Western Neo-Aramaic}}\nIn [[Maaloula]], one of few surviving communities in which a [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] dialect is still spoken, an Aramaic institute was established in 2007 by [[Damascus University]] that teaches courses to keep the language alive. The institute's activities were suspended in 2010 amidst fears that the square Aramaic alphabet used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and all the signs with the square Aramaic script were taken down. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct [[Syriac alphabet]], although use of the Aramaic alphabet has continued to some degree.<ref name=\"institute\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0402/Easter-Sunday-A-Syrian-bid-to-resurrect-Aramaic-the-language-of-Jesus-Christ |title=Easter Sunday: A Syrian bid to resurrect Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ |last=Beach |first=Alastair |publisher=''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbrZ1W2nAs|title=\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u062a\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u062d|first=|last=Al Jazeera Documentary \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062b\u0627\u0626\u0642\u064a\u0629|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Letter<br/>name\n! colspan=\"4\" | Aramaic written using\n! rowspan=\"3\" | [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n! colspan=\"7\" | Equivalent letter in\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imperial Aramaic\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Brahmi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Kharosthi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Western Neo-Aramaic#Square Aramaic Alphabet|Maalouli Aramaic]]\n|-\n!

Originally, they represented only the consonants ''w'' and ''y'', but they were later adopted to indicate the long vowels ''\u016b'' and ''\u012b'' respectively as well (often also ''\u014d'' and ''\u0113'' respectively). In the latter role, they are known as ''{{lang|la|matres lectionis}}'' or \"mothers of reading\".\n\n\u0100lap, likewise, has some of the characteristics of a ''{{lang|la|mater lectionis}}'' because in initial positions, it indicates a [[glottal stop]] (followed by a vowel), but otherwise, it often also stands for the long vowels ''\u0101'' or ''\u0113''. Among Jews, the influence of Hebrew often led to the use of H\u0113 instead, at the end of a word.\n\nThe practice of using certain letters to hold vowel values spread to Aramaic-derived writing systems, such as in Arabic and Hebrew, which still follow the practice.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Syriac (Unicode block)|Imperial Aramaic (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe Syriac Aramaic alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September 1999, with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe Syriac Abbreviation (a type of [[overline]]) can be represented with a special control character called the [[Syriac Abbreviation Mark]] (U+070F).

The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elements of Cinematography: Camera|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/atec/midori/Handouts/camera.htm#ms|website=www.utdallas.edu|publisher=[[University of Texas at Dallas]]|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne of the other main reasons why French critics called it 'American Shot' was its frequent use in westerns. This was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy, usually holstered at his waist. It's actually the closest you can get to an actor while keeping both his face and his holstered gun in frame.\n\nThe French critics thought it was characteristic of [[Cinema of the United States|American films]] of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' American movies, such as [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.\n\n[[Howard Hawks]] legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Cinematic techniques}}\n\n[[Category:Cinematography]]\n\n{{filmmaking-stub}}", "sha1": "kfqsz1hqmn4ud226bmvu87jywozavxx"}}, {"title": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis", "ns": "0", "id": "967", "revision": {"id": "863264335", "parentid": "863263890", "timestamp": "2018-10-09T18:19:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nocowardsoulismine", "id": "5996844"}, "comment": "/* Multiple sclerosis */ author link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| synonyms        = Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis\n|name=\n|image=File:PMC4274983 fneur-05-00270-g002.png\n|alt=\n|caption=Fulminating ADEM showing many lesions.

Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these 'multiphasic' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Koelman|first=Diederik L.

Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.<ref>dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary.

This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.\n\nSensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady \"stomping\" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.\n\n[[Physician]]s can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient's finger will tend to \"fall down\" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the \"ataxic hand\").\n\n=== Vestibular ===\nThe term ''vestibular ataxia'' is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.\n\n== Causes ==\nThe three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation.\n\n=== Focal lesions ===\nAny type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum, sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord (and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]), vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).\n\n=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===\nExogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[synthetic cannabinoid]] [[Dexanabinol|HU-211]] ingestion<ref name=\"Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title=Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |format= |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211253/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and various other recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses).

Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.<ref name=\"pmid17603404\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallar G | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 527\u201336 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17603404 | doi =  }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ataxic cerebral palsy]]\n* [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]]\n* [[Bruns apraxia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, Stephens K, Adam MP, Bird TD |title=Hereditary Ataxia Overview (last revision 2012)|work=All GeneReview |year=1998 |pmid=20301317  |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1138/}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Manto M, Gruol D, Schmahmann J, Koibuchi N, Rossi F |title=Handbook of the Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders|year=2013 |work=Springer |url=https://www.springer.com/biomed/neuroscience/book/978-94-007-1332-1 }}\n\n{{Nervous and musculoskeletal system symptoms and signs}}\n{{Alcohol and health}}\n\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: Nervous system]]\n[[Category:Cerebral palsy types]]\n[[Category:Stroke]]", "sha1": "9iusnvslrsekgsg7vhch16hdv7gu9mx"}}, {"title": "AmbientCalculusOnline", "ns": "0", "id": "970", "redirect": {"title": "Ambient calculus"}, "revision": {"id": "783826856", "parentid": "160877850", "timestamp": "2017-06-04T22:25:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{R category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ambient calculus]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from CamelCase}}\n}}", "sha1": "h3rvomivwcyum7cvi322s3dwrgqn28o"}}, {"title": "Abdul Alhazred", "ns": "0", "id": "972", "revision": {"id": "866335597", "parentid": "866335077", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T18:55:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "User456541", "id": "34870230"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Fixed typo.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}\n'''Abdul Alhazred''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by American horror writer [[H.

The name may have been invented by Lovecraft himself or the Phillips' family lawyer Albert Baker.<ref>Harms, p. 7, ''The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana''.</ref>\n\n''[[Abdul]]'' (''Abd al'') is a common Arabic name component (meaning \"servant of the\") but never a name by itself. ''Alhazred'' may allude to \"Hazard\", a reference to the book's destructive and dangerous nature, or to Lovecraft's ancestors by that name.<ref>L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lovecraft, a Biography''.

Ibn al-Haytham is said to have pretended to be mad to escape the wrath of a ruler.<ref>[http://www.alephbok.se/alhazen_alhazred.html Rickard Berghorn \"Alhazen och Alhazred\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812053244/http://www.alephbok.se/alhazen_alhazred.html |date=August 12, 2010 }} {{sv icon}}</ref>\n\n''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme ''al-'' twice in a row (anomalous in terms of [[Arabic grammar]]). The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-al-Hazred'' or ''Abdul Hazred''. In Arabic translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah Al[[Heth|\u1e25]]a [[\u1e92\u0101\u02bc|\u1e93]]red'' (\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0631\u062f): Arabic ''{{transl|ar|\u1e25a\u1e93ara}}''\u062d\u0638\u0631 = \"he fenced in\", \"he prohibited\". Hazred could come from the Arabic word \"Hazrat\" meaning Great Lord with a twist that makes it sound like \"red\" and \"hazard\" both indicative of danger. It is also thought by some to be a corruption of sorts on the phrase \"All has read\", to imply he has read much, and has immense amounts of knowledge. However Abdul is a common Arabic prefix meaning \"Servant\" and \"Al\" is Arabic for \"the\", and if \"hazra\" means \"he prohibited\", \"he fenced in\" or \"Great Lord\", then the name would mean \"Servant of the Prohibited\", \"Servant of the Fenced in\", or \"Servant of the Great Lord\" which would make sense considering his role, even if it is not a proper Arabic name.\n\nAn explanation that is more in sync with Arabic usage and existing Sufi tradition is that it is a corruption of \"Abd-al-Hazra[h]\" \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0636\u0631\u0629, where \"ha\u1e93rat\" is the Persian and Ottoman Turkish form of the Arabic word \"Ha\u1e0dra[t]\" | [[Hadrat]] \u062d\u0636\u0631\u0629 meaning \"presence\" used by some speakers as an honorific title before the names of prophets, saints, and also as a mnemonic for the name of Allah, as well as a common honorific title for ordinary people. The final [[:wikt:\u0629|taa marbuta]] is customarily variably turned into \"t\" or omitted in spoken Arabic in various varieties. \"Ha\u1e0dra\" is also the name of the Sufi [[Dhikr#Sufi view|Dhikr]]<ref>[[Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi]], the Alexandrian Andalusian Sufi from the 13th century CE, is [https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=I85EDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT106&ots=Jr8dv2DS4p&dq=%22%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A9%22&pg=PT106#v=onepage&q=%22%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A9%22&f=false quoted to have said] \"All universes are slaves subdued for you, and you are the '''slave of the presence''' (lit.

A reference to the \"Mad Arab\" in [[Cthulhu Mythos]] fiction is invariably a synonym for Abdul Alhazred. Later writers sometimes preface Alhazred with words such as \"monk\" (such as in the [[Chick Publications|Chick]] parody tract [http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=135 \"Who will be Eaten First?\"] by [[Howard Hallis]]) or \"scholar\".\n\n==Biography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===H. P. Lovecraft===\n{{wikisource|History of the Necronomicon}}\nAccording to Lovecraft's \"History of the Necronomicon\" (written 1927, first published [[1938 in literature|1938]]), Alhazred was:\n\n{{quote|a mad poet of [[Sana\u00e1]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Ommiade]] [[Caliphate|caliphs]], circa 700 A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secret of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]]&mdash;the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba El Khaliyeh]] or \"Empty Space\" of the ancients&mdash;and \"[[ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]]\" or \"Crimson\" desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].}}\n\nIn 730, while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly wrote a book of ultimate evil in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''al-Azif'', which would later become known as the ''Necronomicon''. Those who have dealings with this book usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft's \"History\":\n\n{{quote|Of his final death or disappearance (738 A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan|Ebn Khallikan]] (12th cent. biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen the fabulous [[Iram of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of [[The Nameless City|a certain nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].}}\n\n===August Derleth===\n\n[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazred, such as redating his death to 731. Derleth also changed Alhazred's final fate, as described in his [[short story]] \"[[The Trail of Cthulhu|The Keeper of the Key]]\", first published in May [[1951 in literature|1951]]. In the story, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Laban Shrewsbury|Professor Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[The Trail of Cthulhu#Nayland Colum|Nayland Colum]], discover Alhazred's burial site.\n\nWhile the two are heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], they cross the border into [[Yemen]] and find the unexplored desert area that the ''Necronomicon'' calls \"Roba el Ehaliyeh\" or \"Roba el Khaliyeh\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the [[Empty Quarter]] or \"Rub al Khali\".\n\nAt the center of the area they discover the Nameless City (the setting of [[The Nameless City|the Lovecraft story of the same name]]) and in Derleth's text the domain of the [[Great Old One]] [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, an old agent of Hastur and the devoted enemy of Hastur's half-brother, Cthulhu, crosses its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site.\n\nHe indeed finds Alhazred's [[burial chamber]] and learns of his fate. Alhazred had been kidnapped in [[Damascus]] and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of the ''Necronomicon''{{'s}} lore. As punishment for betraying their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him, severed his tongue and executed him.\n\nAlthough the entrance to the chamber warns against disturbing him, Shrewsbury opens Alhazred's [[sarcophagus]] anyway, finding that only rags, bones, and dust remain of Alhazred. However, the sarcophagus also contains Alhazred's personal, incomplete copy of the ''Necronomicon'', written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Shrewsbury then uses [[necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and orders it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which reveals the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally lets Alhazred return to his eternal rest.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam]]\n*[[Astrology in medieval Islam]]\n*[[Abdul Alhazred (comics)]]\n*[[Alhazred (novel)]]\n*[[Sana'a manuscript]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author=August Derleth|chapter=The Keeper of the Key|origyear=1951|title=Quest for Cthulhu|year=2000|location=New York, NY|publisher=Carroll & Graf|isbn=0-7867-0752-6}}\n*{{cite book|last=Harms|first=Daniel|title=The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana|edition=2nd|year=1998|location=Oakland, CA|publisher=Chaosium|isbn=1-56882-119-0}}\n*{{cite book|first=Howard P|last=Lovecraft|title=History of The Necronomicon|publisher=Necronomicon Press|location=West Warwick, RI|isbn=0-318-04715-2|url=http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/12/72/}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*{{cite book|last=Pearsall|first=Anthony B.|title=The Lovecraft Lexicon|edition=1st|year=2005|location=Tempe, AZ|publisher=New Falcon|isbn=1-56184-129-3}}\n*{{cite book|last=Knaut|first=Andrew|title=Metrom|date=June 2013|publisher=Blogger|url=http://metrom.blogspot.ca/2013/06/chapter-2.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130724144720/http://metrom.blogspot.ca/2013/06/chapter-2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-24|editor=Ruby Alsharaf}}\n\n{{H.

Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived [[insanity]]. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. She was often ill in her childhood. Ada married [[William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King]] in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and Ada in turn became Countess of Lovelace.\n\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]], contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=234\u2013235}} and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician [[Charles Babbage]], also known as \"the father of computers\", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, [[Mary Somerville]].\n\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer [[Luigi Menabrea]] on the engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ''Notes''. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early [[history of computers]]. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003|pp=19, 25}} Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.<ref name=ABCL>{{Citation|last=Toole|first=Betty Alexandra|title=Poetical Science|journal=The Byron Journal|volume=15|year=1987|pages=55\u201365|doi=10.3828/bj.1987.6}}.</ref>\n\nShe died of [[uterine cancer]] in 1852 at the age of 36.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Miniature of Ada Byron.jpg|thumb|Ada, aged four]]\nByron expected his baby to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Augusta was named after Byron's half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=17}}\n\nOn 16 January 1816, Ada's mother, Annabella, at Byron's behest, left for her parents' home at [[Kirkby Mallory]], taking one-month-old Ada with her.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=35}} Although English law at the time gave fathers full custody of their children in cases of separation, Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=16}} but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=80}} On 21 April, Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=36\u201338}} Aside from an acrimonious separation, Annabella continually made allegations about Byron's immoral behaviour throughout her life.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=74\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace child portrait Somerville College.jpg|thumb|Ada, aged seven, by [[Alfred d'Orsay]], 1822, [[Somerville College, Oxford]].]]\nThis set of events made Ada famous in Victorian society. Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter, and never saw her again. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.<ref name=\"Turney p. 138\">{{Harvnb|Turney|1972|p=138}}.</ref> Ada was not shown the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her twentieth birthday.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=10}} Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856.\n\nAnnabella did not have a close relationship with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=85\u201387}} In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=86}} In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=119}}\n\n[[File:Ada Byron aged seventeen (1832).jpg|thumb|left|Ada, aged seventeen, 1832|243x243px]]\nAda was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.{{Sfn | Stein|1985|p=17}} In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of [[measles]]. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being ill, Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills. At age 12 this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the [[Bird anatomy|anatomy of birds]] to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, ''Flyology,'' illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".<ref name=ABCL/>\n\nIn early 1833, Ada had an affair with a tutor. After being caught, she tried to elope with him but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Annabella and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=120\u201321}} Ada never met her younger half-sister, [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]], the daughter of Lord Byron and [[Claire Clairmont]]. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Ada did have some contact with [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh]], the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Ada as much as possible when introduced at Court.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=155}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolor portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by [[Alfred Edward Chalon]]]]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor [[Mary Somerville]], who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=138\u201340}} and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists [[Andrew Crosse]], [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Michael Faraday]] and the author [[Charles Dickens]]. She was [[debutante|presented at Court]] at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]], Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".{{Sfn|Turney|1972|pp=138\u201339}} This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably because of the influence of her mother, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=139}}\n\nOn 8 July 1835, she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William, 8th Baron King]], becoming Lady King.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2744.htm#i27434|title=Hon.

In 1843\u201344, Ada's mother assigned [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] to teach Ada's children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=285\u201386}} He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=289\u201396}}\n\nIn 1841 Lovelace and [[Elizabeth Medora Leigh|Medora Leigh]] (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father.{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=159}} On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least ''astonished''. In fact, you merely ''confirm'' what I have for ''years and years'' felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\"{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=160}} She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"{{Sfn|Moore|1961|p=431}} In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=302}}\u2014and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than \u00a33,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.<ref>''Babbage's Dancer'' Simon Schaffer http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-babbagesdancer-print.html Retrieved 4 August 2017</ref> The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=340\u201342}} She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=336\u201337}} During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=361}}\n\n===Education===\nThroughout her illnesses, she continued her education.{{Sfn|Stein|1985|pp=28\u201330}} Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]], [[William King (physician)|William King]],<ref name=williamkings group=lower-alpha>William King, her tutor, and William King, her future husband, were not related.</ref> and [[Mary Somerville]], the noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician [[Augustus De Morgan]]. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,{{Sfn|Turney|1972|p=138}} and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".{{Sfn|Stein|1985|p=82}}\n\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying [[differential calculus]], she wrote to De Morgan:\n<blockquote>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in ''one'' shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar{{Sfn|Toole|1998|p=99}}</blockquote>\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued [[metaphysics]] as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=91\u2013100}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Ada Lovelace in 1852.jpg|thumb|Painting of Ada Lovelace at a piano in 1852 by Henry Phillips.

Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=370}} She lost contact with her husband after she confessed something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=369}} She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\n\n==Work==\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including [[phrenology]]{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=198}} and [[mesmerism]].{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=232\u201333}} After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=305}} She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=310\u201314}} In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron [[Karl von Reichenbach]], ''Researches on Magnetism'', but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=315\u201317}} In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=335}}\n\n[[File:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ada by British painter [[Margaret Sarah Carpenter]] (1836)]]\nLovelace first met [[Charles Babbage]] in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his [[Difference Engine]].{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=36\u201338}} She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills.

With the article, she appended a set of notes.{{Sfn|Menabrea|1843}} Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=265}} Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=267}} Her work was well received at the time; the scientist [[Michael Faraday]] described himself as a supporter of her writing.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p = 307}}\n\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Section G<ref name=\"fourmilab.ch\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html|title=Sketch of ''The Analytical Engine'', with notes upon the Memoir by the Translator|publisher=fourmilab.ch|place=[[Switzerland]]|date=October 1842|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, which could have run correctly had Babbage's Analytical Engine been built.<ref name=\"adaslegacy\" /> (Only his Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage|title=The Babbage Engine|publisher=Computer History Museum|year=2008}}</ref>) Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered the first computer programmer{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}} and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.<ref>Gleick, J. (2011) ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]]'', London, Fourth Estate, pp. 116\u2013118.</ref>\n\nSection G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of [[artificial intelligence]]. She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to ''originate'' anything. It can do ''whatever we know how to order it'' to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by [[Alan Turing]] in his paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEMYUU_HFMAC&pg=PA67&f=false |journal=The Turing Test: Verbal Behavior as the Hallmark of Intelligence |editor=Stuart Shieber |title=Computing Machinery and Intelligence |author=Turing, Alan |pages=67\u2013104 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement (a criticism of the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface\u2014which would imply that she had written that also. When [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Taylor]]'s ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian [[Benjamin Woolley]] theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her&nbsp;... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=277\u201380}} Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as ''Philosopher's Walk'', as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|p=307}}\n\n===First computer program===\n[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|Lovelace's diagram from Note G, the first published computer algorithm|265x265px]]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the [[University of Turin]] about his Analytical Engine. [[Luigi Menabrea]], a young Italian engineer and the future [[Prime Minister of Italy]], transcribed Babbage's lecture into [[French language|French]], and this transcript was subsequently published in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve]] in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend [[Charles Wheatstone]] commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's ''[[Scientific Memoirs]]'' under the [[initialism]] ''AAL''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University| date=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an [[algorithm]] for the Analytical Engine to compute [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is considered the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simonite|first=Tom|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03/ada-lovelace-day.html|title=Short Sharp Science: Celebrating Ada Lovelace: the 'world's first programmer'| work= [[New Scientist]]|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Matt|title=Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension|date=2014|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|isbn=0374275653|page=261}}</ref> The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.{{sfn|Kim|Toole|1999}}\n\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to [[B.V.

In her notes, she wrote:\n{{Quote|[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides ''number'', were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lovelace|first1=Ada|last2=Menabrea|first2=Luigi|title=Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq.|date=1842|journal=[[Scientific Memoirs]]|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=694}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Rowan|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22385-ada-lovelace-my-brain-is-more-than-merely-mortal.html|title=Ada Lovelace: My brain is more than merely mortal|work=New Scientist|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. [[Walter Isaacson]] ascribes Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to ''any'' process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used [[punched cards|punchcards]] to direct the weaving of beautiful [[pattern]]s, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson\">Isaacson, Walter. \"[http://fortune.com/2014/09/18/walter-isaacson-the-women-of-eniac/ Walter Isaacson on the women of ENIAC].\" Fortune magazine. 18 September 2014.</ref> This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer [[John Graham-Cumming]], whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.{{Sfn|Toole|1998|pp=2\u20133, 14}}{{Sfn|Woolley|1999|pp=272\u201377}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kent|first=Leo|url=http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|title=The 10-year-plan to build Babbage's Analytical Engine|publisher=Humans Invent|date=17 September 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014123843/http://www.humansinvent.com/#!/8947/the-10-year-plan-to-build-babbages-analytical-engine|archive-date=14 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist [[Doron Swade]]: <blockquote>Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw\u2014what Ada Byron saw\u2014was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.{{Sfn|Fuegi|Francis|2003}}</blockquote>\n\n===Controversy over extent of contributions===\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers and historians of computing claim otherwise.\n\n[[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan G. Bromley]], in the 1990 article ''Difference and Analytical Engines'':\n{{quote|All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a 'bug' in it.

While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that \"there's nothing as sophisticated\u2014or as clean\u2014as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did.\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People|date=2016|publisher=Wolfram Media|isbn=1579550037|pages=45\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Doron Swade]], a specialist on [[history of computing]] known for his work on Babbage, analyzed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine:\n#She was a mathematical genius\n#She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\n#She was the first computer programmer\n#She was a prophet of the computer age\n\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she couldn't have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K5p_tBcrd0&t=36m29s|title=Doron Swade: \"Charles Babbage and Difference Enginge No. 2\" - Talks at Google|first=|last=Talks at Google|date=12 May 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Ada Lovelace color.svg|thumb|upright|An illustration inspired by the [[A.

anthologist. Though best remembered as the first book publisher of the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and for his own contributions to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and the [[Lovecraftian horror|Cosmic Horror]] genre, as well as his founding of the publisher [[Arkham House]] (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK), Derleth was a leading American [[American literary regionalism|regional writer]] of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including  [[historical fiction]], [[poetry]], [[detective fiction]], [[science fiction]], and [[biography]].\n\nA 1938 [[Guggenheim Fellow]], Derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious ''Sac Prairie Saga'', a series of fiction, historical fiction, poetry, and non-fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the Wisconsin he knew. Derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Life==\nThe son of William Julius Derleth and Rose Louise Volk, Derleth grew up in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"captimes2\">\"August Derleth Services Wednesday in Sauk City\", ''Capital Times'', July 6, 1971, p. 24, col. 2.</ref> He was educated in local parochial and public high school. Derleth wrote his first fiction at age 13. He was interested most in reading, and he made three trips to the library a week. He would save his money to buy books (his personal library exceeded 12,000 later on in life). Some of his biggest influences were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essays, [[Walt Whitman]], [[H. L. Mencken]]'s [[The American Mercury]], [[Samuel Johnson]]'s [[The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia]], [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walter Scott]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s [[Walden]].\n\nForty rejected stories and three years later{{when|date=March 2018}}, according to anthologist Jim Stephens, he sold his first story, \"Bat's Belfry\", to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth wrote throughout his four years at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]], where he received a [[Bachelor's Degree|B.A.]] in 1930.<ref name=\"captimes1\">{{cite news|title=Author August Derleth Dies|date=July 5, 1971|publisher=''Capital Times''|page=1, col. 6}}</ref> During this time he also served briefly as associate editor of Minneapolis-based [[Fawcett Publications]] ''[[Mystic Magazine]]''.\n\nReturning to Sauk City in the summer of 1931, Derleth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend [[Mark Schorer]] (later Chairman of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] English Department). They rented a cabin, writing Gothic and other horror stories and selling them\nto ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth won a place on the O'Brien Roll of Honor for ''Five Alone'', published in ''Place of Hawks'', but was first found in ''Pagany'' magazine.\n\nAs a result of his early work on the ''Sac Prairie Saga'', Derleth was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship; his sponsors were Helen C. White, Nobel Prize-winning novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] and poet [[Edgar Lee Masters]] of ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]'' fame.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Derleth organized a Ranger's Club for young people, served as clerk and president of the local [[Board of education|school board]], served as a parole officer, organized a local men's club and a [[parent-teacher association]].<ref>\n[http://www.derleth.org/autobiog.htm Derleth, August. \"An Autobiography.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121500/http://www.derleth.org/autobiog.htm |date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> He also lectured in American regional literature at the University of Wisconsin and was a contributing editor of ''Outdoors Magazine''.\n\nWith longtime friend [[Donald Wandrei]], Derleth in 1939 founded [[Arkham House]].  Its initial objective was to publish the works of H. P. Lovecraft, with whom Derleth had corresponded since his teenage years. At the same time, he began teaching a course in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1941, he became literary editor of ''[[The Capital Times]]'' newspaper in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], a post he held until his resignation in 1960. His hobbies included fencing, swimming, chess, [[philately]] and comic-strips (Derleth reportedly deployed the funding from his Guggenheim Fellowship to bind his comic book collection, most recently valued in the millions of dollars, rather than to travel abroad as the award intended.).  Derleth's true [[avocation]], however, was hiking the terrain of his native Wisconsin lands, and observing and recording nature with an expert eye.\n\nDerleth once wrote of his writing methods, \"I write very swiftly, from 750,000 to a million words yearly, very little of it pulp material.\"\n\nIn 1948, he was elected president of the Associated Fantasy Publishers at the [[6th World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Toronto]].<ref name=\"chtr480926\">{{cite news |first=Vincent |last=Starett |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Books Alive |page=4-4 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1948/09/26/page/184/article/magazine-of-books |date=September 26, 1948 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe was married April 6, 1953, to Sandra Evelyn Winters.  They divorced six years later.<ref name=\"captimes1\" />  Derleth retained custody of the couple's two children, April Rose and Walden William. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994. She remained in that capacity until her death. She was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian. April died on March 21, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: April R. Derleth|url=http://www.sfsite.com/news/2011/03/22/obituary-april-r-derleth/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called ''Hawk and Whippoorwill'', dedicated to poems of man and nature.\n\nDerleth died of a heart attack on July 4, 1971,<ref>{{cite news|title=Author August Derleth Dies|date=July 5, 1971|publisher=''Capital Times''|page=1, col. 6|quote=August Derleth, 62, famed Wisconsin author and publisher, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack.}}</ref> and is buried in St. Aloysius Cemetery in Sauk City.<ref name=\"captimes2\" /> The [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|U.S. 12]] bridge over the [[Wisconsin River]] is named in his honor. Derleth was Roman Catholic.<ref>[http://www.catholicauthors.com/derleth.html catholicauthors.com]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDerleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime.\n\n===The ''Sac Prairie Saga''===\nDerleth wrote an expansive series of novels, short stories, journals, poems, and other works about Sac Prairie (whose prototype is [[Sauk City]]). Derleth intended this series to comprise up to 50 novels telling the projected life-story of the region from the 19th century onwards, with analogies to [[Balzac]]'s ''[[La Com\u00e9die humaine|Human Comedy]]'' and [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.\n\nThis, and other early work by Derleth, made him a well-known figure among the regional literary figures of his time: early [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Hamlin Garland]] and [[Zona Gale]], as well as Sinclair Lewis, the last both an admirer and critic of Derleth.\n\nAs Edward Wagenknecht wrote in ''Cavalcade of the American Novel'', \"What Mr. Derleth has that is lacking...in modern novelists generally, is a country. He belongs. He writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. In his fictional world, there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology. It is clear, too, that he did not get the best, and most fictionally useful, part of his background material from research in the library; like Scott, in his Border novels, he gives, rather, the impression of having drunk it in with his mother's milk.\"\n\nJim Stephens, editor of ''An August Derleth Reader'', (1992), argues: \"what Derleth accomplished....was to gather a Wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life.\"\n\nThe author inaugurated the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' with four novellas comprising ''Place of Hawks'', published by Loring & Mussey in 1935. At publication, ''[[The Detroit News]]'' wrote: \"Certainly with this book Mr. Derleth may be added to the American writers of distinction.\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Wandrei| first = Donald| title = 100 books by August Derleth| url = https://books.google.com/?id=c6ENAQAAIAAJ| accessdate = February 14, 2011| year = 1962| publisher = [[Arkham House]]| page = 115 }}</ref>\n\nDerleth's first novel, ''Still is the Summer Night'', was published two years later by the famous [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Charles Scribners']] editor [[Maxwell Perkins]], and was the second in his Sac Prairie Saga.\n\n''Village Year'', the first in a series of journals\u2013meditations on nature, Midwestern village American life, and more\u2013was published in 1941 to praise from ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': \"A book of instant sensitive responsiveness...recreates its scene with acuteness and beauty, and makes an unusual contribution to the Americana of the present day.\" The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' observed that \"Derleth...deepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background; with the people projected against this, the writing comes to have the quality of an old Flemish picture, humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond.\" James Grey, writing in the ''[[St. Louis Dispatch]]'' concluded, \"Derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the ''Spoon River Anthology''.\"\n\nIn the same year, ''Evening in Spring'' was published by Charles Scribners & Sons. This work Derleth considered among his finest. What ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'' called \"this beautiful little love story\", is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small-town religious bigotry. The work received critical praise: ''[[The New Yorker]]'' considered it a story told \"with tenderness and charm\", while the ''Chicago Tribune''  concluded: \"It's as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told, with rekindled emotion, of the pangs of pain and the sharp, clear sweetness of a boy's first love.\" Helen Constance White, wrote in ''The Capital Times'' that it was \"...the best articulated, the most fully disciplined of his stories.\"\n\nThese were followed in 1943 with ''Shadow of Night'', a Scribners' novel of which ''[[The Chicago Sun]]'' wrote: \"Structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel...A [[psychological novel]] of the first order, and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting.\"\n\nIn November 1945, however, Derleth's work was attacked by his one-time admirer and mentor, Sinclair Lewis. Writing in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Lewis observed, \"It is a proof of Mr. Derleth's merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular Avalon: The [[Wisconsin River]] shining among its islands, and the castles of Baron Pierneau and Hercules Dousman.  He is a champion and a justification of regionalism.  Yet he is also a burly, bounding, bustling, self-confident, opinionated, and highly-sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues.  If he could ever be persuaded that he isn't half as good as he thinks he is, if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil, he might become twice as good as he thinks he is\u2013which would about rank him with Homer.\" Derleth good-humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater, on the back cover of his 1948 country journal: ''Village Daybook''.\n\nA lighter side to the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' is a series of quasi-autobiographical short stories known as the \"Gus Elker Stories\", amusing tales of country life that [[Peter Ruber]], Derleth's last editor, said were \"...models of construction and...fused with some of the most memorable characters in American literature.\" Most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s, though the last, \"Tail of the Dog\", was published in 1959 and won the ''Scholastic Magazine'' short story award for the year. The series was collected and republished in ''Country Matters'' in 1996.\n\n''Walden West'', published in 1961, is considered by many Derleth's finest work. This prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of Sac Prairie journals, but is organized around three themes: \"the persistence of memory...the sounds and odors of the country...and Thoreau's observation that the 'mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.'\"  A blend of nature writing, philosophic musings, and careful observation of the people and place of \"Sac Prairie.\" Of this work, George Vukelich, author of \"North Country Notebook\", writes: \"Derleth's ''Walden West'' is...the equal of Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg,Ohio'', Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'', and Edgar Lee Masters' ''Spoon River Anthology''.\"  This was followed eight years later by ''Return to Walden West'', a work of similar quality, but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing, notes critic [[Norbert Blei]].\n\nA close literary relative of the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' was Derleth's ''Wisconsin Saga'', which comprises several historical novels.\n\n===Detective and mystery fiction===\nDetective fiction represented another substantial body of Derleth's work. Most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pastiche of [[Sherlock Holmes]], whose creator, Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], he admired greatly. These included one published novel as well (''Mr. Fairlie's Final Journey''). The series features a (Sherlock Holmes-styled) British detective named [[Solar Pons]], of [[Praed Street]] in London. The series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as [[Ellery Queen]] ([[Frederic Dannay]]), [[Anthony Boucher]], [[Vincent Starrett]] and [[Howard Haycraft]].\n\nIn his 1944 volume ''The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes'', Ellery Queen wrote of Derleth's ''The Norcross Riddle'', an early Pons story: \"How many budding authors, not even old enough to vote, could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity?\" Queen adds, \"...and his choice of the euphonic Solar Pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of Sherlockian nomenclature.\"  Vincent Starrett, in his foreword to the 1964 edition of ''The Casebook of Solar Pons'', wrote that the series is \"...as sparkling a galaxy of Sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end.\"\n\nDespite close similarities to Doyle's creation, Pons lived in the post-World War I era, in the decade of the 1920s. Though Derleth never wrote a Pons novel to equal ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'', editor Peter Ruber wrote: \"...Derleth produced more than a few Solar Pons stories almost as good as Sir Arthur's, and many that had better plot construction.\"\n\nAlthough these stories were a form of diversion for Derleth, Ruber, who edited ''[[The Original Text Solar Pons Omnibus Edition]]'' (2000), argued: \"Because the stories were generally of such high quality, they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery fiction, rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nSome of the stories were self-published, through a new imprint called \"[[Mycroft & Moran]]\", an appellation of humorous significance to Holmesian scholars.  For approximately a decade, an active supporting group was the Praed Street Irregulars, patterned after the [[The Baker Street Irregulars|Baker Street Irregulars]].\n\nIn 1946, Conan Doyle's two sons made some attempts to force Derleth to cease publishing the Solar Pons series, but the efforts were unsuccessful and eventually withdrawn.<ref>Peter Ruber. [http://www.batteredbox.com/AugustDerlethMycroft/FinalAdventureSolarPond.htm \"Introduction\"] in August Derleth, ''The Final Adventures of Solar Pons'', Shelburne, Ont.: M&M, 1998.</ref>\n\nDerleth's mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in Sac Prairie and featuring Judge Peck as the central character.\n\n===Youth and children's fiction===\nDerleth wrote many and varied children's works, including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer [[Jacques Marquette|Fr. Marquette]], as well as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].  Arguably most important among his works for younger readers, however, is the Steve and Sim Mystery Series, also known as the Mill Creek Irregulars series.<ref>[http://series-books.com/millcreek/stevesim.html The Mill Creek Irregulars by August Derleth]</ref>  The ten-volume series, published between 1958 and 1970, is set in Sac Prairie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the ''Sac Prairie Saga'', as well as an extension of Derleth's body of mystery fiction.  Robert Hood, writing in the ''New York Times'' said: \"Steve and Sim, the major characters, are twentieth-century cousins of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; Derleth's minor characters, little gems of comic drawing.\" The first novel in the series, ''The Moon Tenders'', does, in fact, involve a rafting adventure down the [[Wisconsin River]], which led regional writer [[Jesse Stuart]] to suggest the novel was one that \"older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth.\" The connection to the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' was noted by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'': \"Once again a small midwest community in 1920s is depicted with perception, skill, and dry humor.\"\n\n[[File:Weird Tales September 1941.jpg|thumb|right|Derleth's first Mythos story, \"Beyond the Threshold\" was featured on the cover of ''Weird Tales'' in September 1941]]\n\n===Arkham House and the \"Cthulhu Mythos\"===\nDerleth was a correspondent and friend of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] \u2013 when Lovecraft wrote about \"le Comte d'Erlette\" in [[List of Works by H. P. Lovecraft|his fiction]], it was in homage to Derleth.  Derleth invented the term \"Cthulhu Mythos\" to describe the fictional universe described in the series of stories shared by Lovecraft and other writers in his circle.\n\nWhen Lovecraft died in 1937, Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]] assembled a collection of Lovecraft's stories and tried to get them published. Existing publishers showed little interest, so Derleth and Wandrei founded [[Arkham House]] in 1939 for that purpose. The name of the company derived from Lovecraft's fictional town of [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]], which features in many of his stories. In 1939 Arkham House published ''[[The Outsider and Others]]'', a huge collection that contained most of Lovecraft's known short stories. Derleth and Wandrei soon expanded Arkham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book, ''[[Someone in the Dark]]'', a collection of some of Derleth's own horror stories, was published  in 1941.\n\nFollowing Lovecraft's death, Derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by Lovecraft. These were published in ''Weird Tales'' and later in book form, under the byline \"H. P. Lovecraft and August Derleth\", with Derleth calling himself a \"posthumous collaborator.\" This practice has raised objections in some quarters that Derleth simply used Lovecraft's name to market what was essentially his own fiction; [[S. T. Joshi]] refers to the \"posthumous collaborations\" as marking the beginning of \"perhaps the most disreputable phase of Derleth's activities\".<ref>Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: A Life'', Necronomicon Press 1996, p.638.</ref>\n\nA significant number of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] fans and critics, such as [[Dirk W. Mosig]],<ref>Mosig, \"H. P. Lovecraft: Myth Maker\" (1976), collected in ''Mosig at Last'', Necronomicon Press 1997.</ref> [[S. T. Joshi]],<ref>Joshi, ''H. P. Lovecraft: A Life'', Necronomicon Press 1996, pp. 403\u20134.</ref> and [[Richard L. Tierney]]<ref>\"The Derleth Mythos\" in Meade & Penny Frierson (eds), ''HPL'' (1972)</ref> were dissatisfied with Derleth's invention of the term ''Cthulhu Mythos'' (Lovecraft himself used ''Yog-Sothothery'') and his presentation of Lovecraft's fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting Derleth's own Christian world view, which they contrast with Lovecraft's depiction of an amoral universe. However [[Robert M. Price]] points out that while Derleth's tales are distinct from Lovecraft's in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil, nevertheless the basis of Derlerth's systemization are found in Lovecraft. He also suggests that the differences can be overstated:\n<blockquote>\nDerleth ''was'' more optimistic than Lovecraft in his conception of the Mythos, but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind. There are indeed tales wherein Derleth's protagonists get off scot-free (like \"The Shadow in the Attic\", \"Witches' Hollow\", or \"The Shuttered Room\"), but often the hero is doomed (e.g., \"The House in the Valley\", \"The Peabody Heritage\", \"Something in Wood\"), as in Lovecraft. And it must be remembered that an occasional Lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds, e.g., in \"The Horror in the Museum\", \"The Shunned House\", and 'The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217054944/http://www.crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> \n</blockquote>\nDerleth also treated Lovecraft's [[Old Ones]] as representatives of elemental forces, creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework.\n\nSuch debates aside, Derleth's founding of Arkham House and his successful effort to rescue Lovecraft from literary obscurity are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field. For instance, [[Ramsey Campbell]] has acknowledged Derleth's encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career,<ref>For example, in ''The Count of Thirty'' (Necronomicon Press 1993), p.11.</ref> and [[Kirby McCauley]] has cited Derleth and Arkham House as an inspiration for his own anthology, ''[[Dark Forces (book)|Dark Forces]]''.<ref>Kirby McCauley, Introduction, ''Dark Forces'' (1980).</ref>  Arkham House and Derleth published ''[[Dark Carnival (short story collection)|Dark Carnival]]'', the first book by [[Ray Bradbury]], as well. [[Brian Lumley]] cites the importance of Derleth to his own Lovecraftian work, and contends in a 2009 introduction to Derleth's work that he was \"...one of the first, finest, and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction.\"\n\nImportant as was Derleth's work to rescue H.P. Lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lovecraft's death, Derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own; still frequently anthologized.  The best of this work, recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories\u2013most of which were originally published in ''Weird Tales'', illustrates Derleth's original abilities in the genre.  While Derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts, the compilers of these four anthologies, including Ramsey Campbell, note that the stories still resonate after more than fifty years.\n\nIn 2009, [[The Library of America]] selected Derleth's story ''The Panelled Room'' for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales.\n\n===Other works===\nDerleth also wrote many historical novels, as part of both the ''Sac Prairie Saga'' and the ''Wisconsin Saga''.  He also wrote history; arguably most notable among these was ''The Wisconsin: River of a Thousand Isles'', published in 1942.  The work was one in a series entitled \"The Rivers of America\", conceived by writer Constance Lindsay Skinner in the [[Great Depression]] as a series that would connect Americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation. Skinner wanted the series to be written by artists, not academicians. Derleth, while not a trained historian, was, according to former Wisconsin state historian William F. Thompson, \"...a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals... .\"  In the foreword to the 1985 reissue of the work by [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], Thompson concluded: \"No other writer, of whatever background or training, knew and understood his particular 'corner of the earth' better than August Derleth.\"\n\nDerleth wrote several volumes of poems, as well as biographies of [[Zona Gale]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].\n\nHe also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics, such as ''[[Buster Brown]]'', ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'', and ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'', as well as a book of children's poetry entitled ''A Boy's Way'', and the foreword to ''[[Tales from an Indian Lodge]]'' by ''[[Phebe Jewell Nichols]].'' Derleth also wrote under the [[nom de plume|noms de plume]] Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.\n\nDerleth's papers and comic book collection (valued at a considerable sum upon his death) were donated to the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] in Madison.<ref>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9140&search_term=derleth Derleth, August, 1909\u20131971<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Novels===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n'''Sac Prairie Saga'''\n* ''Still is the Summer Night'' (1937)\n* ''Wind Over Wisconsin'' (1938)\n* ''Any Day Now'' (1938)\n* ''Restless is the River'' (1939)\n* ''Evening in Spring'' (1941)\n* ''Sweet Genevieve'' (1942)\n* ''Shadow of Night'' (1943)\n* ''The Shield of the Valiant'' (1945)\n* ''The House of Moonlight'' (1953)\n'''Other'''\n* ''Murder Stalks the Wakely Family'' (1934)\n* ''The Man on All Fours'' (1934)\n* ''Three Who Died'' (1935)\n* ''Sign of Fear'' (1935)\n* ''Sentence Deferred'' (1939)\n* ''The Narracong Riddle'' (1940)\n* ''Bright Journey'' (1940)\n* ''The Seven Who Waited'' (1943)\n* ''Mischief in the Lane'' (1944)\n* ''No Future for Luana'' (1945)\n* ''Oliver, The Wayward Owl'' (1945)\n* ''The Country of the Hawk'' (1952)\n* ''The Captive Island'' (1952)\n* ''Fell Purpose'' (1953)\n* ''Death by Design'' (1953)\n* ''Empire of Fur'' (1953)\n* ''Land of Gray Gold'' (1954)\n* ''Land of Sky Blue Waters'' (1955)\n* ''The House on the Mound'' (1958)\n* ''The Moon Tenders'' (1958)\n* ''Wilbur, The Trusting Whippoorwill'' (1959)\n* ''The Mill Creek Irregulars'' (1959)\n* ''The Pinkertons Ride Again'' (1960)\n* ''The Ghost of Blackhawk Island'' (1961)\n* ''Sweet Land of Michigan'' (1962)\n* ''The Tent Show Summer'' (1963)\n* ''The Irregulars Strike Again'' (1964)\n* ''The House by the River'' (1965)\n* ''The Watcher on the Heights'' (1966)\n* ''The Beast in Holger's Woods'' (1968)\n* ''The Prince Goes West'' (1968)\n* ''Three Straw Men'' (1970)\n}}\n\n===Sac Prairie Saga===\n* ''Place of Hawks'' (1935)\n* ''Country Growth'' (1940)\n* ''Wisconsin Earth: A Sac Prairie Sampler'' (1948)\n* ''Sac Prairie People'' (1948)\n* ''Wisconsin in Their Bones'' (1961)\n* ''Country Matters'' (1996)\n* ''Return to Sac Prairie'' (1996)\n* ''The Lost Sac Prairie Novels'' (2000), including ''The Odyssey of Janna Meade'' (first published in the ''[[Star Weekly]]'' magazine December 3, 1949); ''The Wind in the Cedars'' (also as ''Happiness Shall Not Escape'') (first published in Redbook Magazine, January 1946), ''Lamplight for the Dark'' (first published in Redbook Magazine January 1941); ''Shane's Girls'' (also as ''Happiness is a Gift'') (first published in Redbook Magazine 1948)\n\n===Solar Pons===\n* ''[[In Re: Sherlock Holmes|\"In Re: Sherlock Holmes\" \u2013 The Adventures of Solar Pons]]'' (UK: ''The Adventures of Solar Pons'') (1945)\n* ''[[The Memoirs of Solar Pons]]'' (1951)\n* ''[[Three Problems for Solar Pons]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[The Return of Solar Pons]]'' (1958)\n* ''[[The Reminiscences of Solar Pons]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[Mr. Fairlie's Final Journey]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[The Casebook of Solar Pons]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[A Praed Street Dossier]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[The Chronicles of Solar Pons]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[The Solar Pons Omnibus]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[The Final Adventures of Solar Pons]]'' (1998)\n\n''' Horror & Cthulhu Mythos'''\n* ''[[Someone in the Dark]]'' (1941)\n* ''[[Something Near]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[Not Long for this World]]'' (1948)\n* ''[[The Survivor and Others]]'' (1957) with [[H.

Extreme shortening <!-- why shortening? --> caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French\u2013Italian border, and at {{convert|4810|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|{{convert|4000|m|ft}}]].\n\nThe altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era. A [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian\u2013Italian border in 1991.\n\nBy the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.\n\nThe Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps. At present, the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.<ref name = \"Chatr\u00e98\">Chatr\u00e9, Baptiste, et al.

[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], an ancient commentator of [[Virgil]], says in his commentary (''A.'' X 13) that all high mountains are called ''Alpes'' by Celts. The term may be common to [[Italo-Celtic]], because the [[Celtic languages]] have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''.\n\nThis may be consistent with the theory that in Greek ''Alpes'' is a name of non-Indo-European origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the Mediterranean region). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Latin ''Alpes'' might possibly derive from a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] word *''alb'' \"hill\"; \"Albania\" is a related derivation. Albania, a name not native to the region known as the country of [[Albania]], has been used as a name for a number of mountainous areas across Europe. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], \"Albania\" was a name for the eastern [[Caucasus]], while in the English languages \"Albania\" (or \"Albany\") was occasionally used as a name for [[Scotland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Albania&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=May 14, 1955 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref> although many scholars{{Who|date=April 2017}} point out this is more likely derived from the Latin ''albus'', the color white.\n\nIn modern languages the term ''alp'', ''alm'', ''albe'' or ''alpe'' refers to a [[Transhumance in the Alps|grazing pastures]] in the alpine regions below the glaciers, not the peaks.<ref name=Schmid93>Schmid et al.

The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Switzerland, France (21.4%), Austria (28.7% of the total area) and Italy (27.2%).\n\nThe highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] valley, from [[Mont Blanc]] to the [[Matterhorn]] and [[Monte Rosa]] on the southern side, and the [[Bernese Alps]] on the northern.

This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. The [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]] with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff63ff\" /> Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and [[Scree|talus slopes]] are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys.<ref name=\"Gerrard132\">Gerrard, (1990), 132</ref> [[Moraine]]s, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, centre and the terminus of glaciers.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff63ff\" />\n\n[[File:Jungfraujoch img 3699.jpg|thumb|Inside a glacier at the top of the train station at the [[Jungfraujoch]]]]\n\nAlpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks.  The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous [[crevasse]]s, often invisible under new snowfall, which cause the greatest danger to mountaineers.<ref name=\"Shoumatoff71ff\"/>\n\nGlaciers end in ice caves (the [[Rh\u00f4ne Glacier]]), by trailing into a lake or river, or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow.

For example, each year more water is diverted from rivers for [[snowmaking]] in the ski resorts, the effect of which is yet unknown. Furthermore, the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower-than-expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the Alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands.<ref name=\"Benniston et al. 2011, 1\"/><ref>Chatr\u00e9, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 13</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n{{main|Climate of the Alps|High Alps}}\n\nThe Alps are a classic example of what happens when a [[Temperateness|temperate]] area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain. Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=737}} The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.<ref>Fleming (2000), 3</ref>\n\n[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside (2007; the surface is {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} lower than 150 years ago)]]\n\nThe severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]]. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists.<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\">Ceben (1998), 22\u201324</ref> Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the [[Aosta]] valley in Italy, the [[Maurienne]] in France, the [[Valais]] in Switzerland, and northern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].<ref name=\"Ceben 22\u201324\" />\n\nThe areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff.<ref name=\"Ceben 1998, 31\"/>  The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year to {{convert|3600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between {{convert|1,000|and|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2,400|to|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.<ref>Ceben (1998), 34\u201336</ref>\n\nThe Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=on|0}}, depending on the location. The [[montane]] zone extends from {{convert|800|to|1,700|m|abbr=on|0}}, followed by the sub-Alpine zone from {{convert|1,600|to|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}. The Alpine zone, extending from [[tree line]] to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.<ref>Viazzo (1980), 17</ref>\n\nVarious models of [[climate change]] have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.<ref>Benniston (2011), 3\u20134</ref> Significant changes, of both natural and anthropogenic origins, have already been diagnosed from observations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huss|first=Matthias|last2=Hock|first2=Regine|last3=Bauder|first3=Andreas|last4=Funk|first4=Martin|date=May 1, 2010|title=100-year mass changes in the Swiss Alps linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL042616/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=L10501|doi=10.1029/2010GL042616|issn=1944-8007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|date=January 1, 2013|title=Atlantic influence on spring snowfall over the Alps in the past 150 years|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=3/a=034026|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=034026|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|last4=Navarra|first4=Antonio|date=January 15, 2015|title=Observed shift towards earlier spring discharge in the main Alpine rivers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714008912|journal=Science of the Total Environment|series=Towards a better understanding of the links between stressors, hazard assessment and ecosystem services under water scarcity|volume=503\u2013504|pages=222\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.036|hdl=2122/9055}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{main|Flora of the Alps}}\n\n[[File:Gentiana clusii03.jpg|thumb|Stemless gentian (''[[Gentiana acaulis]]'')]]\n\nThirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions.<ref name = \"Chatr\u00e98\"/> Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be [[limestone]] or non-calcareous.

Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.<ref name = \"Shoumatoff123ff\"/> Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]] and, in many areas, [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].<ref>Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135</ref>\n\nIn the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily.

After contracting [[tuberculosis]] in 1930, he had to end his [[Association football|football]] activities: he had been a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for a prominent Algerian university team. In addition, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, [[car parts]] clerk, and assistant at the [[Meteorological]] Institute. He completed his ''[[Licence (France)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\"),<ref>Alan D.

Camus joined the activities of the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Le Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien''), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades, who in 1937 denounced him as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] and expelled him from the party. Camus then became associated with the French [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement.\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the ''Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes'' (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''Le Libertaire'', ''La r\u00e9volution Prol\u00e9tarienne'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (Workers' Solidarity), the organ of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] (National Confederation of Labor). Camus stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. He again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers' uprising in [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Pozna\u0144]], Poland, and then later in the year with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\nCamus was irreligious.<ref>David Simpson writes that Camus affirmed \"a defiantly atheistic creed.\" [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/camus.htm Albert Camus (1913&ndash;1960)], The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2006.

It lasted until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, ''Alger-R\u00e9publicain''. His work included a report on the poor conditions for peasants in [[Kabylie]], which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected by the French army because of his [[tuberculosis]].\n\nIn 1940, Camus married [[Francine Faure]], a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved her, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage.<ref>{{cite web|author = Stephen C.

He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria, in 1942.\n\n===Football===\nCamus was once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, [[Soccer|football]] or the theatre.

Any football  ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17. The affliction, which was then incurable, caused Camus to be bedridden for long and painful periods.\n\nWhen Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumnus sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following: \"After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA.\"<ref name = \"rhybma\"/> Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. Camus's belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.<ref name=\"rhybma\" />\n\nA professional footballer appears as a character in ''The Plague'' and football is discussed in the dialogue.\n\n===Revolutionary Union Movement and Europe===\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nAs he wrote in [[The Rebel (book)|''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'']] (''The Rebel''), in the chapter about \"The Thought on [[Midday]]\", Camus was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la ''pens\u00e9e solaire''). In 1947\u201348, he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement (''Groupes de liaison internationale'' \u2013 GLI)<ref name=\"Todd\" /> a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (''Syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire''). According to Olivier Todd, in his biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of Andr\u00e9 Breton. For more, see the book ''Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement r\u00e9volutionnaire international'' by Christian Gras.\n\nHis colleagues were Nicolas Lazar\u00e9vitch, [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Bo\u00eb (see the article: \"Nicolas Lazar\u00e9vitch, Itin\u00e9raire d'un syndicaliste r\u00e9volutionnaire\" by Sylvain Boulouque in the review ''Communisme'', n\u00b0 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]].\n\nFrom 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with [[Altiero Spinelli]] who founded the [[European Federalist Movement]] in Milan\u2014see [[Ventotene Manifesto]] and the book \"Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati\", Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus.\n\nIn 1944, Camus founded the \"French Committee for the European Federation\" (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais pour la F\u00e9deration Europ\u00e9enne'' \u2013 CFFE) declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"\n\nFrom 22 to 25 March 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, [[George Orwell]], [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Andr\u00e9 Philip]], [[Daniel Mayer]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bondy]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]].<ref>See the book ''The Biography of Europe'' by Pan Drakopoulos.</ref> This specific branch of the [[European Federalist Movement]] disintegrated in 1957 after [[Winston Churchill]]'s ideas about European integration rose to dominance.\n\n===Death===\nCamus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near [[Sens]], in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of [[Villeblevin]]. In his coat pocket was an unused train ticket. He had planned to travel by train with his wife and children, but at the last minute he accepted his publisher's proposal to travel with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm |title=KIAD MA in Fine Art: a student run seminar |publisher=Raimes.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513004641/http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm |archivedate=13 May 2009 }}</ref>\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus' gravestone]]\nThe driver of the [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]] car, {{Interlanguage link multi|Michel Gallimard|fr}}, who was Camus' publisher and close friend, died five days after the accident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bayley|first1=Stephen|title=Albert Camus\u2019 Crash|url=http://www.stephenbayley.com/w/albert-camus-crash|accessdate=5 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233308/http://www.stephenbayley.com/w/albert-camus-crash|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=de Gaudemar |first=Antoine |title= This one's had a good start born in the middle of a move |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1994/apr/16/fiction.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=16 April 1994 |accessdate=21 December 2008}}</ref> In August 2011, the Milan newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus' biographer, {{Interlanguage link multi|Olivier Todd|fr}}, did not consider it credible.<ref>Willsher, Kim, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/07/albert-camus-killed-by-kgb \"Albert Camus might have been killed by the KGB for criticising the Soviet Union, claims newspaper\"], ''The Observer'', 7 August 2011.</ref> Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], Vaucluse, France.\n\nHe was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], at the age of 42.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lennon |first=Peter |title=''Camus and His Women'' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1997/oct/15/biography.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=1 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081207034232/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1997/oct/15/biography.albertcamus| archivedate= 7 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nHe was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work.\n\nTwo of Camus' works were published posthumously. The first, entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'' (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in [[Algeria]].\n\n==Literary career==\nThe first publication of Camus (co-written by Jeanne-Paule Sicard, Yves Bourgeois and Alfred Poignant, and edited by [[Edmond Charlot]]) was Revolte dans les Asturies in May 1936. This concerned a revolt by Spanish miners brutally suppressed by the Spanish government. In May 1937 he wrote his first book ''L\u2019Envers et l\u2019Endroit'' \u2013 dedicated to [[Jean Grenier]] and edited by Charlot.\n \nDuring the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the ''[[pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Beauchard''. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, ''[[The Flies]]'', in June 1943.<ref>''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Prime of Life|fr|3=La Force de l'\u00e2ge}}'', by [[Simone de Beauvoir]].</ref>\n\nWhen [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] [[Liberation of Paris|liberated Paris]] in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombs on Japan]]. He resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the [[Caf\u00e9 de Flore]] on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]], politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] and eventually alienated Sartre.\n\nIn 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays.\n\nCamus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his [[Absurdism|idea of the absurd]]. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Plague]]''. Despite his split from his \"study partner\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an [[Existentialist]]. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \"Enigma\" and elsewhere.<ref>See: ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus''</ref> The current confusion arises, in part, because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus's ''practical'' ideas (see: ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''). But, his personal understanding of the world (e.g., \"a benign indifference\", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress (e.g., vanquishing the \"adolescent furies\" of history and society, in ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'') undoubtedly set him apart.\n\nIn the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953, he criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a workers' strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956, he protested against similar methods in Poland (protests in [[Pozna\u0144]]) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October.\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on December 13, 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment. He was consistent in his call for non-aggression in Algeria (see below).<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/camus-and-algeria-moral-question/ |title=Camus & Algeria: The Moral Question |last=Messud |first=Claire |authorlink=Claire Messud |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |publisher=Rea S.

In 1957, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\".\n\n[[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|left|thumb|\nThe bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris.

His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus' most systematic statement on his views at this time.  In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for ''Alger Republicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands, advocating for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony, again writing a series of article reports on conditions, and advocating for French concessions and reforms to the demands of the Algerian people.\n\nWhen the [[Algerian War]] began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new [[Arab imperialism]]' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'.<ref>''Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes'', 1939\u201358</ref> Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.<ref name=\"Foley2014\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqbCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA161|title=Albert Camus: From the Absurd to Revolt|last=Foley|first=John|date=5 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317492719|page=161|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by [[French left-wing]] intellectuals. At the time of his death, Camus was working on an incomplete novel with a strong biographical component titled ''[[The First Man]].''  The publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus' allegedly unrepentant colonialism in the work of figures such as [[David Carroll (writer)|David Carroll]] in the [[English-speaking world]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11dwG9mnVXsC|title=Albert Camus the Algerian: Colonialism, Terrorism, Justice|last=Carroll|first=David|date=4 May 2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231511766|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\nAs one of the forefathers of existentialism, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life and its inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in the very famous opening of the novel ''The Stranger'' (1942): \"Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.\" This alludes to his claim that life is engrossed by the absurd. He believed that the absurd \u2013 life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist \u2013 was something that man should embrace. He argued that this crisis of self could cause a man to commit \"philosophical suicide\"; choosing to believe in external sources that give life false meaning. He argued that religion was the main culprit. If a man chose to believe in religion \u2013 that the meaning of life was to ascend to heaven, or some similar afterlife, that he committed philosophical suicide by trying to escape the absurd.\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany writers have addressed the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance. For example, [[Sartre]] recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while [[Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally. Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]]. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus' Absurd\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Jerry L.|date=1 August 1972|title=The absurdity of rebellion|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01248640|journal=Man and World|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=335\u2013348|doi=10.1007/bf01248640|issn=0025-1534}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nHis early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between)'' in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''Nuptials''), in 1938. In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Stranger'')]]. In the same year he released ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus''), a literary essay on the Absurd. He also wrote [[Caligula (play)|a play]] about [[Caligula]], a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic. The play was not performed until 1945.\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]''.\n\n===Ideas on the Absurd===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\n{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2011}}\nCamus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality; for Camus, this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In ''Le Mythe'', dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universe's silence. While we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Mythe'', Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=3\u20138}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Le Mythe'', Camus suggests that 'creation of meaning' would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort.<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=21\u201348}}</ref>  But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity have uncovered \u2013 if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more. Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem. He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap. The alternative option, namely suicide, would entail another kind of leap, where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms (the human being). Camus points out, however, that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life, and that it simply evades the problem yet again. Camus concludes that we must instead \"entertain\" both death and the absurd, while never agreeing to their terms.\n\nMeursault, the absurdist hero of ''L'\u00c9tranger,'' has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed. Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=Caligula and Three Other Plays|origyear=1944|year=1958|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>\n\nCamus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. <blockquote>If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning. \u2014 ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.</blockquote>\n\nCamus's understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus, though they are most likely sources of \"relative\" versus \"absolute\" meaning. In ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]],'' Camus identifies rebellion (or rather, the values indicated by rebellion) as a basis for human solidarity. <blockquote>When he rebels, a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself, and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical. But for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains.<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt|year=1956|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=17}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===''The Myth of Sisyphus''===\nDespite his opposition to the label, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Albert Camus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> He wrote, \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.

Camus detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the [[mass politics]] espoused by Sartre in the name of [[Marxism]]. This was apparent in his work ''L'Homme R\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel'') which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics and ideas. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the [[Soviet Union]], a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech ''The Blood of the Hungarians'', commemorating the anniversary of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.\n\n=== Philhellenism, debts to Greek classical thought ===\n[[File:Camus letter appeal.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus appealed to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] for mercy for [[Michalis Karaolis]]]]\n[[File:201703Tassos Papadopoulos2HR.jpg|thumb|right| Cypriot President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] (left) receives from [[Nasos Ktorides]] the letter Camus wrote concerning Karaolis.]]\nOne further important, often neglected component of Camus' philosophical and literary persona was his love of classical Greek thought and literature, or [[philhellenism]].

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie \u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nShe did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"mallowan\"/>{{rp|268}} In contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot - a professional sleuth - would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series\u2014for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|publisher=MTV|work=Artists|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Hannah later released a second Poirot mystery, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}\nChristie's reputation as \"The Queen of Crime\" was built upon the large number of classic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that she introduced, or for which she provided the most famous example. Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (''[[And Then There Were None]]'') or all of the suspects (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'').\n\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of his deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'').<ref name=me>Mezei, Kathy. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330 \"Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll\"], ''The Journal of Modern Literature'' 30.2 (2007): 103\u2013120</ref><ref name=be>Beehler, Sharon A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/818612 \"Close vs. Closed Reading: Interpreting the Clues\"], ''The English Journal'' 77.6 (1998): 39\u201343</ref>\n\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[The Man in the Brown Suit]]'', ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', and ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]''. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot, sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[Dumb Witness]]'', ''[[Crooked House]]'', ''[[The Hollow]]'', ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'', ''[[Cat Among the Pigeons]]'', ''[[Peril at End House]]'', ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', ''[[The Secret Adversary]]'', and ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''. In the last of these (''Curtain''), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\n\nIn ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the [[red herring]] is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the [[Billy Wilder]] film from 1957.) In ''[[Death Comes as the End]]'', set in ancient [[Egypt]], the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim.\n\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' and ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]''. According to [[P. D. James]], Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=P.D.|title=Talking About Detective Fiction|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-307-39882-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGke2wlt0UC&pg=PT26|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn an edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2007, [[Brian Aldiss]] claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.<ref name=\"Brian Aldiss claims Agatha tells method\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4&nbsp;\u2013Factual&nbsp;\u2013Desert Island Discs|last=Aldiss|first=Brian|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211235326/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20070128.shtml |archivedate=11 February 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> However, John Curran's ''Agatha Christie: The Secret Notebooks'' describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Titles====\nChristie's mature novels, from 1940 onwards, often have titles drawn from literature.\n\nFour are from [[Shakespeare]]: \n* ''[[Sad Cypress]]'' from a song in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'': \"Come away, come away, death / And in sad cypress let me be laid\".\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' from Act 4, Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'' : \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes\".\n* ''[[Taken at the Flood|There is a Tide...]]'' (later ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'') from Brutus' speech in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'': \"There is a tide in the affairs of men / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\".\n* ''[[Absent in the Spring]]'' from Sonnet 98: \"From you have I been absent in the spring&nbsp;...\"\n\nThree are from the [[Bible]]: \n* ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:13 (and restated in 6:1): \"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt\".\n* ''[[The Burden]]'' from [[Jesus]]' words: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me&nbsp;...

Its rider was named Death &nbsp;...\".\n\nAnother six are from other works of literature:\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' from [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Lady of Shallot]]\": \"Out flew the web, and floated wide/The mirror cracked from side to side/'The curse is come upon me,\" cried/The Lady of Shalott\"\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' from verse 51 of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]'': \"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ/Moves on&nbsp;...\" This, in turn, refers to the Biblical account of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel, chapter 5), which is the origin of the expression \"the writing on the wall\".\n* ''[[The Rose and the Yew Tree]]'' from Section V of \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" from [[T.

Similarly, the novel [[Mrs McGinty's Dead]] is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the novel.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to [[Italian people|Italians]], Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans, the last usually as impossibly na\u00efve or uninformed. For example, she described \"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the first editions of the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]]'' (1930), in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \"sallow men\" wearing same.\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nOften, she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices. After four years of war-torn London, Christie hoped to return some day to Syria, which she described as \"gentle fertile country and its simple people, who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life; who are idle and gay, and who have dignity, good manners, and a great sense of humour, and to whom death is not terrible.\"<ref name=\"mallowan\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nShe had trouble with an incompetent Swiss French nursery helper (Marcelle) for toddler Rosalind, and as a result she decided, \"Scottish preferred&nbsp;... good with the young. The French were hopeless disciplinarians&nbsp;... Germans good and methodical, but it was not German that I really wanted Rosalind to learn. The Irish were gay but made trouble in the house; the English were of all kinds\".<ref name=\"mallowan\"/>{{rp|327}}\n\n===Non-fiction writings===\nChristie published relatively few non-fiction works:\n*''Come, Tell Me How You Live'', about working on an archaeological dig, drawn from her life with second husband Max Mallowan\n*''The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery'', a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada\n*''[[Agatha Christie: An Autobiography]]'', published posthumously in 1977\n\n===Critical reception and legacy===\nOften referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\" or \"Queen of Mystery\", Agatha Christie is the world's best-selling mystery writer and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.<ref>{{Citation|first1=Dick|last1=Riley|first2=Pam|last2=McAllister|first3=Julian|last3=Symons|title=The Bedside, Bathtub & Armchair Companion to Agatha Christie|page=240|publisher=Continuum|year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|first=Cindy|last=H\u00e4rcher|year=2011|title=The Development of Crime Fiction|page=7|publisher=Grin}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|first=Sandra|last=Engelhardt|title=The Investigators of Crime in Literature|page=83|publisher=Tectum|year=2003}}</ref> Some critics, however, have regarded Christie's plotting as superior to her skill with other literary elements. Novelist [[Raymond Chandler]] criticised her in his essay \"[[The Simple Art of Murder]]\", and American literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] was dismissive of Christie and the detective fiction genre generally in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Wilson|first=Edmund|title=Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=18408&startpage=page0000061#folio=058 | url-access=subscription | magazine=The New Yorker|date=20 January 1945}}</ref>\n\nIn honour of the 125th anniversary of her birth, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher revealed their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors read Christie's novels first, before other [[Mystery fiction|mystery writers]], in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still view her as the \"Queen of Crime\", and creator of the [[plot twist]]s used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries, and find her books good to read now, nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Several of the authors would be very pleased to have their own novels in print in 100 years. Just one of the 25 authors held with Edmund Wilson's views.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/agatha-christie-genius-or-hack-crime-writers-pass-judgment-and-pick-favourites-1.2351699|title=Agatha Christie: genius or hack?

She met her second husband, [[Max Mallowan|Sir Max Mallowan]], a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.{{sfn|Dever|2004|p=162}} Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending 3\u20134 months at a time in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\"/>{{rp|1985}} From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Agatha Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\n===Use of archaeology in her writing===\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them. One such site featured in her work is the temple site of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile'', while many minor characters were archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936) \u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had spent much of her time in very similar situations. The characters in this book in particular are also based on archaeologists whom Christie knew from her personal experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937) \u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938) \u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area. The death itself occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and offers some very descriptive details of sites which Christie herself could have visited in order to write the book.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951) \u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ITV|work=Perspectives|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|date=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) (with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband), and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]. Others, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy by the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dorothy-Agatha-Mystery-Gaylord-Larsen/dp/052524865X|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|url=https://www.amazon.com/London-Blitz-Murders-Allan-Collins/dp/0425198057|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> A fictionalized account of Christie's disappearance is the central theme of a [[Korea]]n musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A young Agatha Christie is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Grand Hotel (TV series)|Grand Hotel]]'' (2011).

the story of a plague sweeping the [[French Algeria]]n city of [[Oran]]. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the [[human condition]]. The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace.\n\nThe novel is believed to be based on the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of Oran's population in 1849 following French colonization, but the novel is placed in the 1940s.<ref>Magill 1989:683</ref> Oran and its environs were struck by disease multiple times before Camus published this novel.  According to a research report by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Oran was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678, but all later outbreaks, in 1921 (185 cases), 1931 (76 cases), and 1944 (95 cases), were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel.\n\n''The Plague'' is considered an [[existentialist]] classic despite Camus' objection to the label.<ref>Camus (in Thody, 1970):345. In an interview on 15 November 1945, Camus said: \"No, I am not an existentialist.\"</ref><ref>Forsdick 2007:119</ref> The narrative tone is similar to [[Franz Kafka|Kafka's]], especially in ''[[The Trial]]'' whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark [[allegory]] of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.\n\nCamus included a dim-witted character misreading ''[[The Trial]]'' as a mystery novel as an oblique [[homage (arts)|homage]]. The novel has been read as a [[allegory|allegorical]] treatment of the [[French resistance]] to [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation during World War II.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/17/albertcamus | title=A hero for our times | work=The Guardian | author=Tony Judt | date=2001-11-16 | accessdate=2016-07-08}}</ref>  Additionally, he further illustrates the human reaction towards the \"absurd\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy | title=Albert Camus' ''The Plague'': a story for our, and all, times | work=The Guardian (Books blog) | author=Ed Vulliamy | date=2015-01-05 | accessdate=2016-07-08}}</ref> ''The Plague'' represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]], a theory that Camus himself helped to define.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*'''The Narrator''': the narrator presents himself at the outset of the book as witness to the events and privy to documents, but does not identify himself with any character until the ending of the novel.\n*'''Asthma Patient''': the asthma patient receives regular visits from Dr. Rieux. He is a seventy-five-year-old Spaniard with a rugged face, who comments on events in Oran that he hears about on the radio and in the newspapers.\n*'''Dr. Castel''': Dr. Castel is one of Rieux's medical colleagues and is much older than Rieux. He realizes after the first few cases that the disease is [[bubonic plague]] and is aware of the seriousness of the situation. He works hard to make an antiplague serum, but as the epidemic continues, he shows increasing signs of wear and tear.\n*'''Cottard''': Cottard lives in the same building as Grand. He does not appear to have a job and is described as having private means although he describes himself as \"a traveling salesman in wines and spirits.\" Cottard is an eccentric figure, silent and secretive, who tries to hang himself in his room. Afterwards, he does not want to be interviewed by the police since he has committed a crime by attempting suicide and fears arrest.<br>Cottard's personality changes after the outbreak of plague. Whereas he was aloof and mistrustful before, he now becomes agreeable and tries hard to make friends. He appears to relish the coming of the plague, and Tarrou thinks it is because he finds it easier to live with his own fears now that everyone else is in a state of fear, too. Cottard takes advantage of the crisis to make money by selling contraband cigarettes and inferior liquor.<br>As the epidemic wanes, Cottard's mood fluctuates. Sometimes he is sociable, but at other times, he shuts himself up in his room. Eventually, he loses his mental balance and shoots at random at people on the street, wounding some and killing a dog. The police arrest him.\n*'''Garcia''': Garcia is a man who knows the group of smugglers in Oran. He introduces Rambert to Raoul.\n*'''Gonzales''': Gonzales is the smuggler who makes the arrangements for Rambert's escape and bonds with him over football.\n*'''Joseph Grand''': Joseph Grand is a fifty-year-old clerk for the city government. He is tall and thin. Poorly paid, he lives an austere life, but he is capable of deep affection. In his spare time, Grand polishes up his Latin, and he is also writing a book, but he is such a perfectionist that he continually rewrites the first sentence and can get no further. One of his problems in life is that he can rarely find the correct words to express what he means. Grand tells Rieux that he married while still in his teens, but overwork and poverty took their toll (Grand did not receive the career advancement that he had been promised), and his wife Jeanne left him. He tried but failed to write a letter to her, and he still grieves for his loss.<br>Grand is a neighbor of Cottard, and it is he who calls Rieux for help, when Cottard tries to commit suicide. When the plague takes a grip on the town, Grand joins the team of volunteers, acting as general secretary, recording all the statistics. Rieux regards him as \"the true embodiment of the quiet courage that inspired the sanitary groups.\" Grand catches the plague himself and asks Rieux to burn his manuscript, but then makes an unexpected recovery. At the end of the novel, Grand says he is much happier; he has written to Jeanne and made a fresh start on his book.\n*'''Louis''': Louis is one of the sentries who take part in the plan for Rambert to escape.\n*'''Marcel''': Marcel, Louis's brother, is also a sentry who is part of the escape plan for Rambert.\n*'''M. Michel''': M. Michel is the concierge of the building in which Rieux lives. An old man, he is the first victim of the plague.\n*'''Jacques Othon''': Jacques Othon is M. Othon's young son. When he contracts the plague, he is the first to receive Dr. Castel's antiplague serum. But the serum is ineffective, and the boy dies after a long and painful struggle.\n*'''M. Othon''': M. Othon is a magistrate in Oran. He is tall and thin and, as Tarrou observes in his journal, \"his small, beady eyes, narrow nose, and hard, straight mouth make him look like a well-brought-up owl.\" Othon treats his wife and children unkindly, but after his son dies of the plague, his character softens. After he finishes his time at the isolation camp, where he is sent because his son is infected, he wants to return there because it would make him feel closer to his lost son. However, before Othon can do this, he contracts the plague and dies.\n*'''Father Paneloux''': Father Paneloux is a learned, well-respected Jesuit priest. He is well known for having given a series of lectures in which he championed a pure form of Christian doctrine and chastised his audience about their laxity. During the first stage of the plague outbreak, Paneloux preaches a sermon at the cathedral. He has a powerful way of speaking, and he insists to the congregation that the plague is a scourge sent by God to those who have hardened their hearts against him. However, Paneloux also claims that God is present to offer succor and hope. Later, Paneloux attends at the bedside of Othon's stricken son and prays that the boy may be spared. After the boy's death, Paneloux tells Rieux that although the death of an innocent child in a world ruled by a loving God cannot be rationally explained, it should nonetheless be accepted. Paneloux joins the team of volunteer workers and preaches another sermon saying that the death of the innocent child is a test of faith. Since God willed the child's death, so the Christian should will it, too. A few days after preaching this sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. He refuses to call for a doctor, trusting in God alone, and dies. Since his symptoms did not seem to resemble those of the plague, Rieux records his death as a \"doubtful case.\"\n*'''The Prefect''': The Prefect believes at first that the talk of plague is a false alarm, but on the advice of his medical association, he authorises limited measures to combat it. When they do not work, he tries to avoid responsibility, saying he will ask the government for orders. Then, he takes responsibility for tightening up the regulations relating to the plague and issues the order to close the town.\n*'''Raymond Rambert''': Raymond Rambert is a journalist who is visiting Oran to research a story on living conditions in the Arab quarter of the town. When the plague strikes, he finds himself trapped in a city with which he feels he has no connection. He misses his wife who is in [[Paris]] and uses all his ingenuity and resourcefulness to persuade the city bureaucracy to allow him to leave. When that fails, he contacts smugglers, who agree to help him escape for a fee of ten thousand francs. However, there is a hitch in the arrangements, and by the time another escape plan is arranged, Rambert has changed his mind. He decides to stay in the city and continue to help fight the plague, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he pursued a merely private happiness. He now feels that he belongs in Oran, and that the plague is everyone's business, including his.\n*'''Raoul''': Raoul is the man who agrees, for a fee of ten thousand francs, to arrange for Rambert to escape. He introduces Rambert to Gonzales.\n*'''Dr. Richard''': Dr. Richard is chairman of the Oran Medical Association. He is slow to recommend any action to combat the plague for fear of public alarm. He does not want even to admit that the disease is the plague, referring instead to a \"special type of fever.\"\n*'''Dr. Bernard Rieux''': Dr. Bernard Rieux is described as a man about age 35, of moderate height, dark-skinned, with close-cropped black hair. At the beginning of the novel, Rieux's wife, who has been ill for a year, leaves for a sanatorium. It is Rieux who treats the first victim of plague and first uses the word plague to describe the disease. He urges the authorities to take action to stop the spread of the epidemic. However, at first, along with everyone else, the danger the town faces seems unreal to him. He feels uneasy but does not realise the gravity of the situation. Within a short while, he grasps what is at stake and warns the authorities that unless steps are taken immediately, the epidemic could kill off half the town's population of two hundred thousand within a couple of months.<br>During the epidemic, Rieux heads an auxiliary hospital and works long hours treating the victims. He injects serum and lances the abscesses, but there is little more that he can do, and his duties weigh heavily upon him. He never gets home until late, and he has to distance himself from the natural pity that he feels for the victims; otherwise, he would not be able to go on. It is especially hard for him when he visits a victim in the person's home because he knows that he must immediately call for an ambulance and have the person removed from the house. Often, the relatives plead with him not to do so since they know they may never see the person again.<br>Rieux works to combat the plague simply because he is a doctor and his job is to relieve human suffering. He does not do it for any grand, religious purpose, like Paneloux (Rieux does not believe in God), or as part of a high-minded moral code, like Tarrou. He is a practical man, doing what needs to be done without any fuss, but he knows that the struggle against death is something that he can never win.\n*'''Mme. Rieux''': Mme. Rieux is Dr. Rieux's mother, who comes to stay with him when his sick wife goes to the sanatorium. She is a serene woman who, after taking care of the housework, sits quietly in a chair. She says that at her age, there is nothing much left to fear.\n*'''Jean Tarrou''': Jean Tarrou arrived in Oran some weeks before the plague broke out for unknown reasons. He is not there on business since he appears to have private means. Tarrou is a good-natured man who smiles a lot. Before the plague came, he liked to associate with the Spanish dancers and musicians in the city. He also keeps a diary, full of his observations of life in Oran, which Rieux incorporates into the narrative.<br>It is Tarrou who first comes up with the idea of organising teams of volunteers to fight the plague. He wants to do so before the authorities begin to conscript people, and he does not like the official plan to get prisoners to do the work. He takes action, prompted by his own code of morals; he feels that the plague is everybody's responsibility and that everyone should do his or her duty. What interests him, he tells Rieux, is how to become a saint even though he does not believe in God.<br>Later in the novel, Tarrou tells Rieux, with whom he has become friends, the story of his life. His father, although a kind man in private, was also an aggressive prosecuting attorney who tried death penalty cases, arguing strongly for the death penalty to be imposed. As a young boy, Tarrou attended one day of a criminal proceeding in which a man was on trial for his life. However, the idea of capital punishment disgusted him. After he left home before 18, his main interest in life was his opposition to the death penalty, which he regarded as state-sponsored murder. However, years of activism, and fighting for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side of the [[Spanish Civil War]] have left him disillusioned.<br>When the plague epidemic is virtually over, Tarrou becomes one of its last victims but puts up a heroic struggle before dying.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe text of ''The Plague'' is divided into five parts.\n\n===Part one===\n[[File:Library Walk 5.JPG|thumb|\"... Dr Rieux resolved to compile this chronicle ...\"]]\nIn the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets. Hysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident. Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the [[bubonic plague]].\n\nThe main character, Dr. Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Dr. Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town. They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death. However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic. Meanwhile, Rieux's wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city, to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness.\n\nAuthorities, including the Prefect, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take.  Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation. A \"special ward\" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days. As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken. Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised. A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is enough to treat only existing cases, and the country's emergency reserves are depleted. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed, and an outbreak of plague is officially declared.\n\n===Part two===\nThe town is sealed off. The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended. The use of telephone lines is restricted only to \"urgent\" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town. The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters.\n\nOne character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in Paris after city officials refused his request to leave.  He befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city.  Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances. Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler. Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer; Joseph Grand, a civil engineer; and Jean Tarrou, exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital.\n\nRambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that there are others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind. He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic.\n\n===Part three===\nIn mid-August, the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation. Despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically.\n\n===Part four===\nIn September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Eurydice]]'', but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance.\n\nAfter extended negotiations with guards, Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left.\n\nTowards the end of October, Castel's new antiplague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou tend to his bedside in horror.\n\nPaneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague.\n\nA few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal.\n\nTarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life and, to take their mind off the epidemic, the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. However, Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline.\n\n===Part five===\nBy late January the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him, and he flees. Despite the epidemic's ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle. Rieux is later informed via telegram that his wife has also died.\n\nIn February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities. Rambert is reunited with his wife. Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home. He is arrested. Grand begins working on his novel again. The narrator of the chronicle reveals his identity and states and that he tried to present an objective view of the events. The narrator reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.\n\n==Critical analysis==\nGermaine Br\u00e9e has characterised the struggle of the characters against the plague as \"undramatic and stubborn\", and in contrast to the ideology of \"glorification of power\" in the novels of [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], whereas Camus' characters \"are obscurely engaged in saving, not destroying, and this in the name of no ideology\".<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=2929136 | last=Sterling | first=Elwyn F | title=Albert Camus and the Plague | journal=Yale French Studies | volume=8 | issue= | pages=93\u2013100 | date=1951 }}</ref>  Lulu Haroutunian has discussed Camus' own medical history, including a bout with tuberculosis, and how it informs the novel.<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=3042843 | last=Haroutunian | first=Lulu M | title=Albert Camus and the White Plague | journal=MLN | volume=79 | issue=3 | pages=311\u2013315 | date=May 1964 }}</ref> [[Marina Warner]] has noted the lack of female characters and the total absence of Arab characters in the novel, but also notes its larger philosophical themes of \"engagement\", \"paltriness and generosity\", \"small heroism and large cowardice\", and \"all kinds of profoundly humanist problems, such as love and goodness, happiness and mutual connection\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/classics.albertcamus | title=To be a man | work=The Guardian | author=Marina Warner | date=2003-04-26 | accessdate=2016-07-08}}</ref>\n\nThomas L Hanna and John Loose have separately discussed themes related to Christianity in the novel, with particular respect to Father Paneloux and Dr Rieux.<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=1201083 | last=Hanna | first=Thomas L | title=Albert Camus and the Christian Faith | journal=The Journal of Religion | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=224\u2013233 | date=October 1956 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | jstor=1201321 | last=Loose | first=John | title=The Christian as Camus's Absurd Man | journal=The Journal of Religion | volume=42 | issue=3 | pages=203\u2013214 | date=July 1962 }}</ref>  Louis R Rossi briefly discusses the role of Tarrou in the novel, and the sense of philosophical guilt behind his character.<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=4333870 | last=Rossi | first=Louis R | title=Albert Camus: The Plague of Absurdity | journal=The Kenyon Review | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=399\u2013422 | date=Summer 1958 }}</ref>  Elwyn Sterling has analysed the role of Cottard and his final actions at the end of the novel.<ref>{{cite journal | jstor=25111699 | last=Sterling | first=Elwyn F | title=Albert Camus' \"La Peste\": Cottard's Act of Madness | journal=College Literature | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=189\u2013209 | date=Spring 1986 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nAs early as April 1941, Camus had been working on the novel, as evidenced in his diaries in which he wrote down a few ideas on \"the redeeming plague\".<ref>Camus, Albert, ''Carnets I, Mai 1935 - f\u00e9vrier 1942'', Paris, Gallimard, 2013, 234 p.

Retrieved June 25, 2017.</ref>\n__NOTOC__\n\n==Modern approach==\nMuch of applied ethics is concerned with three theories:\n\n# [[Utilitarianism]], where the practical consequences of various policies are evaluated on the assumption that the right policy will be the one which results in the greatest happiness. This theory's main developments came from [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. Later developments have also adjusted the theory, most notably [[Henry Sidgwick]] who introduced the idea of [[motive (law)|motive]] or [[intent]] in morality, and [[Peter Singer]] who introduced the idea of [[preference]] in moral decision making. \n# [[Deontological ethics]], notions based on 'rules' i.e. that there is an obligation to perform the 'right' action, regardless of actual consequences (epitomized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s notion of the [[Categorical Imperative]] which was the centre to Kant's ethical theory based on [[duty]]). Another key deontological theory is [[Natural Law]], which was heavily developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and is an important part of the [[Catholic Church]]'s teaching on Morals. \n# [[Virtue ethics]], derived from Aristotle's and Confucius's notions, which asserts that the right action will be that chosen by a suitably 'virtuous' agent.\n\nOne modern approach which attempts to overcome the seemingly impossible divide between deontology and utilitarianism (of which the divide is caused by the opposite takings of an [[absolute morality|absolute]] and [[Moral relativism|relativist]] moral view) is [[case-based reasoning]], also known as [[casuistry]].  Casuistry does not begin with theory, rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case.  While casuistry makes use of ethical theory, it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning.  Casuists, like Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Abuse of Casuistry'' 1988), challenge the traditional [[paradigm]] of applied ethics.  Instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case, casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features (including both theory and practical considerations) ought to be considered for that particular case.  In their observations of medical ethics committees, Jonsen and Toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case, rather than on [[ideology]] or [[theory]].  Thus, a Rabbi, a Catholic priest, and an agnostic might agree that, in this particular case, the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care, while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions.  By focusing on cases and not on theory, those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Effective altruism]]\n*[[Ethical code]]s\n*[[Ethics]]\n*[[Medical ethics]]\n*[[Bioethics]]\n*[[Business ethics]]\n*[[Outline of ethics]]\n*[[Philosophy]]\n*[[Precautionary principle]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n<references/>\n* {{Cite book| first=R.F. | last=Chadwick | year=1997 | title=Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | location=London | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=0-12-227065-7  | url= | authorlink= }}\n* {{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Singer | year=1993 | title=[[Practical Ethics]] | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-43971-X | url= | authorlink= }} (monograph)\n* {{Cite book| first=Andrew I. | last=Cohen | year=2005 | title=Contemporary Debates in Applied Ethics | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | isbn=978-1-4051-1548-3 | url= | authorlink= }}\n* {{Cite book| first=Hugh | last=LaFollette | year=2002 | title=Ethics in Practice (2nd Edition) | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Blackwell Publishing| isbn=0-631-22834-9 | url= | authorlink= }}\n* {{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Singer | year=1986 | title=Applied Ethics | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-875067-6 | url= | authorlink= }}\n* {{Cite book| first=R.G. | last=Frey | year=2004 | title=A Companion to Applied Ethics | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Blackwell | isbn=1-4051-3345-7 | url= | authorlink= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* Standard Bibliography PhilPapers [https://philpapers.org/browse/applied-ethics]\n* Chris Young, [http://www.chrisyoung.net/writings/how-to-teach-intro-to-applied-ethics.html How to teach an introduction to applied ethics]\n* [http://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/aapae/ Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics]\n* [http://www.bioethicsinstitute.org Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins Institute]\n* [http://www.ccepa.ca/ Canadian Centre for Ethics in Public Affairs]\n* [http://www.etica-aplicata.ro Centre for Advanced Research in Management and Applied Ethics]\n* [https://www.practicalbioethics.org Center for Practical Bioethics]\n* [http://www.crb.uu.se/ Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics]\n* [http://macleanethics.uchicago.edu MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]\n* [http://www.scu.edu/ethics Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University]\n* [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca W.

Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = \u2212''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|\u2212''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of \u22123 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.\n\nGeneralisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example, an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.\n\n==Terminology and notation==\nIn 1806, [[Jean-Robert Argand]] introduced the term ''module'', meaning ''unit of measure'' in French, specifically for the ''complex'' absolute value,<ref name=oed>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, June 2008</ref><ref>Nahin, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html O'Connor and Robertson], and [http://functions.wolfram.com/ComplexComponents/Abs/35/ functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see [[Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise (Littr\u00e9)|Littr\u00e9]], 1877</ref> and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent ''modulus''.<ref name=oed /> The term ''absolute value'' has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in French<ref>[[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot|Lazare Nicolas M. Carnot]], ''M\u00e9moire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace'', p.&nbsp;105 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA105 at Google Books]</ref> and 1857 in English.<ref>James Mill Peirce, ''A Text-book of Analytic Geometry'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJALAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42 at Google Books].  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term ''absolute value'' is also used in contrast to ''relative value''.</ref> The notation {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}}, with a [[vertical bar]] on each side, was introduced by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in 1841.<ref>Nicholas J. Higham, ''Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences'', SIAM. {{ISBN|0-89871-420-6}}, p.&nbsp;25</ref> Other names for ''absolute value'' include ''numerical value''<ref name=oed /> and ''magnitude''.<ref name=oed />  In programming languages and computational software packages, the absolute value of ''x'' is generally represented by abs(''x''), or a similar expression.\n\nThe vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts: for example, when applied to a set, it denotes its [[cardinality]]; when applied to a matrix, it denotes its [[Determinant of a matrix|determinant]].  Vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined, notably an element of a [[normed division algebra]] like a real number, complex number, quaternion.  A closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the [[euclidean norm]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=Michael|publisher=Westview|year=1965|isbn=0805390219|location=Boulder, CO|pages=1|quote=|via=}}</ref> or [[sup norm]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Analysis on Manifolds|last=Munkres|first=James|publisher=Westview|year=1991|isbn=0201510359|location=Boulder, CO|pages=4|quote=|via=}}</ref> of a vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, although double vertical bars with subscripts (<math>||\\cdot||_2</math> and <math>||\\cdot||_\\infty</math>, respectively) are a more common and less ambiguous notation.\n\n==Definition and properties==\n\n===Real numbers===\nFor any [[real number]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is denoted by {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} (a [[vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as<ref>Mendelson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A8hAm38zsCMC&pg=PA2 p.&nbsp;2].</ref>\n\n:<math>|x| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     x, & \\text{if }  x \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -x, & \\text{if } x < 0.\n   \\end{array}\\right.\n </math>\n\nThe absolute value of&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is thus always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0|zero]], but never [[negative number|negative]]: when {{mvar|x}} itself is negative ({{math|''x'' < 0}}), then its absolute value is necessarily positive ({{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}} {{=}} \u2212''x'' > 0}}).\n\nFrom an [[analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[distance]] from zero along the [[real number line]], and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed, the notion of an abstract [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference (see [[#Distance|\"Distance\"]] below).\n\nSince the [[radical symbol|square root symbol]] represents the unique ''positive'' square root (when applied to a positive number), it follows that\n\n:<math>|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}</math>\n\nis equivalent to the definition above, and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Stewart, James B. | coauthors= | title=Calculus: concepts and contexts | year=2001 | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Australia  | isbn=0-534-37718-1 | pages=}}, p.&nbsp;A5</ref>\n\nThe absolute value has the following four fundamental properties (''a'', ''b'' are real numbers), that are used for generalization of this notion to other domains:\n\n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"width: 250px\" |<math>|a| \\ge 0 </math>\n| Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>|a| = 0 \\iff a = 0 </math>\n|Positive-definiteness\n|-\n|<math>|ab| = |a|\\,|b|</math>\n|[[Multiplicativeness|Multiplicativity]]\n|-\n|<math>|a+b|  \\le |a| + |b|  </math>\n| [[Subadditivity]], specifically the [[triangle inequality]]\n|}\n\nNon-negativity, positive definiteness, and multiplicativity are readily apparent from the definition.  To see that subadditivity holds, first note that one of the two alternatives of taking {{mvar|s}} as either {{math|\u20131}} or {{math|+1}} guarantees that <math>s \\cdot (a+b) = |a+b| \\geq 0.</math> Now, since <math>-1 \\cdot x \\le |x|</math> and <math>+1 \\cdot x \\le |x|</math>, it follows that, whichever is the value of {{mvar|s}}, one has <math>s \\cdot x\\leq |x|</math> for all real <math>x</math>. Consequently, <math>|a+b|=s \\cdot (a+b) = s \\cdot a + s \\cdot b \\leq |a| + |b|</math>, as desired.  (For a generalization of this argument to complex numbers, see [[Absolute value#Proof of the complex triangle inequality|\"Proof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers\"]] below.)\n\nSome additional useful properties are given below.  These are either immediate consequences of the definition or implied by the four fundamental properties above.\n\n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:250px\" |<math>\\big|\\,|a|\\,\\big| = |a|</math> \n|[[Idempotence]] (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value)\n|-\n| style=\"width:250px\" |<math>|-a| = |a|</math>\n|[[even function|Evenness]] ([[reflection symmetry]] of the graph)\n|-\n|<math>|a - b| = 0 \\iff a = b </math>\n|[[Identity of indiscernibles]] (equivalent to positive-definiteness)\n|-\n|<math>|a - b|  \\le |a - c| + |c - b|  </math>\n|[[Triangle inequality#Example norms|Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)\n|-\n|<math>\\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right| = \\frac{|a|}{|b|}\\ </math> (if <math>b \\ne 0</math>)\n|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativity)\n|-\n|<math>|a-b| \\geq \\big|\\,|a| - |b|\\,\\big| </math>\n|[[Reverse triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)\n|}\n\nTwo other useful properties concerning inequalities are:\n:<math>|a| \\le b \\iff -b \\le a \\le b </math>\n:<math>|a| \\ge b \\iff a \\le -b\\ </math> or <math>a\\ge b </math>\n\nThese relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:\n\n:{|\n|-\n|<math>|x-3| \\le 9 </math>\n|<math>\\iff -9 \\le x-3 \\le 9 </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>\\iff -6 \\le x \\le 12 </math>\n|}\n\nThe absolute value, as \"distance from zero\", is used to define the [[absolute difference]] between arbitrary real numbers, the standard [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the real numbers.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Anchor|complex modulus}}[[Image:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number&nbsp;<math>z</math> is the distance&nbsp;<math>r</math> of <math>z</math> from the origin.

However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalised. The absolute value of a complex number is defined by the Euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the [[complex plane]] from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]].  This can be computed using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]: for any complex number\n\n:<math>z = x + iy,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&nbsp;{{mvar|z}} is denoted {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} and is defined by<ref>{{cite book|author=Gonz\u00e1lez, Mario O.|title=Classical Complex Analysis|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|isbn=9780824784157|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncxL7EFr7GsC&pg=PA19}}</ref>\n\n:<math>|z| =  \\sqrt{[\\mathrm{Re}(z)]^2 + [\\mathrm{Im}(z)]^2}=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2},</math>\n\nwhere Re(''z'') = ''x'' and Im(''z'') = ''y'' denote the real and imaginary parts of ''z'', respectively.

It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for {{mvar|x}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval {{open-closed|\u2212\u221e,0}} and monotonically increasing on the interval {{closed-open|0,+\u221e}}. Since a real number and its [[additive inverse|opposite]] have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[Inverse function|invertible]]. The real absolute value function is a [[piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]], [[convex function]].\n\nBoth the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].\n\n===Relationship to the sign function===\nThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the [[sign function|sign (or signum) function]] returns a number's sign irrespective of its value.

This is not a [[complex antiderivative]] because complex antiderivatives can only exist for complex-differentiable ([[holomorphic]]) functions, which the complex absolute value function is not.\n\n==Distance==\n{{see also|Metric space}}\nThe absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.\n\nThe standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points\n\n:<math>a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_n) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_n) </math>\n\nin [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space]] is defined as:\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}. </math>\n\nThis can be seen as a generalisation, since for <math>a_1</math> and <math>b_1</math> real, i.e. in a 1-space, according to the alternative definition of the absolute value,\n\n:<math>|a_1 - b_1| = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^1(a_i-b_i)^2},</math>\n\nand for <math> a = a_1 + i a_2 </math> and <math> b = b_1 + i b_2 </math> complex numbers, i.e. in a 2-space,\n \n:{|\n|-\n|<math>|a - b| </math>\n|<math> = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^2(a_i-b_i)^2}.</math>\n|}\n\nThe above shows that the \"absolute value\"-distance, for real and complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance, which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, respectively.\n\nThe properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:\n\nA real valued function {{mvar|d}} on a set {{math|''X''\u2009\u00d7\u2009''X''}} is called a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (or a ''distance function'') on&nbsp;{{mvar|X}}, if it satisfies the following four axioms:<ref>These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: {{math|1=0 = ''d''(''a'',\u2009''a'') \u2264 ''d''(''a'',\u2009''b'') + ''d''(''b'',\u2009''a'') = 2''d''(''a'',\u2009''b'')}}.</ref>\n:{|\n|-\n|style=\"width:250px\" | <math>d(a, b) \\ge 0 </math>\n|Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b) = 0 \\iff a = b </math>\n|Identity of indiscernibles\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b) = d(b, a) </math>\n|Symmetry\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b)  \\le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  </math>\n|Triangle inequality\n|}\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Ordered rings===\nThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any [[ordered ring]].

This meaning of ''valuation'' is rare.

It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativity that {{math|1=''v''('''1''') = 1}}, where '''1''' denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] element of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.\n\nIf {{mvar|v}} is an absolute value on&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, then the function&nbsp;{{mvar|d}} on {{math|''F''\u2009\u00d7\u2009''F''}}, defined by {{math|1=''d''(''a'',\u2009''b'') = ''v''(''a'' \u2212 ''b'')}}, is a metric and the following are equivalent:\n\n* {{mvar|d}} satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality <math>d(x, y) \\leq \\max(d(x,z),d(y,z))</math> for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}.\n* <math> \\big\\{ v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big\\} </math> is [[bounded set|bounded]] in&nbsp;'''R'''.\n* <math> v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) \\le 1\\ </math> for every <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}.</math>\n* <math> v(a) \\le 1 \\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\le 1\\ </math> for all <math>a \\in F.</math>\n* <math> v(a + b) \\le \\mathrm{max}\\{v(a), v(b)\\}\\ </math> for all <math>a, b \\in F.</math>\n\nAn absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].<ref>Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&pg=PA260 pp.&nbsp;260\u2013261].</ref>\n\n===Vector spaces===\n{{Main|Norm (mathematics)}}\nAgain the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.\n\nA real-valued function on a [[vector space]]&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} over a field&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, represented as <big>{{math|\u2016\u00b7<!-- do not replace with \u22c5: not a multiplication sign! -->\u2016}}</big>, is called an '''absolute value''', but more usually a [[Norm (mathematics)|'''norm''']], if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\nFor all&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, and {{math|'''v'''}}, {{math|'''u'''}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|V}},\n\n:{| cellpadding=10\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|  \\ge 0 </math>\n|Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 0 \\iff \\mathbf{v} = 0</math>\n|Positive-definiteness\n|-\n|<math>\\|a \\mathbf{v}\\| = |a| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| </math>\n|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u}\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| + \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| </math>\n|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality\n|}\n\nThe norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.\n\nIn the case of [[Euclidean space]]&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the function defined by\n\n:<math>\\|(x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) \\| = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}</math>\n\nis a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''}} are considered as the one-dimensional vector space&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the {{mvar|p}}-norm (see [[L^p space#Definition|L<sup>p</sup> space]]) for any&nbsp;{{mvar|p}}. In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on {{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, in the sense that, for every norm {{math|\u2016\u00b7\u2016}} on&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, {{math|1=\u2016''x''\u2016 = \u20161\u2016\u2009\u22c5\u2009{{!}}''x''{{!}}}}. The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]]&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n===Composition algebras===\n{{main|Composition algebra}}\nEvery composition algebra ''A'' has an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''x'' \u2192 ''x''* called its '''conjugation'''. The product in ''A'' of an element ''x'' and its conjugate ''x''* is written ''N''(''x'') = ''x x''* and called the '''norm of x'''.\n\nThe real numbers \u211d, complex numbers \u2102, and quaternions \u210d are all composition algebras with norms given by [[definite quadratic form]]s. The absolute value in these [[division algebra]]s is given by the [[square root]] of the composition algebra norm.\n\nIn general the norm of a composition algebra may be a [[quadratic form]] that is not definite and has [[null vector]]s. However, as in the case of division algebras, when an element ''x'' has a non-zero norm, then ''x'' has a [[multiplicative inverse]] given by ''x''*/''N''(''x'').\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Bartle; Sherbert; ''Introduction to real analysis'' (4th ed.), John Wiley & Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-471-43331-6}}.\n* Nahin, Paul J.; ''An Imaginary Tale''; Princeton University Press; (hardcover, 1998). {{ISBN|0-691-02795-1}}.\n* Mac Lane, Saunders, Garrett Birkhoff, ''Algebra'', American Mathematical Soc., 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8218-1646-2}}.\n* Mendelson, Elliott, ''Schaum's Outline of Beginning Calculus'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-07-148754-2}}.\n* O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.; [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html \"Jean Robert Argand\"].\n* Schechter, Eric; ''Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations'', pp.&nbsp;259\u2013263, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&pg=PA259 \"Absolute Values\"],  Academic Press (1997) {{ISBN|0-12-622760-8}}.\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Absolute value|id=p/a010370}}\n* {{PlanetMath | urlname=AbsoluteValue | title=absolute value | id=448}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=AbsoluteValue | title=Absolute Value}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Absolute Value}}\n[[Category:Special functions]]\n[[Category:Real numbers]]\n[[Category:Norms (mathematics)]]", "sha1": "2ti97eoexnc2bhnhxqd7zueujtg01z8"}}, {"title": "Analog signal", "ns": "0", "id": "993", "revision": {"id": "866446592", "parentid": "866446570", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T11:38:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/Davaadorj_lkhagvasuren|Davaadorj_lkhagvasuren]] ([[User talk:Davaadorj_lkhagvasuren|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Use American English|date=July 2018}}\n{{Broader|Signal}}\n\n{{refimprove|date=September 2015}}\n\nAn '''analog signal'''  is any [[continuous signal]] for which the time-varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., ''analogous'' to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog [[audio signal]], the instantaneous [[voltage]] of the signal varies continuously with the [[Sound pressure|pressure]] of the sound waves. It differs from a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]], in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete values]] which can only take on one of a finite number of values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|title=Digital signals|publisher=University of St. Andrews |author=Jim Lesurf |access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|title=Analog vs. Digital|publisher=Sparkfun |date=2018-02-18}}</ref>  The term ''analog signal'' usually refers to [[electrical signal]]s; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.\n\n==Representation==\nAn analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information.  In an electrical signal, the [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], or [[frequency]] of the signal may be varied to represent the information.\n   \nAny information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often{{specify|date=July 2018}} such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], position, or [[pressure]].  The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a [[transducer]].   For example, [[sound]] striking the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a [[condenser microphone]].  The voltage or the current is said to be an \"analog\" of the sound.\n \n==Noise==\n{{See also|Comparison of analog and digital recording}}\nAn analog signal is subject to [[Noise (electronic)|electronic noise]] and [[distortion]] introduced by [[communication channel]]s and [[signal processing]] operations, which can progressively degrade the [[Signal-to-noise ratio|signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]].  In contrast, digital signals have a finite resolution.  Converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low-level [[quantization noise]] into the signal which determines the noise floor, but once in digital form the signal can be processed or transmitted without introducing additional noise or distortion. In analog systems, it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs.  However, in digital systems, degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well.\n\nThe most serious disadvantage of analog signals compared to digital transmission is that analog transmissions always contain [[Noise (physics)|noise]]. As the signal is copied, transmitted, or processed, the unavoidable noise introduced in the signal path will accumulate as a [[generation loss]], progressively and irreversibly degrading the [[signal-to-noise ratio]], until in extreme cases the signal can be overwhelmed. Noise can show up as \"hiss\" and [[intermodulation distortion]] in audio signals, or \"snow\" in video signals. Generation loss is irreversible as there is no reliable method to distinguish the noise from the signal, partly because amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well. Digital signals can be transmitted, stored and processed without introducing noise. \n\nIn electrical analog signals, noise can be minimized by shielding, good connections and the use of certain cable types such as [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] or [[twisted pair]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Analog audio]]\n* [[Analog computer]]\n* [[Analog device]]\n* [[Analog signal processing]]\n* [[Analog video]]\n* [[Analog-to-digital converter]]\n* [[Digital audio]]\n* [[Digital video]]\n* [[Magnetic tape]]\n* [[Video tape]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Analog Signal}}\n[[Category:Analog circuits]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Video signal]]", "sha1": "dcip6f7jq28deklmwef554g6goe57u1"}}, {"title": "Arecales", "ns": "0", "id": "994", "revision": {"id": "825897623", "parentid": "808787232", "timestamp": "2018-02-16T01:49:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[Template talk:Taxonbar#from1|Add from]]=[[d:Special:EntityPage/Q1096533|Q1096533]] to {{[[Template:Taxonbar|Taxonbar]]}}; [[WP:GenFixes]] on, using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| taxon = Arecales\n| image = Beetle palm with nut bunch.jpg\n| image_caption = ''[[Areca catechu]]''\n| fossil_range = {{fossil range|80|0}}[[Late Cretaceous]] - Recent\n| authority = [[Edward Ffrench Bromhead|Bromhead]]\n| subdivision_ranks = Families\n| subdivision = \n*[[Arecaceae]]\n*[[Dasypogonaceae]]\n| diversity = \n206 genera\n}}\n\n'''Arecales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s.

Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, appearing in 33 [[novels]], one play (''[[Black Coffee (play)|Black Coffee]]''), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975.\n\nPoirot has been portrayed on radio, in film and on television by various actors, including [[Austin Trevor]], [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Tony Randall]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Orson Welles]], [[David Suchet]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[John Malkovich]].\n{{toclimit}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\n=== Influences ===\n\nPoirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]]' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans' Monsieur Poiret, a retired Belgian police officer living in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5054 |title=Agatha Christie (1890\u20131976) |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |first=Chris|last= Willis|location=London Metropolitan University}}</ref>\n\nA more obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. In ''An Autobiography'', Christie states, \"I was still writing in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] tradition \u2013 eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a [[Inspector Lestrade|Lestrade]]-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp\".<ref>Reproduced as the \"Introduction\" to {{harvnb|Christie|2013}}</ref> For his part, Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[C. Auguste Dupin]] and his anonymous narrator, and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on [[Joseph Bell]], who in his use of \"[[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]]\" prefigured Poirot's reliance on his \"little grey cells\".\n\nPoirot also bears a striking resemblance to [[A. E. W. Mason]]'s fictional detective, [[Inspector Hanaud]] of the French [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]], who first appeared in the 1910 novel ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'' and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years.\n\nUnlike the models mentioned above, Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. His Belgian nationality was interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany, which also provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be out of work and available to solve mysteries at an [[English country house]].{{sfn|Christie|1939}} At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians,<ref>{{cite book|author=Horace Cornelius Peterson|title=Propaganda for War.

Following the latter, Poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot/ |title=Poirot |publisher=Official Agatha Christie website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412131601/http://uk.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot/ |archivedate=12 April 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hercule Poirot is Dead; Famed Belgian Detective; Hercule Poirot, the Detective, Dies |first=Thomas |last=Lask |date=6 August 1975 |page=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E10F63A5E157493C4A91783D85F418785F9}}</ref>\n\nBy 1930, Agatha Christie found Poirot \"insufferable\", and, by 1960, she felt that he was a \"detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep\". Yet the public loved him and Christie refused to kill him off, claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5054 |title=Agatha Christie (1890\u20131976) |date=16 July 2001 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |first=Chris |last=Willis |work=The Literary Encyclopedia |publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company |issn=1747-678X}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and proclivities ===\n\n[[Captain Arthur Hastings]]'s first description of Poirot:\n\n{{quote|He was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.\n\nThe neatness of his attire was almost incredible; I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.{{sfn|Christie|1939}}}}\n\nAgatha Christie's initial description of Poirot in ''The Murder on the Orient Express'':\n\n<blockquote>By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform, conversing with a small man [Hercule Poirot] muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache.{{sfn|Christie|2011}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the later books, his limp is not mentioned, suggesting it may have been a temporary wartime injury. (In ''[[Curtain: Poirot's Last Case|Curtain]]'', Poirot admits he was wounded when he first came to England.) Poirot has green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining \"like a cat's\" when he is struck by a clever idea,<ref>E.g. \"For about ten minutes [Poirot] sat in dead silence ... and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener\" {{harvnb|Christie|1939|loc=Chapter 5}}</ref> and dark hair, which he dyes later in life. In ''Curtain'', he admits to Hastings that he wears a wig and a false moustache.<ref>as Hastings discovers in {{harvnb|Christie|1991|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> However, in many of his screen incarnations, he is bald or balding.\n\nFrequent mention is made of his [[patent leather]] shoes, damage to which is frequently a source of misery for him, but comical for the reader.<ref>E.g. \"Hercule Poirot looked down at the tips of his patent-leather shoes and sighed.\" {{harvnb|Christie|1947a}}</ref> Poirot's appearance, regarded as fastidious during his early career, later falls hopelessly out of fashion.<ref>E.g. \"And now here was the man himself. Really a most impossible person \u2013 the wrong clothes \u2013 button boots! an incredible moustache! Not his \u2013 Meredith Blake's kind of fellow at all.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011|loc=Chapter 7}}</ref> He employs [[pince-nez]] reading glasses.\n\nAmong Poirot's most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach:\n\n<blockquote>The plane dropped slightly. ''\"Mon estomac,\"'' thought Hercule Poirot, and closed his eyes determinedly.{{sfn|Christie|2010|loc=Chapter 1}}</blockquote>\n\nHe suffers from [[sea sickness]],<ref>\"My stomach, it is not happy on the sea\"{{harvnb|Christie|1980|loc=Chapter 8, iv}}</ref> and, in ''Death in the Clouds'', he states that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder. Later in his life, we are told:\n\n<blockquote>Always a man who had taken his stomach seriously, he was reaping his reward in old age. Eating was not only a physical pleasure, it was also an intellectual research.{{sfn|Christie|2010|loc=Chapter 1}}</blockquote>\n\nPoirot is extremely punctual and carries a [[pocket watch]] almost to the end of his career.<ref>\"he walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell, glancing as he did so at the neat wrist-watch which had at last replaced an old favourite \u2013 the large turnip-faced watch of early days. Yes, it was exactly nine-thirty. As ever, Hercule Poirot was exact to the minute.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011b}}</ref> He is also particular about his personal finances, preferring to keep a bank balance of 444&nbsp;pounds, 4 shillings, and 4 pence.{{sfn|Christie|2013a}} Actor [[David Suchet]], who portrayed Poirot on television, said \"there's no question he's [[obsessive-compulsive]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/19/david-suchet-poirot-agatha-christie|title=Laura Barton meets David Suchet, star of Agatha Christie's Poirot|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=2009-05-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Film portrayer [[Kenneth Branagh]] said that he \"enjoyed finding the sort of obsessive-compulsive\" in Poirot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/10/563378736/kenneth-branagh-on-his-meticulous-master-detective-role-in-murder-on-the-orient-|title=Kenneth Branagh On His Meticulous Master Detective Role In 'Murder On The Orient Express'|publisher=NPR |access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs mentioned in ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'' and ''[[The Clocks]]'', he is fond of classical music, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]].\n\n=== Methods ===\n\nIn ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', Poirot operates as a fairly conventional, clue-based and logical detective; reflected in his vocabulary by two common phrases: his use of \"[[Grey matter|the little grey cells]]\" and \"order and method\". Hastings is irritated by the fact that Poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans, as in ''The Big Four''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}} In this novel, Hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax. This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead.\n\nIn ''Murder on the Links,'' still largely dependent on clues himself, Poirot mocks a rival \"bloodhound\" detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction (e.g., Sherlock Holmes depending on [[footprints]], [[fingerprint]]s, and cigar ash). From this point on, Poirot establishes his psychological bona fides. Rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes, he enquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer. He predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people.\n\nPoirot focuses on getting people to talk. In the early novels, he casts himself in the role of \"Papa Poirot\", a benign confessor, especially to young women. In later works, Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information.<ref>\"It has been said of Hercule Poirot by some of his friends and associates, at moments when he has maddened them most, that he prefers lies to truth and will go out of his way to gain his ends by elaborate false statements, rather than trust to the simple truth.\" {{harvnb|Christie|2011b|loc= Book One, Chapter 9}}</ref> In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot speaks of a non-existent mentally disabled nephew<ref>E.g. \"After a careful study of the goods displayed in the window, Poirot entered and represented himself as desirous of purchasing a rucksack for a hypothetical nephew.\" ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', Chapter 13</ref> to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit. In ''Dumb Witness'', Poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as a pretence to investigate local nurses. In ''The Big Four'', Poirot pretends to have (and poses as) an identical twin brother named Achille: however, this brother was mentioned again in ''The Labours of Hercules''.{{sfn|Christie|2004b}}\n\n<blockquote>To this day Harold is not quite sure what made him suddenly pour out the whole story to a little man to whom he had only spoken a few minutes before.{{sfn|Christie|1947b}}</blockquote>\n\nPoirot is also willing to appear more foreign or vain in an effort to make people underestimate him. He admits as much:\n\n<blockquote>It is true that I can speak the exact, the idiomatic English. But, my friend, to speak the broken English is an enormous asset. It leads people to despise you. They say \u2013 a foreigner \u2013 he can't even speak English properly. ... Also I boast! An Englishman he says often, \"A fellow who thinks as much of himself as that cannot be worth much.\" ... And so, you see, I put people off their guard.{{sfn|Christie|2006b|loc=final chapter}}</blockquote>\n\nIn later novels, Christie often uses the word ''mountebank'' when characters describe Poirot, showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a [[charlatan]] or fraud.\n\nPoirot's investigating techniques assist him solving cases; \"For in the long run, either through a lie, or through truth, people were bound to give themselves away...\"{{sfn|Christie|2005|loc=Chapter 18}} At the end, Poirot usually reveals his description of the sequence of events and his deductions to a room of suspects, often leading to the culprit's apprehension.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:2011-07-26 Belgique - Ellezelles - Hercule Poirot 002.jpg|thumb|230px|Statuette of Poirot in [[Ellezelles]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nChristie was purposely vague about Poirot's origins, as he is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In ''An Autobiography,'' she admitted that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.\n\nA brief passage in ''The Big Four'' provides original information about Poirot's birth or at least childhood in or near the town of [[Spa, Belgium]]: \"But we did not go into Spa itself. We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills, till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the hillside.\"{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 16}} Christie strongly implies that this \"quiet retreat in the [[Ardennes]]\"{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 17}} near Spa is the location of the Poirot family home.\n \nAn alternative tradition holds that Poirot was born in the village of [[Ellezelles]] (province of Hainaut, Belgium).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} A few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot can be seen in the centre of this village. There appears to be no reference to this in Christie's writings, but the town of Ellezelles cherishes a copy of Poirot's birth certificate in a local memorial 'attesting' Poirot's birth, naming his father and mother as Jules-Louis Poirot and Godelieve Poirot.\n\nChristie wrote that Poirot is a Catholic by birth,<ref>\"Hercule Poirot was a Catholic by birth.\" {{harvnb|Christie|1947a}}</ref> but not much is described about his later religious convictions, except sporadic references to his \"going to church\".<ref>In ''[[Taken at the Flood]]'', Book II, Chapter 6 Poirot goes into church to pray and happens across a suspect with whom he briefly discusses ideas of sin and confession. {{harvnb|Christie|1948}}</ref> Christie provides little information regarding Poirot's childhood, only mentioning in ''Three Act Tragedy'' that he comes from a large family with little wealth, and has at least one younger sister. Apart from French and English, Poirot is also fluent in German.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2011|loc=Chapter 12}}</ref>\n\n=== Policeman ===\n\n<blockquote>Gustave[...] was not a policeman. I have dealt with policemen all my life and I ''know''. He could pass as a detective to an outsider but not to a man who was a policeman himself.\n\n: \u2014 Hercule Poirot {{harvnb|Christie|1947c}}</blockquote>\n\nHercule Poirot was active in the [[Brussels]] police force by 1893.{{sfn|Christie|2009b|loc=Chapter 15}} Very little mention is made about this part of his life, but in \"[[The Labours of Hercules#The Nemean Lion|The Nemean Lion]]\" (1939) Poirot refers to a Belgian case of his in which \"a wealthy soap manufacturer[...] poisoned his wife in order to be free to marry his secretary\". As Poirot was often misleading about his past to gain information, the truthfulness of that statement is unknown.\n\nInspector Japp offers some insight into Poirot's career with the Belgian police when introducing him to a colleague:\n\n<blockquote>You've heard me speak of Mr Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together \u2013 the Abercrombie forgery case \u2013 you remember he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were the days Moosier. Then, do you remember \"Baron\" Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in Antwerp \u2013 thanks to Mr. Poirot here.{{sfn|Christie|1939|loc=Chapter 7}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the short story [[Poirot's Early Cases#The Chocolate Box|\"The Chocolate Box\"]] (1923), Poirot reveals to [[Captain Arthur Hastings]] an account of what he considers to be his only failure. Poirot admits that he has failed to solve a crime \"innumerable\" times:\n\n<blockquote>I have been called in too late. Very often another, working towards the same goal, has arrived there first. Twice I have been struck down with illness just as I was on the point of success.</blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, he regards the 1893 case in \"The Chocolate Box\",<ref>The date is given in {{harvnb|Christie|2009b|loc=Chapter 15}}</ref> as his only actual failure of detection. Again, Poirot is not reliable as a narrator of his personal history and there is no evidence that Christie sketched it out in any depth. During his police career Poirot shot a man who was firing from a roof into the public below.{{sfn|Christie|1975|loc=Postscript}} In ''[[Lord Edgware Dies]]'', Poirot reveals that he learned to read writing upside down during his police career. Around that time he met Xavier Bouc, director of the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]]. Poirot also became a uniformed director, working on trains.\n\nIn ''The Double Clue,'' Poirot mentions that he was Chief of Police of Brussels, until \"the Great War\" (World War I) forced him to leave for England.\n\n=== Private detective ===\n\n<blockquote>I had called in at my friend Poirot's rooms to find him sadly overworked. So much had he become the rage that every rich woman who had mislaid a bracelet or lost a pet kitten rushed to secure the services of the great Hercule Poirot.{{sfn|Christie|2013b}}</blockquote>\n\nDuring World War I, Poirot left Belgium for England as a [[refugee]] (although he returned a few times). On 16 July 1916 he again met his lifelong friend, Captain Arthur Hastings, and solved the first of his cases to be published, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''. It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for \"some years\". Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, are given in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', Chapter 1.  After that case, Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service and undertook cases for the British government, including foiling the attempted abduction of the [[Prime Minister of Britain|Prime Minister]].<ref>Recounted in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref> Readers were told that the British authorities had learned of Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain members of [[Belgian Royal Family|Belgium's royal family]].\n\n[[File:Florin Court-13909277428.jpg|thumb|[[Florin Court]] became the fictional residence of Agatha Christie's Poirot, known as \"Whitehaven Mansions\"]]\nAfter the war Poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, Flat 203 at 56B Whitehaven Mansions. Hastings first visits the flat when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in ''[[The A.B.C. Murders]]'', Chapter 1. The TV programmes place this in [[Florin Court]], Charterhouse Square, in the wrong part of London.  According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot \"entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion\" and described as the \"newest type of service flat\". (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was \"The Affair at the Victory Ball\", which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as a private detective.\n\nBetween the world wars, Poirot travelled all over Europe, Africa, Asia, and half of South America investigating crimes and solving murders. Most of his cases occurred during this time and he was at the height of his powers at this point in his life. In ''The Murder on the Links'', the Belgian pits his grey cells against a French murderer. In the Middle East, he solved the cases ''Death on the Nile'' and ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' with ease and even survived ''An Appointment with Death''. As he passed through Eastern Europe on his return trip, he solved ''The Murder on the Orient Express''. However he did not travel to North America, the West Indies, the Caribbean or Oceania, probably to avoid sea sickness.\n\n<blockquote>It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The ''mal de mer'' \u2013 it is horrible suffering!<ref>Poirot, in {{harvnb|Christie|2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was during this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims to have been a member of the Russian aristocracy before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of that story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.<ref>Cassatis, John (1979). ''The Diaries of A. Christie''. London.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is the misfortune of small, precise men always to hanker after large and flamboyant women. Poirot had never been able to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him.<ref>\"The Capture of Cerebus\" (1947). The first sentence quoted is also a close paraphrase of something said to Poirot by Hastings in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{harvnb|Christie|2004b}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough letting the Countess escape was morally questionable, it was not uncommon. In ''The Nemean Lion'', Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, allowing her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare the feelings of the murderer's relatives. In ''The Augean Stables'', he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In ''Murder on the Orient Express'', Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder. The victim had been responsible for a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of no fewer than five people. There was no question of his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternative sequence of events to explain the death.\n\nAfter his cases in the Middle East, Poirot returned to Britain. Apart from some of the so-called \"Labours of Hercules\" (see next section) he very rarely went abroad during his later career. He moved into Styles Court towards the end of his life.\n\nWhile Poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients, he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity, although they did not pay well.\n\nPoirot shows a love of steam trains, which Christie contrasts with Hastings' love of autos: this is shown in ''[[Poirot's Early Cases|The Plymouth Express]]'', ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'', ''Murder on the Orient Express'', and ''The ABC Murders'' (in the TV series, steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes).\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\n<blockquote>That\u2019s the way of it. Just a case or two, just one case more \u2013 the Prima Donna\u2019s farewell performance won\u2019t be in it with yours, Poirot.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2006a}} Dr. Burton in the Preface</ref></blockquote>\n\nConfusion surrounds Poirot's retirement. Most of the cases covered by Poirot's private detective agency take place before his retirement to grow [[Squash (plant)|marrows]], at which time he solves ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd''. It has been said that the twelve cases related in ''The Labours of Hercules'' (1947) must refer to a different retirement, but the fact that Poirot specifically says that he intends to grow marrows indicates that these stories also take place before ''Roger Ackroyd'', and presumably Poirot closed his agency once he had completed them. There is specific mention in \"The Capture of Cerberus\" of the twenty-year gap between Poirot's previous meeting with Countess Rossakoff and this one. If the ''Labours'' precede the events in ''Roger Ackroyd'', then the Ackroyd case must have taken place around twenty years ''later'' than it was published, and so must any of the cases that refer to it. One alternative would be that having failed to grow marrows once, Poirot is determined to have another go, but this is specifically denied by Poirot himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2004a|loc=Chapter 13}} in response to the suggestion that he might take up gardening in his retirement, Poirot answers \"Once the vegetable marrows, yes \u2013 but never again\".</ref> Also, in \"The Erymanthian Boar\", a character is said to have been turned out of Austria by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], implying that the events of ''[[The Labours of Hercules]]'' took place after 1937. Another alternative would be to suggest that the Preface to the ''Labours'' takes place at one date but that the labours are completed over a matter of twenty years. None of the explanations is especially attractive.\n\nIn terms of a rudimentary chronology, Poirot speaks of retiring to grow marrows in Chapter 18 of ''The Big Four''{{sfn|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 18}} (1927) which places that novel out of published order before ''Roger Ackroyd''. He declines to solve a case for the Home Secretary because he is retired in Chapter One of ''Peril at End House'' (1932). He is certainly retired at the time of ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1935) but he does not enjoy his retirement and repeatedly takes cases thereafter when his curiosity is engaged. He continues to employ his secretary, Miss Lemon, at the time of the cases retold in ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and ''Dead Man's Folly'', which take place in the mid-1950s. It is therefore better to assume that Christie provided no authoritative chronology for Poirot's retirement, but assumed that he could either be an active detective, a consulting detective, or a retired detective as the needs of the immediate case required.\n\nOne consistent element about Poirot's retirement is that his fame declines during it, so that in the later novels he is often disappointed when characters (especially younger characters) recognise neither him nor his name:\n\n<blockquote>\"I should, perhaps, Madame, tell you a little more about myself. I am ''Hercule Poirot''.\"<br/>\nThe revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved.<br/>\n\"What a lovely name,\" she said kindly. \"Greek, isn't it?\"{{sfn|Christie|1952|loc=Chapter 4}}</blockquote>\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n{{Quote | He, I knew, was not likely to be far from his headquarters. The time when cases had drawn him from one end of England to the other was past. |  Hastings{{Sfn |Christie|2004b|loc = Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}}\n\nPoirot is less active during the cases that take place at the end of his career. Beginning with ''Three Act Tragedy'' (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the periphery of events. In novels such as ''Taken at the Flood'', ''[[After the Funeral]]'', and ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In ''Cat Among the Pigeons'', Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste for him, is impossible to assess. ''[[Crooked House]]'' (1949) and ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (1957), which could easily have been Poirot novels, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works.\n\nTowards the end of his career, it becomes clear that Poirot's retirement is no longer a convenient fiction.  He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels. He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Wilkie Collins]].{{sfn|Christie | 2011c |loc =Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}  In the absence of a more appropriate puzzle, he solves such inconsequential domestic riddles as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his umbrella stand.{{sfn|Christie | 2006a |loc=Chapter 14}} {{Page needed | date = August 2014}}\n\nPoirot (and, it is reasonable to suppose, his creator){{efn | In ''The Pale Horse'', Chapter 1, the novel's narrator, Mark Easterbrook, disapprovingly describes a typical \"Chelsea girl\"{{Sfn | Christie |1961}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} in much the same terms that Poirot uses in Chapter 1 of ''Third Girl'', suggesting that the condemnation of fashion is authorial.{{Sfn | Christie | 2011c}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}} becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people. In ''Hickory Dickory Dock'', he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel, while in ''Third Girl'' (1966) he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths. In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the [[private investigator]], Mr. Goby) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself.\n{{Quote | ''You're too old''.

I'm really very sorry. | Norma Restarick to Poirot in ''Third Girl'', Chapter 1{{Sfn |Christie | 2011c|loc=Chapter 1}}{{Page needed | date = August 2014}}}}\n\nNotably, during this time his physical characteristics also change dramatically, and by the time Arthur Hastings meets Poirot again in ''Curtain'', he looks very different from his previous appearances, having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair.\n\n=== Death ===\n\nOn the ITV television series, Poirot died in October 1949<ref>The extensive letter addressed to Hastings where he explains how he solved the case is dated from October 1949 (\"Curtain\", 2013)</ref> from complications of a heart condition at the end of ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain: Poirot's Last Case]]''. In Christie's novels, he lived into the late 1960s, perhaps even until 1975 when ''Curtain'' was published. In both the novel and the television adaptation, he had moved his [[amyl nitrite]] pills out of his own reach, possibly because of guilt. He thereby became the murderer in ''Curtain'', although it was for the benefit of others. Poirot himself noted that he wanted to kill his victim shortly before his own death so that he could avoid succumbing to the arrogance of the murderer, concerned that he might come to view himself as entitled to kill those whom he deemed necessary to eliminate.\n\nThe \"murderer\" that he was hunting had never actually killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts as nothing more than a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally do anything wrong. It is revealed at the end of ''Curtain'' that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from [[arthritis]], to give the impression that he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are \"''Cher ami!''\", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room. (The TV adaptation adds that as Poirot is dying alone, he whispers out his final prayer to God in these words: \"Forgive me... forgive...\")<ref name=\"Suchet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2506890/Poirot-finale-My-agony-Poirot-drew-breath-David-Suchet.html |title='My agony as Poirot drew out his last breath', by DAVID SUCHET: Shock as the little Belgian sensationally turns out to be the killer in his own final case (SPOILER) |last=Suchet |first=David |authorlink=David Suchet |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> Poirot was buried at Styles, and his funeral was arranged by his best friend Hastings and Hastings' daughter Judith. Hastings reasoned, \"Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country. He was to lie here at the last.\"\n\nPoirot's actual death and funeral occurred in ''Curtain'', years after his retirement from active investigation, but it was not the first time that Hastings attended the funeral of his best friend. In ''The Big Four'' (1927), Poirot feigned his death and subsequent funeral to launch a surprise attack on the Big Four.\n\n== Recurring characters ==\n\n=== Captain Arthur Hastings ===\n{{Main|Arthur Hastings}}\n\nHastings, a former British Army officer, first meets Poirot during Poirot's years as a police officer in Belgium and almost immediately after they both arrive in England. He becomes Poirot's lifelong friend and appears in many cases. Poirot regards Hastings as a poor private detective, not particularly intelligent, yet helpful in his way of being fooled by the criminal or seeing things the way the average man would see them and for his tendency to unknowingly \"stumble\" onto the truth.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |first=Bunson |last=Matthew |title=Hastings, Captain Arthur, O.B.E. |encyclopedia=The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York}}</ref> Hastings marries and has four children \u2013 two sons and two daughters.\nAs a loyal, albeit somewhat na\u00efve companion, Hastings is to Poirot what Watson is to Sherlock Holmes.\n\nHastings is capable of great bravery and courage, facing death unflinchingly when confronted by ''The Big Four'' and displaying unwavering loyalty towards Poirot. However, when forced to choose between Poirot and his wife in that novel, he initially chooses to betray Poirot to protect his wife. Later, though, he tells Poirot to draw back and escape the trap.\n\nThe two are an airtight team until Hastings meets and marries Dulcie Duveen, a beautiful music hall performer half his age, after investigating the ''Murder on the Links''. They later emigrate to Argentina, leaving Poirot behind as a \"very unhappy old man\". However, Poirot and Hastings reunite during the novels ''The Big Four'', ''Peril at End House'', ''The ABC Murders'', ''Lord Edgware Dies'' and ''Dumb Witness'' when Hastings arrives in England for business, with Poirot noting in ''ABC Murders'' that he enjoys having Hastings over because he feels that he always has his most interesting cases with Hastings. The two collaborate for the final time in ''Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'', when the seemingly-crippled Poirot asks Hastings to assist him in his final case. When the killer they are tracking nearly manipulates Hastings into committing murder, Poirot describes this in his final farewell letter to Hastings as the catalyst that prompted him to eliminate the man himself, as Poirot ''knew'' that his friend was not a murderer and refused to let a man capable of manipulating Hastings in such a manner go on.\n\n=== Mrs. Ariadne Oliver ===\n{{Main|Ariadne Oliver}}\nDetective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is not overly fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating\u2013in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth [[Sven Hjerson]]. We never learn anything about her husband, but we do know that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of ''[[Hallowe'en Party]]''. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.\n\nShe has authored over 56 novels and greatly dislikes people modifying her characters. She is the only one in Poirot's universe to have noted that \"It\u2019s not natural for five or six people to be on the spot when B is murdered and all have a motive for killing B.\" She first met Poirot in the story ''Cards on the Table'' and has been bothering him ever since.\n\n=== Miss Felicity Lemon ===\nPoirot's secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, has few human weaknesses. The only mistakes she makes within the series are a typing error during the events of ''Hickory Dickory Dock'' and the mis-mailing of an electricity bill, although she was worried about strange events surrounding her sister at the time. Poirot described her as being \"Unbelievably ugly and incredibly efficient. Anything that she mentioned as worth consideration usually was worth consideration.\" She is an expert on nearly everything and plans to create the perfect filing system. She also worked for the government statistician-turned-philanthropist [[Parker Pyne]]. Whether this was during one of Poirot's numerous retirements or before she entered his employ is unknown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In ''The Agatha Christie Hour'', she was portrayed by British actress Angela Easterling, while in ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'' she was portrayed by [[Pauline Moran]]. On a number of occasions, she joins Poirot in his inquiries or seeks out answers alone at his request.\n\n=== Chief Inspector James Harold Japp ===\n{{Main|Inspector Japp}}\n\nJapp is a [[Scotland Yard]] Inspector and appears in many of the stories trying to solve cases that Poirot is working on. Japp is outgoing, loud and sometimes inconsiderate by nature and his relationship with the refined Belgian is one of the stranger aspects of Poirot's world. He first met Poirot in Belgium in 1904, during the Abercrombie Forgery. Later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara. They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp and lets him take credit in return for special favours. These favours usually entail Poirot being supplied with other interesting cases.<ref>Captain Arthur Hastings {{harvnb|Christie|2004b|loc=Chapter 9}}</ref> In ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'', Japp was portrayed by [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]]. In the film, ''[[Thirteen at Dinner (film)|Thirteen at Dinner]]'' (1985), adapted from ''Lord Edgware Dies'', the role of Japp was taken by the actor [[David Suchet]], who would later star as Poirot in the ITV adaptations.\n\n== Major novels ==\n{{Main|Hercule Poirot in literature}}\nThe Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England, from the first book (''The Mysterious Affair at Styles''), where he is a refugee staying at Styles, to the last Poirot book (''Curtain''), where he visits Styles before his death. In between, Poirot solves cases outside England as well, including his most famous case, ''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1934).\n\nHercule Poirot became famous in 1926 with the publication of ''The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'', whose surprising solution proved controversial. The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels: [[Edmund Wilson]] alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" Aside from ''Roger Ackroyd'', the most critically acclaimed Poirot novels appeared from 1932 to 1942, including ''Murder on the Orient Express'', ''The ABC Murders'' (1935), ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' (1936), and ''Death on the Nile'' (1937), a tale of multiple homicide upon a Nile steamer. ''Death on the Nile'' was judged by detective novelist [[John Dickson Carr]] to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe 1942 novel ''Five Little Pigs'' (a.k.a. ''Murder in Retrospect''), in which Poirot investigates a murder committed sixteen years before by analysing various accounts of the tragedy, is a ''[[Rashomon (movie)|Rashomon]]''-like performance. In his analysis of this book, critic and mystery novelist [[Robert Barnard]] referred to it as \"the best Christie of all\".<ref>Barnard (1980), p. 85</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the Poirot canon was added to by the first author to be commissioned by the Christie estate to write an original story, [[Sophie Hannah]]. The novel was called ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', and was set in the late 1920s, placing it chronologically between ''[[The Mystery of the Blue Train]]'' and ''[[Peril at End House]]''. A second Hannah-penned Poirot came out in 2016, called ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A461530204/ITOF?u=mlin_c_worpoly&sid=ITOF&xid=42ac4a2a.|title=Hannah, Sophie.

An elderly [[spinster]] who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]], she is one of the most loved and famous of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first appearance was in a short story published in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' in December 1927, \"[[The Tuesday Night Club]]\",<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Curran|title=Agatha Christie: Murder in the Making|location=New York|publisher=Harper|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-206542-1|page=140}}</ref> which later became the first chapter of ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West), and her cronies.<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex.

This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West appears in some stories including ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'', which also feature his wife Joan, a modern artist (though prior to their marriage she is referred to as \"Joyce Lempri\u00e8re\", in ''The Thirteen Problems'' stories). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating maid, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as 'an old lady' in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding \"Sleeping Murder\", 41 years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]''.\n\nLittle is known about Marple's background, except that she has two younger sisters. One of them is the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]], and the other is mother to Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Novels featuring Miss Marple==\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943)\n# ''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' (1950)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'', or ''Murder with Mirrors'' (1952)\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'', or ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''

Four stories in the ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories|Three Blind Mice]]'' collection (1950) feature Miss Marple: \"Strange Jest\", \"Tape-Measure Murder\", \"The Case of the Caretaker\", and \"The Case of the Perfect Maid\".\n\nThe Autograph edition of ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'' includes the eight in the original plus \"Greenshaw's Folly\".\n\n==Books about Miss Marple==\n* ''The Life and Times of Miss Jane Marple'' \u2013 a [[biography]] by [[Anne Hart (Canadian author)|Anne Hart]]\n\n==Films==\n\n===Margaret Rutherford===\nAlthough popular from her first appearance in 1930, Jane Marple had to wait thirty-two years for her first [[film|big-screen]] appearance, starring [[Margaret Rutherford]]. These were popular and successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer,  and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This first film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]] (who would later play the role of Miss Marple in 1984-92) plays the daily in the household. \n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 Hercule Poirot novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to ''The Mousetrap''. Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the spoof Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]] and is still played on radio today. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations on each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 70 years old when the first film was made, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes.\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the Russian language film adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role. In the 1940s, she appeared on-stage in an Agatha Christie play, ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, \"I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple\".<ref name=\"celebration140\">{{cite book| last = Haining| first = Peter| title = Agatha Christie: Murder in four acts : a centenary celebration of 'The Queen of Crime' on stage, films, radio & TV| year = 1990| publisher = Carol Pub Group| isbn = 978-1-85227-273-9| page = 140 }}</ref> (Coincidentally, Hickson had played a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]'', the first film in which Margaret Rutherford played Miss Marple.)<ref name=\"celebration140\"/> In addition she portrayed a maid in the 1937 film, ''[[Love from a Stranger (1937 film)|Love from a Stranger]]'', which starred Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone, another Agatha Christie play adaptation.

[[Geraldine McEwan]] starred in the first three series. [[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations are notable for changing the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

seasonal equivalent to [[October]] in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Romans gave this month the [[Latin]] name ''[[Aprilis]]''<ref name=Chambers>\"April\" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]],  and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''

[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. 23 September 2008.</ref> It was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]] because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, and [[March]] was the first month of the year. About 700&nbsp;BC, it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of [[Augustus]]. According to a [[Senatus consultum]] quoted by [[Macrobius]], he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=calendarium-cn|title=Year of Julius Caesar, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890), William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G.

In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome.<ref>[[Supplicia canum]] was held on August 3, [[Lychnapsia]] on August 12, [[Nemoralia]] was held from August 13\u201315 (or on the full moon of August), [[Tiberinalia]] and [[Portunus (mythology)|Portumnalia]] on August 17, [[Consualia|Consuales Ludi]] on August 18, [[Vinalia|Vinalia rustica]] on August 19, [[Vulcan (mythology)#Vulcanalia|Vulcanalia]] on August 23, [[Opiconsivia]] on August 25, and [[Volturnalia]] on August 27. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.</ref>\n\nCertain [[meteor shower]]s take place in August. The [[Kappa Cygnids]] take place in August, with the dates varying each year. The [[Alpha Capricornids]] meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the  [[Southern Delta Aquariids]] take place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28\u201329. The [[Perseids]], a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. The star cluster of [[Messier 30]] is best observed around August.\n\nAmong the aborigines of the [[Canary Islands]], especially among the [[Guanches]] of [[Tenerife]], the month of August received in the name of Be\u00f1esmer or [[Be\u00f1esmen]], which was also the harvest festival held this month.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abr\u00e9u Galindo |first=Juan de |authorlink=Juan de Abr\u00e9u Galindo

from religious texts, such as the [[Bible]] and [[Quran]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister [[Miriam]] remained with their [[kinship|kinsmen]] in the eastern border-land of Egypt ([[Land of Goshen|Goshen]]). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the [[Israelites]], Aaron served as his brother's spokesman (\"prophet\") to the Pharaoh.<ref>{{bibleref|Exodus|7:1|9}}</ref> Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] of the [[Israelites]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rockwood|2007|p=1}}</ref>\n\nAaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on [[Mount Hor]] (Numbers 33:39;<ref name=\"jd3\">{{harvnb|McCurdy|1906|p=3}}</ref><ref name=\"Bibleref|Numbers|20:22|29|KJV\">{{Bibleref|Numbers|20:22|KJV}}</ref><ref name=\"Bibleref|Numbers|33:38|39|KJV\">{{Bibleref|Numbers|33:38|KJV}}</ref> Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at [[moseroth|Moserah]]).<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|10:6|KJV}}</ref> Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|1:5}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse||Acts|7:40}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse||Hebrews|5:4}}</ref><ref>{{ Bibleverse||Hebrews|7:11|31}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4}}</ref>\n\n==Biblical narrative==\nAccording to the [[Book of Exodus]], Aaron first functioned as [[Moses]]' assistant. Because Moses complained that he could not speak well, God appointed Aaron as Moses' \"prophet\" (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1).{{refn|group=note|He spoke and acted on behalf of Moses with the Egyptian royal court, including performing miraculous \"signs\" to validate Moses' mission.}} At the command of [[Moses]], he let his rod turn into a snake.<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A9\u20137%3A9&version=NRSV Exodus 7:9, New Revised Standard Version]</ref> Then he stretched out his [[Aaron's rod|rod]] in order to bring on the first three plagues.<ref>Exodus 7:19 {{Bibleref|Exodus|7:19||HE}}, Exodus 8:1,12.</ref><ref>Exodus 8:1, {{Bibleref|Exodus|8:1||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 8:12{{Bibleref|Exodus|8:12||HE}}</ref> After that, Moses tended to act and speak for himself.<ref>Exodus 9:23 {{Bibleref|Exodus|9:23||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 10:13 {{Bibleref|Exodus|10:13||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 10:22 {{Bibleref|Exodus|10:22||HE}}</ref>\n\nDuring the journey in the wilderness, Aaron was not always prominent or active. At the [[Battle of Refidim|battle with Amalek]], he was chosen with [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] to support the hand of Moses that held the \"[[Staff of Moses|rod of God]]\".<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|17:9|KJV}}</ref> When the revelation was given to Moses at [[biblical Mount Sinai]], he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit. While [[Joshua]] went with Moses to the top, however, Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people.<ref>\n{{Bibleref|Exodus|24:9|14|KJV}}</ref> From here on in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, Joshua appears in the role of Moses' assistant while Aaron functions instead as the first high priest.\n\n===High Priest===\n{{See also|High Priest of Israel|Kohen}}\nThe books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] maintain that Aaron received from God a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants (Exodus 28:1). The family of Aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to [[Yahweh]]. The rest of his tribe, the [[Levite]]s, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3). Moses anointed and consecrated Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf. Exodus 28-29). He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27). Aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the [[Urim and Thummim]] by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).<ref name=Olson>{{harvnb|Olson|2000|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the [[Torah]]) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11). The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).<ref>{{harvnb|Mariottini|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|6:22|27|KJV}}</ref> When Aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with Moses, \"blessed the people: and the glory of the {{LORD}} appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the {{LORD}}, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces\" (Leviticus 9:23-24).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|9:23|24|KJV}}</ref> In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.<ref name=\"phod\">{{harvnb|Souvay|1913|p=7}}</ref>\n\nIn later books of the Hebrew Bible, Aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the [[Babylonian captivity]] and later. The books of [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The [[Book of Ezekiel]], which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the [[Zadokites]] after one of King David's priests.<ref name=Olson/> It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]]. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the [[Second Temple period]].<ref>{{harvnb|VanderKam|2004}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}</ref> Most scholars think the Torah reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.\n\n===Conflicts===\nAaron plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts during Israel's wilderness wanderings. During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked Aaron to make a [[golden calf]]. (Exodus 32:1-6). This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites (Exodus 32:10). Moses successfully intervened, but then led the loyal Levites in executing many of the culprits; a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|32:35||KJV}}</ref> Aaron, however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.<ref>{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|9:20|| KJV }}</ref> Later retellings of this story almost always excuse Aaron for his role.<ref name=\"Watts 2011\">{{harvnb|Watts|2011}}</ref> For example, in rabbinic sources<ref>Talmud Shabbat 99a</ref><ref>Exodus Rabbah 41</ref> and in the Quran, Aaron was not the idol-maker and upon Moses' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).<ref>{{Cite quran|7|142|e=152|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of Aaron's consecration, his oldest sons, [[Nadab and Abihu]], were burned up by divine fire because they offered \"strange\" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|10:1|3||HE}}</ref> Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families some time in Israel's past. Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.<ref name=\"Watts 2011\"/>\n\nThe Torah generally depicts the siblings, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical [[Book of Micah]].<ref>{{bibleref|Micah|6:4|9}}</ref> Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion, Aaron and Miriam complained about Moses' exclusive claim to be the {{LORD}}'s prophet.<ref>{{bibleref|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref> Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed Moses' uniqueness as the one with whom the {{LORD}} spoke face to face. Miriam was punished with a skin disease (''[[tzaraath]]'') that turned her skin white. Aaron pleaded with Moses to intercede for her, and Miriam, after seven days' quarantine, was healed. Aaron once again escaped any retribution.\n\nAccording to Numbers 16-17, a Levite named [[Korah]] led many in challenging Aaron's exclusive claim to the priesthood. When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth (Numbers 16:25-35),<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|196:23|35|KJV}}</ref> [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the [[censer]]s of the dead priests. And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:1|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|16:36|KJV}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hirschvogel The Blossoming of Aarons Rod.jpg|thumb|right|The Blossoming of Aaron's Rod, etching by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]]]\nTo emphasize the validity of the Levites' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites, Moses collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods overnight in the [[tent of meeting]]. The next morning, Aaron's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:8).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:8|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mays|2000|p=177}}</ref> The following chapter then details the distinction between Aaron's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only Levites) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the [[Kohen|Aaronites]] alone (Numbers 18:1-7).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|18:1|KJV}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nAaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites<ref name=\"jd3\"/> because the two brothers showed impatience at [[Meribah]] ([[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]]) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst. Although they had been commanded to speak to the rock, Moses struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the {{LORD}} (Numbers 20:7-11).<ref name=\"jd3\"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|20:7|11|KJV}}</ref>\n\nThere are two accounts of the death of Aaron in the Torah.<ref name=\"jd3\"/> Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah, Aaron with his son Eleazar and Moses ascended Mount Hor. There Moses stripped Aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to Eleazar.

It says that he was a descendant of Abraham (Quran 4: 163) and makes it clear that both he and Moses were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Quran 10: 75). It further adds that Moses had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with Aaron (Quran 20: 29-30) and that Aaron helped Moses as he too was a prophet (Quran 19: 53), and very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Quran 28: 34). The Quran adds that both Moses and Aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Quran 10: 87).\n\nThe incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Quran paints Aaron in a positive light. The Quran says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses was up on ''Tur Sina\u2019'' ({{lang-ar|\u0637\u064f\u0640\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0646\u0640\u0627\u0621}}, [[Mount Sinai]]) for a period of forty days (Quran 7: 142).<ref name=\"Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns\"/> It adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by Aaron but by a wicked man by the name of '[[Samiri (Islamic figure)|As-Samiri]]' (Quran 19: 50). When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked Aaron for allowing the worship of the idol, to which Aaron pleaded with Moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Quran 7: 150).<ref name=\"Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns\"/> The Quran then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel, and said that he only had power over himself and Aaron (Quran 5: 25).\n\nAaron is later commemorated in the Quran as one who had a \"clear authority\" (Quran 23: 45) and one who was \"guided to the Right Path\" (Quran 37: 118). It further adds that Aaron's memory was left for people who came after him (Quran 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Quran 37: 120). The Quran also says that people called [[Jesus in Islam|\u2018Isa]]'s mother [[Mary in Islam|Maryam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0631\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0645}}, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]) a \"sister of Harun\" (Quran 19: 28). Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this \"Harun\" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to Aaron of the Exodus, and the term \"sister\" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when Mary was a descendant of the priestly lineage of Aaron, while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of [[Christ]] by the name of \"Aaron\". Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked Mary spiritually with the actual sister of Aaron, her namesake [[Miriam|Miryam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0650\u0640\u0631\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0645}}, {{lang-he|\u05de\u05b4\u05e8\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05dd}}),<ref name=\"RU2016\">''Unless otherwise stated, the Jewish primary sources herein were provided courtesy of Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman in honor of M.A.M. from his 3-part series on Miriam the Prophetess, posted on RabbiUllman.com.

In reply, the Prophet said: \"They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine.

In these shorthands, R, R', and R\" represent [[substituents]], alkyl or other attached, generally organic groups.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:600px; white-space:nowrap;\" \n! Type\n!

The combined capacity of the other alcohols is about the same, distributed roughly equally.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n{{main|ethanol|methanol}}\nWith respect to acute toxicity, simple alcohols have low acute toxicities.  Doses of several milliliters are tolerated.  For [[pentanol]]s, [[hexanol]]s, [[octanol]]s and longer alcohols, [[LD50]] range from 2\u20135 g/kg (rats, oral).  Methanol and ethanol are less acutely toxic.  All alcohols are mild skin irritants.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\nThe metabolism of methanol (and ethylene glycol) is affected by the presence of ethanol, which has a higher affinity for [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]].  In this way methanol will be excreted intact in urine.<ref name=\"Schep\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |issue= |pages=b3929 |date=30 September 2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = HE | last2 = Burkhart | first2 = KK | last3 = Donovan | first3 = JW | title = Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning: diagnosis and treatment | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 116\u201320 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10097201 | name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1016/S0099-1767(99)70156-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lobert | first1 = S | title = Ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Critical care nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 41\u20137 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11878258 | name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties==\nIn general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes alcohols [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to most other compounds.  Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons.  Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.\n\nBecause of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29&nbsp;\u00b0C, compared to 69&nbsp;\u00b0C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]], and 34.6&nbsp;\u00b0C for [[diethyl ether]].\n\n==Occurrence in nature==\nSimple alcohols are found widely in nature.  Ethanol is most prominent because it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway.  The other simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts.  More complex alcohols are pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Ziegler and oxo processes===\nIn the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>  An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown:\n\n:Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>  +  9 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>   \u2192  Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\n:Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub> +  3 O  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  \u2192  3 HOC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>  +  Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].\n\nMany higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:<ref name=\"Ullmann1\"/>\n\n:RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>  +  CO   \u2192  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO\n:RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO +  3 H<sub>2</sub>  \u2192  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH\n\nSuch processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.\n\n===Hydration reactions===\nSome low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])<ref name=\"ECT4 820\">{{cite book |author =Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor=Kroschwitz J.I. |title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th |volume=9 |page=820 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-52677-0}}</ref> or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].\n\nHydration is also used industrially to produce the diol [[ethylene glycol]] from [[ethylene oxide]].\n\n===Biological routes===\nEthanol is obtained by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&nbsp;\u00b0C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme complex [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).\n\nSeveral species of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause \"[[auto-brewery syndrome]]\" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01873798 |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author1=P.

(Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].\n\n====Reduction====\n[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto-esters.\n\n====Hydrolysis====\n[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.\n\nThe formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:\n\n:[[File:Secondary alcohol formation-diagram.svg|frameless|upright=1.6|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]\n\n==Reactions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===Deprotonation===\nWith a [[pKa|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of around 16\u201319, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]].  With strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[sodium]] they form [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s  called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O<sup>\u2212</sup> [[Metal|M]]<sup>+</sup>.\n: 2 R-OH + 2 NaH  \u2192 2 R-O<sup>\u2212</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>\n: 2 R-OH + 2 Na   \u2192   2 R-O<sup>\u2212</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe acidity of alcohols is strongly affected by [[solvation]].  In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than is water.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Nucleophilic substitution===\nThe OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R\u2212OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.gif|frameless|upright=3.2|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]\n\nAlcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:\n\n: 3 R-OH + PBr<sub>3</sub> \u2192 3 RBr + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>\n\nIn the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.\n\n===Dehydration===\nMeanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:\n\n[[File:Methanol_acid_base.svg|frameless|upright=2.25|Acidity & basicity of methanol]]\n\nUpon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 [[elimination reaction]] to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.\n\nThis is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethylene]]:\n\n[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|frameless|upright=2.5]]\n\nA more controlled elimination reaction is the  with [[carbon disulfide]] and [[iodomethane]].\n\n===Esterification===\nAlcohol and [[carboxylic acid]]s react in the so-called [[Fischer esterification]].  The reaction usually requires a [[catalyst]], such as concentrated sulfuric acid:\n: R-OH + R'-CO<sub>2</sub>H \u2192 R'-CO<sub>2</sub>R + H<sub>2</sub>O\nOther types of ester are prepared in a similar manner{{snd}} for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.\n\n===Oxidation===\n{{Main|Alcohol oxidation}}\nPrimary alcohols (R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO<sub>2</sub>H).  The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.\n\nThe direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.\n\n[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|upright=2.25|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]\n\nReagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Enol]]\n* [[Ethanol fuel]]\n* [[Fatty alcohol]]\n* [[Index of alcohol-related articles]]\n* [[Polyol]]\n* [[Rubbing alcohol]]\n* [[Sugar alcohol]]\n* [[Transesterification]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=The World in So Many Words |first=Allan A. |last=Metcalf |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1999 |isbn=0-395-95920-9 <!--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O0W5XyQVCYC&pg=PA123&dq=sash+etymology+arabic&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=iuzjUzyPphZKCIJLAwJZE7beIEI#PPA123,M1-->}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q156|wikt=alcohol|m=no|mw=no|species=no|voy=alcohol|v=Category:Alcohol|s=Category:Alcohol}}\n* [http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_alcohol.htm Alcohol (Ethanol)] at ''[[The Periodic Table of Videos]]'' (University of Nottingham)\n\n{{Alcohols|state=expanded}}\n{{Alcohol by countries}}\n{{Functional group}}\n{{Bioenergy}}\n{{Alternative propulsion}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alcohols| ]]\n[[Category:Antiseptics]]\n[[Category:Functional groups]]", "sha1": "6y4l82zg2i3a1b9e8yloff4w36bm4w8"}}, {"title": "Achill Island", "ns": "0", "id": "1016", "revision": {"id": "866735231", "parentid": "863215984", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T06:14:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "ZackBot", "id": "29639097"}, "comment": "fixing deprecated params from [[Template:Infobox islands]] - [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/ZackBot_11|BRFA Trial]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Achill|the village on the island of Canna, Scotland|A'Chill}}\n{{ref improve|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox islands\n| name             = Achill\n| image_name       = Achillsatmap.jpg \n| image_caption    = View of the Island using [[NASA]]'s technology overhead\n| map              = Ireland\n| coordinates = {{coords|53.96391|-10.00303|display=it}}\n| native_name      = Acaill, Oile\u00e1n Acla\n| native_name_link = \n| nickname         = \n| location         = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n| archipelago      = Achill\n| total_islands    = 3 (Achill,Innisbiggle and Achillbeg islands)\n| major_islands    = Achill\n| coastline_km     = 128\n| highest_mount    = [[Croaghaun]]\n| elevation_m      = 688\n| area_acre        = 36572 \n| country          = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title     = [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]\n| country_admin_divisions           = [[Connacht]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title_1   = [[Counties of Ireland|County]]\n| country_admin_divisions_1         = [[County Mayo|Mayo]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title_2   = [[Barony (Ireland)|Barony]]\n| country_admin_divisions_2         = [[Burrishoole]]\n| country_capital_city              = \n| country_largest_city              = \n| country_largest_city_population   = \n| country_leader_title              = \n| country_leader_name               = \n| population       = 2,569\n| population_as_of = 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishislands.info/census/graphs/numbers.html|title=Island Change in Population, 1841 - 2011 |date=28 January 2013 }}</ref>\n| density_km2      = 17.3\n| ethnic_groups    = [[Irish people|Irish]]\n| additional_info  = Ireland's largest island\n}}\n\n'''Achill Island''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|k|\u0259l}}; {{lang-ga|Acaill, Oile\u00e1n Acla}}) in [[County Mayo]] is the largest of the [[Irish isles]], and is situated off the west coast of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It has a population of 2,700. Its area is {{convert|148|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Achill is attached to the mainland by [[Michael Davitt Bridge]], between the villages of Gob an Choire ([[Achill Sound]]) and Poll Raithn\u00ed ([[Polranny]]). A [[bridge]] was first completed here in 1887, replaced by another structure in 1949, and subsequently replaced with the current bridge which was completed in 2008. Other centres of population include the villages of Keel, [[Dooagh]], Dumha \u00c9ige ([[Dooega]]), D\u00fan Ibhir ([[Dooniver]]), The Valley and Dugort. The parish's main [[Gaelic football]] pitch and [[secondary school]] are on the mainland at Poll Raithn\u00ed. Early [[human settlement]]s are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BC. A paddle dating from this period was found at the [[crann\u00f3g]] near Dookinella.\nThe island is 87% [[peat bog]].\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that at the end of the [[Neolithic Period]] (around 4000 BC), Achill had a population of 500\u20131,000 people. The island would have been mostly forest until the Neolithic people began [[agriculture|crop cultivation]]. Settlement increased during the [[Iron Age]], and the dispersal of small [[promontory fort]]s around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times. [[Megalithic tomb]]s and forts can be seen at Slievemore, along the Atlantic Drive and on [[Achillbeg]].\n\n===Overlords===\nAchill Island lies in the Barony of [[Burrishoole]], in the territory of ancient [[Umaill|Umhall]] (Umhall Uactarach and Umhall Ioctarach), that originally encompassed an area extending from the [[County Galway]]/Mayo border to Achill Head.\n\nThe hereditary chieftains of Umhall were the O'Malleys, recorded in the area in 814 AD when they successfully repelled an onslaught by the Vikings in [[Clew Bay]]. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] invasion of [[Connacht]] in 1235 AD saw the territory of Umhall taken over by the Butlers and later by the de Burgos. The Butler Lordship of Burrishoole continued into the late 14th century when Thomas le Botiller was recorded as being in possession of Akkyll & Owyll.\n\n===Immigration===\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, there was much migration to Achill from other parts of Ireland, particularly [[Ulster]], due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there were two different [[dialect]]s of Irish being spoken on Achill. This led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824 [[Ordnance Survey]], and some maps today give different names for the same place. Achill Irish still has many traces of [[Ulster Irish]].\n\n===Specific historical sites and events===\n\n====Grace O'Malley's Castle====\n[[Carrickkildavnet Castle]] is a 15th-century tower house associated with the O'Malley Clan, who were once a ruling family of Achill. [[Grace O' Malley]], or Granuaile, the most famous of the O'Malleys, was born on [[Clare Island]] around 1530.<ref name= \"piratequeen\">{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=Peter |url= http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160615-the-pirate-queen-of-county-mayo |title=The Pirate Queen of County Mayo |work=[[BBC]] |date=2016-06-20 |accessdate=2017-02-02}}</ref> Her father was the chieftain of the barony of [[Murrisk]]. The O'Malleys were a powerful seafaring family, who traded widely. Grace became a fearless leader and gained fame as a sea captain and pirate. She is reputed to have met with [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1593. She died around 1603 and is buried in the O'Malley family tomb on Clare Island.\n\n====Achill Mission====\n[[File:The Colony, Achill (21330853923).jpg|thumbnail|left|View of the \"Colony\", prior to 1900.]]\nOne of Achill's most famous historical sites is that of the [[Achill Mission]] or 'the Colony' at Dugort. In 1831 the [[Church of Ireland]] Reverend Edward Nangle founded a [[proselytising]] mission at Dugort. The Mission included schools, cottages, an orphanage, an infirmary and a guesthouse. The Colony was very successful for a time and regularly produced a newspaper called the ''Achill Herald and Western Witness''. Nangle expanded his mission into Mweelin, where a school was built. The Achill Mission began to decline slowly after Nangle was moved from Achill and was finally closed in the 1880s. Nangle died in 1883.\n\n====Railway====\nIn 1894, the Westport - Newport railway line was extended to Achill Sound. The railway station is now a hostel. The train provided a great service to Achill, but it also is said to have fulfilled an ancient prophecy. [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|Brian Rua O' Cearbhain]] had prophesied that 'carts on iron wheels' would carry bodies into Achill on their first and last journey. In 1894, the first train on the Achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the [[Clew Bay Drowning]]. This tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in Clew Bay, drowning thirty-two young people. They had been going to meet the steamer which would take them to Scotland for potato picking.\n\nThe [[Kirkintilloch Fire]] in 1937 almost fulfilled the second part of the prophecy when the bodies of ten victims were carried by rail to Achill. While it was not literally the last train, the railway would close just two weeks later. These people had died in a fire in a [[bothy]] in [[Kirkintilloch]]. This term referred to the temporary accommodation provided for those who went to Scotland to pick potatoes, a migratory pattern that had been established in the early nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Memorial for the victims of the Clew Bay Drowning on 15 June 1894 at Kildavenet Graveyard, Achill Island.jpg|thumb|Memorial for the victims of the [[Clew Bay Drowning]] on 15 June 1894 at [[Kildavenet]] Graveyard]]\n\n====Kildamhnait====\nKildamhnait on the south-east coast of Achill is named after St. Damhnait, or Dymphna, who founded a church there in the 16th century. There is also a holy well just outside the graveyard. The present church was built in the 1700s and the graveyard contains memorials to the victims of two of Achill's greatest tragedies, the Kirchintilloch Fire (1937) and the [[Clew Bay Drowning]] (1894).\n\n====The Monastery====\nIn 1852, Dr. John McHale, Archbishop of Tuam set aside land in Bunnacurry for the building of a monastery. A Franciscan Monastery was built which, for many years provided an education for local children. The ruins of this monastery are still to be seen in Bunnacurry today.\n\n====The Valley House====\nThe historic Valley House is located in The Valley, near Dugort in the north-east of Achill Island. The present building sits on the site of a hunting lodge built by the Earl of Cavan in the 19th century. Its notoriety arises from an incident in 1894 in which the then owner, an English landlady named Agnes McDonnell, was savagely beaten and the house set alight, allegedly by a local man, James Lynchehaun. Lynchehaun had been employed by McDonnell as her land agent, but the two fell out and he was sacked and told to quit his accommodation on her estate. A lengthy legal battle ensued, with Lynchehaun refusing to leave. At the time, in the 1890s, the issue of land ownership in Ireland was politically charged, and after the events at the Valley House in 1894 Lynchehaun was to claim that his actions were motivated by politics. He escaped custody and fled to the United States, where he successfully defeated legal attempts by the British authorities to have him extradited to face charges arising from the attack and the burning of the Valley House. Agnes McDonnell suffered terrible injuries from the attack but survived and lived for another 23 years, dying in 1923. Lynchehaun is said to have returned to Achill on two occasions, once in disguise as an American tourist, and eventually died in Girvan, Scotland, in 1937. The Valley House is now a Hostel and Bar.\n[[File:Deserted village - Achill.jpg|thumb|View of the deserted village from beside the ruins of one of the houses]]\n[[File:Inside deserted house - Achill.jpg|thumb|Inside the ruins of one of the houses at the deserted village]]\n\n====The Deserted Village====\nClose by Dugort, at the base of Slievemore mountain lies the Deserted Village. There are approximately 80 ruined houses in the village.\n\nThe houses were built of unmortared stone, which means that no cement or mortar was used to hold the stones together. Each house consisted of just one room and this room was used as a kitchen, living room, bedroom and even a stable.\n\nIf one looks at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like potatoes were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.\n\nFor many years people lived in the village and then in 1845 Famine struck in Achill as it did in the rest of Ireland. Most of the families moved to the nearby village of Dooagh, which is beside the sea, while some others emigrated. Living beside the sea meant that fish and shellfish could be used for food. The village was completely abandoned which is where the name 'Deserted Village' came from.\n\nNo one has lived in these houses since the time of the Famine, however, the families that moved to Dooagh and their descendants, continued to use the village as a 'booley village'. This means that during the summer season, the younger members of the family, teenage boys and girls, would take the cattle to graze on the hillside and they would stay in the houses of the Deserted Village. This custom continued until the 1940s. Boolying was also carried out in other areas of Achill, including Annagh on Croaghaun mountain and in Curraun.\n\nAt Ailt, Kildownet, you can see the remains of a similar deserted village. This village was deserted in 1855 when the tenants were evicted by the local landlord so the land could be used for cattle grazing, the tenants were forced to rent holdings in Currane, Dooega and Slievemore. Others emigrated to America.\n\n===Archaeology===\n[[File:KeemBayAchillJune.JPG|thumb|left|[[Keem Bay]]]]Achill Archaeological Field School is based at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh, which has served as a catalyst for a wide array of archaeological investigations on the island. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at [[Slievemore]], incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the [[Neolithic]] to the Post Medieval.<ref>{{cite web | title=Achill Archaeological Field School 2009 | work=Achill Archaeological Field School | url=http://www.achill-fieldschool.com/ | accessdate=7 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228224527/http://www.achill-fieldschool.com/| archivedate= 28 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Recent archaeological  research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied [[booley village]] by the first half of the 20th century.

This project focused on the documentation of archaeological resources related to Achill's rich maritime heritage.  Maritime archaeologists recorded 19th century fishing station, ice house, and boat house ruins, a number of anchors which had been salvaged from the sea, 19th century and more recent [[currach]] pens, a number of traditional vernacular watercraft including a possibly 100-year-old Achill yawl, and the remains of four historic shipwrecks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimehistory.org/content/achill-island-maritime-archaeology-project |title=Achill Island Maritime Archaeology Project &#124; Institute of Maritime History |publisher=Maritimehistory.org |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11457-013-9123-3#page-1 |title=Meide, Chuck and Kathryn Sikes (2014) Manipulating the Maritime Cultural Landscape: Vernacular Boats and Economic Relations on Nineteenth-Century Achill Island, Ireland.

Near the westernmost point of Achill, [[Achill Head]], is [[Keem Bay]]. [[Keel Beach]] is quite popular with [[tourist]]s and some locals as a [[surfing]] location. South of Keem beach is [[Moytoge Head]], which with its rounded appearance drops dramatically down to the [[ocean]]. An old [[United Kingdom|British]] observation post, built during [[World War I]] to prevent the [[Germany|Germans]] from landing arms for the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]], is still standing on Moytoge. During the Second World War this post was rebuilt by the Irish Defence Forces as a Look Out Post for the Coast Watching Service wing of the Defence Forces.

The area also boasts an approximately 5000-year-old [[Neolithic tomb]].\n\n[[Achillbeg]] (''{{lang|ga|Acaill Beag}}'', ''Little Achill'') is a small island just off Achill's southern tip.

It is noted for its associations with [[Grace O'Malley]], along with the larger [[Rockfleet Castle]] in Newport.\n\n==Economy==\nWhile a number of attempts at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, the economy of the island is largely dependent on [[tourism]]. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in the United Kingdom, the United States and Africa allowed many families to remain living in Achill throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Since the advent of Ireland's \"[[Celtic Tiger]]\" [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy]] fewer Achill people were forced to look for work abroad. [[Agriculture]] plays a small role and the fact that the island is mostly bog means that its potential for agriculture is limited largely to [[sheep farming]]. In the past, [[fishing]] was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its [[shark]] fishing, [[basking shark]] in particular was fished for its valuable [[liver oil]]. There was a big spurt of growth in tourism in the 1960s and 1970s before which life was tough and difficult on the island. Despite healthy visitor numbers each year, the common perception is that tourism in Achill has been slowly declining since its heyday. Currently, the largest employers on Achill are two hotels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandbyways.com/top-irish-peninsulas/the-west/the-western-isles/achill-island-co-mayo/ |title=Achill Island (Co.

A university was started by the missions to Achill in Mweelin. In the modern age, there used to be two [[secondary school]]s in Achill, [[Mc Hale College]] and [[Scoil Damhnait]]. However, in August 2011, the two schools amalgamated to form [[Col\u00e1iste Pobail Acla]]. For primary education, there are nine [[National Schools]] including Bullsmouth NS, Valley NS, Bunnacurry NS, Dookinella NS, Dooagh NS, Saula NS, Achill Sound NS, Tonragee NS and Curanne NS.

City Lights Books.</ref>\n\n===New York Beats===\nIn Ginsberg's freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate [[Lucien Carr]], who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including [[Jack Kerouac]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[John Clellon Holmes]]. They bonded, because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of post\u2013World War II, McCarthy-era America.<ref name=\"Raskin\" /> Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Yeats' \"A Vision\"), for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to [[Neal Cassady]], for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation.<ref>Barry Gifford, ed., ''As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady''.</ref> In the first chapter of his 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]]'' Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady.<ref name=\"Modern\" /> Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg's association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in ''On the Road''. This was a source of strain in their relationship.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nAlso, in New York, Ginsberg met [[Gregory Corso]] in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso's poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nShortly after this period in Ginsberg's life, he became romantically involved with [[Elise Cowen|Elise Nada Cowen]] after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at [[Barnard College]] whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation's period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], when she met [[Joyce Johnson]] and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and ''Come and Join the Dance'', which expressed the two women's experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\n\n===\"Blake vision\"===\nIn 1948 in an apartment in [[Harlem]], Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of [[William Blake]] (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading ''[[Ah! Sun-flower]]'', ''[[The Sick Rose]]'', and ''Little Girl Lost'', also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the [[ancient of days]]\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the [[fire escape]] and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs.<ref name=\"Miles\" /> Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself. Or that God was in front of my eyes - existence itself was God\" and \"And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in.\" <ref name=\"On the Poetry of Allen Ginsberg\">{{cite book|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Allen|editor1-last=Hyde|editor1-first=Lewis|title=On the Poetry of Allen Ginsberg|date=1984|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0-472-09353-3|page=123|edition=2002|chapter=A Blake Experience}}</ref>\n\n===San Francisco Renaissance===\nGinsberg moved to San Francisco during the 1950s. Before ''Howl and Other Poems'' was published in 1956 by City Lights Bookshop, he worked as a market researcher.<ref name=\"Schumacher, Michael 2002\">Schumacher, Michael (January 27, 2002). \"Allen Ginsberg Project\".</ref>\n\nIn 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met [[Peter Orlovsky]] (1933\u20132010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner.<ref name=\"Miles\" /> Selections from their correspondence have been published.<ref>''Straight Hearts' Delight: Love Poems and Selected Letters'', by Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, edited by Winston Leyland. Gay Sunshine Press, 1980, {{ISBN|0917342658}}</ref>\n\nAlso in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the [[San Francisco Renaissance]] (James Broughton, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason and Kenneth Rexroth) and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg's mentor [[William Carlos Williams]] wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and [[Zen]] enthusiasts who had become friends at [[Reed College]]: [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]], and [[Lew Welch]]. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, [[Bob Kaufman]], [[A. D. Winans]], and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the ''Beatitude'' poetry magazine.\n\n[[Wally Hedrick]]&nbsp;\u2014 a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery&nbsp;\u2014 approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it.<ref name=\"Raskin\" /> Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The [[Six Gallery reading]]\" took place on October 7, 1955.<ref name=npr>{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4950578| title=Birth of the Beat Generation: 50 Years of ''Howl''| first=Robert | last=Siegel| access-date=October 2, 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017033639/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4950578| archivedate=October 17, 2006 | deadurl=no}}</ref> The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac's novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\n\nGinsberg's principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked&nbsp;...\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco's [[City Lights Bookstore]], it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a [[wikt:cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre|cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] among defenders of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value.<ref name=\"Miles\" /> Ginsberg and [[Shig Murao]], the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends.<ref>Ball, Gordon, \"'Howl' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights' Shig Murao,\" ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' 11/28/99.</ref>\n\n====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\nGinsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's ''Duluoz Legend''). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg's experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother, \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsberg's life. He begins the poem with \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\", which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature.<ref name=Raskin /> This madness was the \"angry fix\" that society needed to function&nbsp;\u2014 madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on \"Carl Solomon! I'm with you in Rockland\", and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his \"straightjacket\". Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\n\n===To Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\", Tangier and India===\nIn 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in [[Morocco]], he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue G\u00eet-le-Coeur that was to become known as the [[Beat Hotel]]. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg began his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed ''Bomb'' and ''Marriage'', and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer [[Harold Chapman]], who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962\u20131963, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) and Benares (Varanasi). Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young [[Bengalis|Bengali]] poets of the time including [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]] and [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]]. Ginsberg had several political connections in India; most notably [[Pupul Jayakar]] who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him.\n\n===England and the International Poetry Incarnation===\nIn May 1965, Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Nuttall, J (1968) ''Bomb Culture'' MacGibbon & Kee, {{ISBN|0-261-62617-5}}</ref> Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at [[Better Books]], which was described by [[Jeff Nuttall]] as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind\".<ref name=\"Ref-1\" /> [[Thomas McGrath (poet)|Tom McGrath]] wrote: \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England&nbsp;\u2014 or at least in the history of English Poetry\".<ref name=\"Ref-2\">Fountain, N: ''Underground: the London alternative press, 1966\u20131974'' page 16. [[Taylor & Francis]], 1988 {{ISBN|0-415-00728-3}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the [[International Poetry Incarnation]],<ref name=\"Ref-2\" /> which was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, [[Adrian Mitchell]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Harry Fainlight]], [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Christopher Logue]], [[George MacBeth]], Gregory Corso, [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Simon Vinkenoog]], [[Spike Hawkins]] and [[Thomas McGrath (poet)|Tom McGrath]]. The event was organized by Ginsberg's friend, the filmmaker [[Barbara Rubin]].<ref name=\"ginsbergproject\">{{cite web|last1=Hale|first1=Peter|title=Barbara Rubin (1945\u20131980)|url=http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/barbara-rubin-1945-1980.html|website=The Allen Ginsberg Project}}</ref><ref name=\"osterweil\">{{cite web|last1=Osterweil|first1=Ara|title=Queer Coupling, or The Stain of the Bearded Woman|date=2010|url=http://www.araosterweil.com/download/i/mark_dl/u/4009891857/4561222908/Framework%2051-2.1%20Osterweil%20article.pdf|website=araosterweil.com|publisher=Wayne State University Press}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]] documented the event on film and released it as ''[[Wholly Communion]]''. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.\n\n===Continuing literary activity===\n[[File:Allen Ginsberg und Peter Orlowski ArM.jpg|thumb|250px|Ginsberg with his partner, poet [[Peter Orlovsky]]. Photo taken in 1978]]\nThough the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: [[David Amram]], [[Bob Kaufman]]; [[Diane di Prima]]; [[Jim Cohn]]; poets associated with the [[Black Mountain College]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Denise Levertov]]; poets associated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] such as [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Kenneth Koch]]. LeRoi Jones before he became [[Amiri Baraka]], who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper.

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law.<ref name=Raskin>Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg's \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004).</ref> Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem's depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.<ref name=Raskin /> The sex that Ginsberg described did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even longtime lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex.<ref name=Raskin /> For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues. Ginsberg's publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges, because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\",<ref name=Morgan>Morgan, Bill (ed.) (2006) ''\"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression''. California: City of Lights.</ref> thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970\u20131996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with [[PEN American Center]] with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to [[Herbert Huncke]]: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.<ref name=Deliberate>Ginsberg, Allen.

Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself \"mountains of homosexuality.\" He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2017/01/09/lgbt-history-not-just-west-village-bars/|title=LGBT History: Not Just West Village Bars|website=gvshp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref> He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing [[Peter Orlovsky]], his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his [[Who's Who]] entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor.<ref name=\"Deliberate\" />\n\nIn writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challenged&nbsp;\u2014 and ultimately changed&nbsp;\u2014 obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws ([[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Lenny Bruce]], for example).\n\n===Association with NAMBLA===\nGinsberg was a supporter and member of [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), a [[pedophilia]] and [[pederasty]] advocacy organization in the United States that works to abolish age of consent laws and legalize sexual relations between adults and children,<ref name=\"PedIJN\">{{citation |title=Allen Ginsberg's advocacy of pedophilia debated in community |first=Andrea |last=Jacobs |year=2002|work=Intermountain Jewish News}}</ref> saying that \"Attacks on NAMBLA stink of politics, witchhunting for profit, humorlessness, vanity, anger and ignorance&nbsp;...

He organized the New York City chapter of LeMar (Legalize Marijuana).<ref>Fisher, Marc (February 22, 2014).

His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously. In 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Soon after, he wrote \"Howl\", the poem that brought him and his [[Beat Generation]] contemporaries to national attention and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at [[Brooklyn College]] from 1986 until his death.<ref>Lawlor, William. ''Beat culture : lifestyles, icons, and impact''. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2005. Print.</ref>\n\n===Inspiration from friends===\nGinsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of \"[[spontaneous prose]]\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nThe inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg's friend, [[Carl Solomon]], and \"Howl\" is dedicated to him. Solomon was a [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to [[Artaud]]) who suffered bouts of [[clinical depression]]. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a [[lobotomy]]. The institution refused, giving him many forms of [[psychotherapy|therapy]], including [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]]. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\n\nGinsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"[[Moloch]]\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a [[Semitic gods|Levantine god]] to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the [[Kenneth Rexroth]] poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, [[Dylan Thomas]]. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the [[Torah]] and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are frequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by [[peyote]] visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and of the woodcut novels of [[Lynd Ward]].<ref>Ginsberg, Allen (1986) ''Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions,'' Barry Miles (ed.). New York: Harper. pp. 139\u2013140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages.</ref> Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post-World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.<ref name=\"Miles\" />\n\nHe also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of humanity in multiple aspects, in that the decision to ''defy'' socially created systems of control&nbsp;\u2014 and therefore go against Moloch&nbsp;\u2014 is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally fucked\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959's \"Kaddish\",<ref name=\"Miles\" /> which had its first public reading at a [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Worker]] Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with [[Thomas Merton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catholicworker.com/peacetc.htm |title=Catholic Worker Pacifism: An Eyewitness to History | last1=Cornell|first1=Tom |authorlink=Tom Cornell |website=Catholic Worker Homepage|access-date=May 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317165844/http://www.catholicworker.com/peacetc.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Inspiration from mentors and idols===\nGinsberg's poetry was strongly influenced by [[Modernism]] (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), [[Romanticism]] (specifically William Blake and [[John Keats]]), the beat and cadence of [[jazz]] (specifically that of [[Bebop|bop]] musicians such as [[Charlie Parker]]), and his [[Kagyu]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]]. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its [[New World]] exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=\"Deliberate\" /><ref name=Spontaneous />\n\nHe corresponded with William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem [[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]] about the industrial city near his home. After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like \"thee.\" Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, \"In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.\"<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=\"Deliberate\" /><ref name=\"Spontaneous\" />\n\nThough he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg's letter. He included the letter in a later part of ''Paterson''. He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include ''Bricklayer's Lunch Hour'' and ''Dream Record''.<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=\"Spontaneous\" />\n\nCarl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (''To Have Done with the Judgement of God'' and ''Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society''), and Jean Genet (''Our Lady of the Flowers''). [[Philip Lamantia]] introduced him to other [[Surrealists]] and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]'s ''Free Union''). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of \"Howl\" and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as ''Jubilate Agno''. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: [[Franz Kafka]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and even [[Emily Dickinson]].<ref name=\"Miles\" /><ref name=\"Deliberate\" />\n\nGinsberg also made an intense study of [[haiku]] and the paintings of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the ''Eyeball Kick''. He noticed in viewing C\u00e9zanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would [[Saccade|spasm]], or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a [[song cycle]] composed by [[Philip Glass]] with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems). Another example is Ginsberg's observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan's hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/dec/30/artsfeatures.bobdylan |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A lot of nerve | date=December 30, 1999 | access-date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> opiates,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/the_ten_most_incomprehensible.html |title=The Ten Most Incomprehensible Bob Dylan Interviews of All Time&nbsp;\u2014 Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date=October 4, 2007 |access-date=October 31, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127162320/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/the_ten_most_incomprehensible.html |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> alcohol,<ref>{{cite web|last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1855/ |title=Bob Dylan&nbsp;\u2014 By David Plotz&nbsp;\u2014 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=March 8, 1998 |access-date=October 31, 2010}}</ref> and psychedelics,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/mar/25/features.review7 |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Well, how does it feel? | date=March 25, 2001 | access-date=April 23, 2010 | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan}}</ref> as a ''[[Dexedrine]] Clown''.

He frequently included music in his poetry, invariably composing his tunes on an old Indian harmonium, which he often played during his readings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://folkways.si.edu/allen-ginsberg/first-blues-rags-ballads-and-harmonium-songs/american-folk-poetry/album/smithsonian|title=First Blues: Rags, Ballads and Harmonium Songs {{!}} Smithsonian Folkways|website=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> He wrote and recorded music to accompany William Blake's ''Songs of Innocence'' and ''Songs of Experience''.

In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of [[William Carlos Williams]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of ''The Fall of America.''{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections.

[[J. D.

The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of [[rational number]]s is not algebraically closed. Also, no [[finite field]] ''F'' is algebraically closed, because if ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a<sub>n</sub>'' are the elements of ''F'', then the polynomial (''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>)(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1\nhas no zero in ''F''. By contrast, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the field of [[complex number]]s is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) [[algebraic number]]s.\n\n==Equivalent properties==\nGiven a field ''F'', the assertion \"''F'' is algebraically closed\" is equivalent to other assertions:\n\n===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if the only [[irreducible polynomial]]s in the [[polynomial ring]] ''F''[''x''] are those of degree one.\n\nThe assertion \"the polynomials of degree one are irreducible\" is trivially true for any field. If ''F'' is algebraically closed and ''p''(''x'') is an irreducible polynomial of ''F''[''x''], then it has some root ''a'' and therefore ''p''(''x'') is a multiple of ''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, this means that ''p''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''), for some ''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}. On the other hand, if ''F'' is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial ''p''(''x'') in ''F''[''x''] without roots in ''F''. Let ''q''(''x'') be some irreducible factor of ''p''(''x''). Since ''p''(''x'') has no roots in ''F'', ''q''(''x'') also has no roots in ''F''. Therefore, ''q''(''x'') has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in ''F''.\n\n===Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial ''p''(''x'') of degree ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1, with [[coefficient]]s in ''F'', [[factorization|splits into linear factors]]. In other words, there are elements ''k'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''x<sub>n</sub>'' of the field ''F'' such that ''p''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>)(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x<sub>n</sub>'').\n\nIf ''F'' has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in ''F''[''x''] has some root in ''F''; in other words, ''F'' is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for ''F'' if ''F'' is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field ''K'', any polynomial in ''K''[''x''] can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.\n\n===Polynomials of prime degree have roots===\nJ. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over ''F'' of prime degree has a root in ''F'', then every non-constant polynomial has a root in ''F'', thus ''F'' is algebraically closed.\n\n===The field has no proper algebraic extension===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper [[algebraic extension]].\n\nIf ''F'' has no proper algebraic extension, let ''p''(''x'') be some irreducible polynomial in ''F''[''x'']. Then the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of ''F''[''x''] modulo the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''p''(''x'') is an algebraic extension of ''F'' whose [[degree of a field extension|degree]] is equal to the degree of ''p''(''x''). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of ''p''(''x'') is&nbsp;1.\n\nOn the other hand, if ''F'' has some proper algebraic extension ''K'', then the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] of an element in ''K''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''F'' is irreducible and its degree is greater than&nbsp;1.\n\n===The field has no proper finite extension===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite [[algebraic extension]] because if, within the [[Algebraically closed field#The field has no proper algebraic extension|previous proof]], the word \"algebraic\" is replaced by the word \"finite\", then the proof is still valid.\n\n===Every endomorphism of ''F<sup>n</sup>'' has some eigenvector===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number ''n'', every [[linear map]] from ''F<sup>n</sup>'' into itself has some [[eigenvector]].\n\nAn [[endomorphism]] of ''F<sup>n</sup>'' has an eigenvector if and only if its [[characteristic polynomial]] has some root. Therefore, when ''F'' is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of ''F<sup>n</sup>'' has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of ''F<sup>n</sup>'' has an eigenvector, let ''p''(''x'') be an element of ''F''[''x'']. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial ''q''(''x'') which has roots if and only if ''p''(''x'') has roots. But if ''q''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x<sup>n</sup>''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>''x''<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>+&nbsp;\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>0</sub>, then ''q''(''x'') is the characteristic polynomial of the ''n\u00d7n'' [[companion matrix]]\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&\\cdots&0&-a_0\\\\1&0&\\cdots&0&-a_1\\\\0&1&\\cdots&0&-a_2\\\\\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\0&0&\\cdots&1&-a_{n-1}\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===Decomposition of rational expressions===\nThe field ''F'' is algebraically closed if and only if every [[rational function]] in one variable ''x'', with coefficients in ''F'', can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''b'')<sup>n</sup>, where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''F''.\n\nIf ''F'' is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in ''F''[''x''] are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the [[Partial fraction decomposition#Statement of theorem|theorem on partial fraction decomposition]].\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field ''F''. Let ''p''(''x'') be an irreducible element in ''F''[''x'']. Then the rational function 1/''p'' can be written as the sum of a polynomial function ''q'' with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''b'')<sup>n</sup>. Therefore, the rational expression\n:<math>\\frac1{p(x)}-q(x)=\\frac{1-p(x)q(x)}{p(x)}</math>\ncan be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since ''p''(''x'') is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.\n\n===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===\nFor any field ''F'', if two polynomials ''p''(''x''),''q''(''x'')&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F''[''x''] are [[coprime|relatively prime]] then they do not have a common root, for if ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''F'' was a common root, then&nbsp;''p''(''x'') and &nbsp;''q''(''x'') would both be multiples of ''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a'' and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.\n\nIf the field ''F'' is algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'') be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let ''r''(''x'') be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then, since ''r''(''x'') is not constant, it will have some root ''a'', which will be then a common root of ''p''(''x'') and ''q''(''x'').\n\nIf ''F'' is not algebraically closed, let ''p''(''x'') be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then ''p''(''x'') and ''p''(''x'') are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).\n\n==Other properties==\nIf ''F'' is an algebraically closed field and ''n'' is a natural number, then ''F'' contains all ''n''th roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the ''n'' (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial ''x<sup>n</sup>''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a ''cyclotomic extension'', and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its ''cyclotomic closure''. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form ''x<sup>n</sup>''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a'' splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.\n\nIf a proposition which can be expressed in the language of [[first-order logic]] is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic&nbsp;0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic&nbsp;0, but there is some natural number ''N'' such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic&nbsp;''p'' when ''p''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''N''.<ref>See subsections ''Rings and fields'' and ''Properties of mathematical theories'' in \u00a72 of J. Barwise's \"An introduction to first-order logic\".</ref>\n\nEvery field ''F'' has some extension which is algebraically closed. Such an extension is called an '''algebraically closed extension'''. Among all such extensions there is one and only one ([[Up to|up to isomorphism]], but not [[essentially unique|unique isomorphism]]) which is an [[algebraic extension]] of ''F'';<ref>See Lang's ''Algebra'', \u00a7VII.2 or van der Waerden's ''Algebra I'', \u00a710.1.</ref> it is called the [[algebraic closure]] of ''F''.\n\nThe theory of algebraically closed fields has [[quantifier elimination]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last = Barwise | first = Jon | author-link = Jon Barwise | year = 1978 | contribution = An introduction to first-order logic | editor-last = Barwise | editor-first = Jon | title = Handbook of Mathematical Logic | series = Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics | publisher = North Holland | isbn = 0-7204-2285-X}}\n* {{Lang Algebra}}\n* {{citation|last = Shipman|first = Joseph|year = 2007|title = Improving the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra|periodical = Mathematical Intelligencer|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 9\u201314|doi=10.1007/BF02986170|issn = 0343-6993}}\n* {{Citation | last = van der Waerden | first = Bartel Leendert | author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden | title = Algebra | volume = I | edition = 7th | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 0-387-40624-7}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Algebraically Closed Field}}\n[[Category:Field theory]]", "sha1": "b9ze2rgv7j9f4xjv6vbaukik4rkowgx"}}, {"title": "August 6", "ns": "0", "id": "1019", "revision": {"id": "859452235", "parentid": "859452094", "timestamp": "2018-09-14T04:10:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "EclipseDude", "id": "34455661"}, "comment": "Reverted 2 pending edits by [[Special:Contributions/103.48.64.62|103.48.64.62]] to revision 859415743 by Neel.arunabh: No indication of notability;

He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by [[Garry Kasparov]]. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming [[FIDE]] World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history|greatest players in history]].\n\nHis tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes.<ref>{{cite web | first=Eric | last=van Reem | title=Karpov, Kortchnoi win Unzicker Gala | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2569 | publisher=[[ChessBase]].com | date=August 11, 2005 | accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref><ref>However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100.</ref> He had a peak [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2780, and his 102 total months at world number one is the [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|second longest of all-time]], behind only [[Garry Kasparov]], since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\n\n==Early life==\nKarpov was born on May 23, 1951<ref>How Karpov Wins, p. xiii</ref><ref>Deep Blue: An Artificial Intelligence Milestone, p. 44</ref><ref>Chess Life & Review, Volume 33. p. 539</ref> at [[Zlatoust]] in the [[Urals]] region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of 4. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a [[Candidate Master]] by age 11. At 12, he was accepted into [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?user=KingG|title=Anatoly Karpov's Best Games}}</ref> Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently.<ref name=\"KarpovOnKarpov\">{{cite book | title=Karpov on Karpov: A Memoirs of a Chess World Champion | author=Karpov, A. | publisher=Atheneum | year=1992 | isbn=0-689-12060-5}}</ref> Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by [[Boris Spassky]] in 1952.\n\n==International career==\n\n===Young master===\n[[File:Anatoly Karpov (1967).jpg|thumb|Karpov in 1967]]\nKarpov finished first in his first international tournament in [[T\u0159inec]] several months later, ahead of [[Viktor Kupreichik]].

He later transferred to [[Leningrad State University]], eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster [[Semyon Furman]], who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\n\nIn 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Wch_U20_fin-A_1969/26788 |title=Wch U20 fin-A 1969 \u2013 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in [[Caracas]], Venezuela,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Caracas_1970/22885 |title=Caracas 1970 \u2013 365Chess.com Tournaments |publisher=365chess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}</ref> and was awarded the [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] title.\n\n===Top-Class Grandmaster===\nHe won the 1971 [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] Memorial in Moscow (equal with [[Leonid Stein]]), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the [[USSR Chess Championship]], and finished equal first with [[Viktor Korchnoi]] in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament. The latter success qualified him for the 1974 [[Candidates Matches]], which would determine the challenger to the reigning world champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].\n\n===Candidate===\nKarpov defeated [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by the score of +3=5 in the first Candidates' match, earning the right to face former champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the semifinal round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates' cycle in 1977.\nSpassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4\u22121=6.\nThe Candidates' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the [[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Dragon]], then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive [[draw (chess)|draws]], Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3\u20130 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long [[chess endgame|endgame]], then notched a speedy victory after a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last [[draw by agreement|agreed]] by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3\u22122=19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.\n\n===Match with Fischer in 1975===\nThough a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins ([[draw (chess)|draws]] not counting), but also that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9\u20139. [[FIDE]], the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and after Fischer's resignation of the championship on June 27, 1975, FIDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.\n[[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.<ref>''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''</ref> Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.<ref>In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: \"I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch.\"</ref>\n\n===World champion===<!-- This section is linked from [[World Chess Championship]] -->\nDetermined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong [[Milan]] tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (9) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14). As a result, most chess professionals soon agreed that Karpov was a legitimate world champion.<ref name=\"WinningChessStrategies\">{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Strategies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443851}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973\u20131975 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at [[Baguio]], Philippines, with the winner needing six victories.\nAs in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match. When the score was +5\u22122=20 in Karpov's favour, Korchnoi staged a comeback, and won three of the next four games to draw level with Karpov. However, Karpov won the very next game to retain the title (+6\u22125=21).\n\nThree years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates' winner against German finalist Dr. [[Robert H\u00fcbner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Merano]], Italy. This match, however, was won handily by Karpov, the score being 11\u20137 (+6\u22122=10) in what is remembered as the \"Massacre in Merano\".\n\nKarpov's tournament career reached a peak at the [[Montreal]] \"Tournament of Stars\" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7\u22121=10) with [[Mikhail Tal]], ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevi\u0107]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vlastimil Hort]], [[Lajos Portisch]], Robert H\u00fcbner, [[Bent Larsen]] and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. He dominated [[Las Palmas]] 1977 with 13\u00bd/15. He also won the prestigious [[Bugojno]] tournament in 1978 (shared), 1980 and 1986, the [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (shared with [[Larry Christiansen]]) and 1994, the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976, 1983, and 1988.\n\nKarpov represented the Soviet Union at six [[Chess Olympiads]], in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at [[20th Chess Olympiad|Skopje 1972]], winning the board prize with 13/15. At [[21st Chess Olympiad|Nice 1974]], he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At [[24th Chess Olympiad|La Valletta 1980]], he was again board one and scored 9/12. At [[25th Chess Olympiad|Lucerne 1982]], he scored 6\u00bd/8 on board one. At [[27th Chess Olympiad|Dubai 1986]], he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was [[28th Chess Olympiad|Thessaloniki 1988]], where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.\n\nTo illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11\u22122=20 versus Spassky, +5=12 versus [[Robert H\u00fcbner]], +6\u22121=16 versus [[Ulf Andersson]], +3\u22121=10 versus [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1=16 versus [[Mikhail Tal]], +10\u22122=13 versus Ljubojevi\u0107.\n\nKarpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion by the time [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first match, the [[World Chess Championship 1984]] in Moscow, the first player to win six games would win the match. Karpov built a 4\u20130 lead after nine games. The next seventeen games were drawn, setting a record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President [[Florencio Campomanes]] unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players.<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov\u2013Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and forty draws.\n\nA rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, with a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12\u201312). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13\u201311 (+3\u22125=16), in favour of Kasparov.\n\n===Rivalry with Kasparov===\nKarpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world No. 2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (held in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (held in New York City and [[Lyon]]). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11\u00bd\u201312\u00bd (+4\u22125=15), 12\u201312 (+4\u22124=16), and 11\u00bd\u201312\u00bd (+3\u22124=17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.\n\nIn their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\n\nKarpov is on record saying that if he had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.\n\n===FIDE champion again (1993\u20131999)===\n[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|thumb|Karpov in 1996]]\nIn 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]]. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov defeated Timman \u2013 the loser of the Candidates' final against Short.\n\nThe next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 [[Linares chess tournament]]. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Jo\u00ebl Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polg\u00e1r]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]; with an average [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2685, the highest ever at that time. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament|San Remo in 1930]]), finishing 2\u00bd points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest [[Performance rating (chess)|performance rating]] of any player in history up until 2009, when [[Magnus Carlsen]] won the category XXI [[Pearl Spring chess tournament]] with a performance of 3002. However, chess statistician [[Jeff Sonas]] considered Karpov's Linares performance to be the best tournament result in history.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5828 Facts and figures: Magnus Carlsen's performance in Nanjing]. ChessBase.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-26.</ref>\n\nKarpov defended his FIDE title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6\u22123=9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates' Matches, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]], champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]] (+2\u22122=2, rapid tiebreak 2\u20130). In the subsequent cycle, the format was changed, with the champion having to qualify. Karpov refused to defend his title, and ceased to be FIDE World Champion after the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999]].\n\n===Towards retirement===\nKarpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1997, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the September 2009 FIDE rating list, he dropped out of the world's Top 100 for the first time.\n\nKarpov usually limits his play to exhibition events, and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess. In 2002 he won a match against Kasparov, defeating him in a rapid time control match 2\u00bd\u20131\u00bd.

As an example, 8:5, 16:10, 1.6:1, {{Frac|8|5}} and 1.6 are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio.\n\nIn objects of more than two dimensions, such as [[hyperrectangle]]s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side.\n\n==Applications and uses==\nThe term is most commonly used with reference to:\n* Graphic / image\n** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]\n** [[Display aspect ratio]]: the aspect ratio for computer displays.\n** [[Paper size]]\n** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]\n** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]]\n** [[Standard ad size]]\n** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]\n** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.\n*** [[HARMST]] High Aspect Ratios allow the construction of tall structures without slant\n* [[Tire code]]\n* [[Tire sizing]]\n* [[Aspect ratio (wing)|Wing aspect ratio]] of an aircraft or bird\n* [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]] of an [[optical lens]]\n* Nanorod dimensions\n* [[Shape factor (image analysis and microscopy)]]\n\n==Aspect ratios of simple shapes==\n\n===Rectangles===\n{{Main article|Aspect ratio (image)}}\nFor a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle.

A circle has the minimal DWAR which is 1. A square has a DWAR of sqrt(2).\n* The cube-volume aspect ratio (CVAR) of a compact set is the d-th root of the ratio of the d-volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel d-cube, to the set's own d-volume. A square has the minimal CVAR which is 1. A circle has a CVAR of sqrt(2). An axis-parallel rectangle of width W and height H, where W>H, has a CVAR of sqrt(W^2/WH) = sqrt(W/H).\n\nIf the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.\n\n==Notations==\nAspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced \"x-to-y\").\n\nCinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height.

Races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively [[Classic trials|reliability trials]], aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s, specialist racing cars had developed.\n \nThere are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of auto racing}}\n\nThe first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Old Trafford]], a distance of eight miles. It was won by the carriage of [[Isaac Watt Boulton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Isaac_Watt_Boulton|title=Isaac Watt Boulton|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref>\n\nInternal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful [[gasoline]]-fueled automobiles.

The first NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].\n\nFrom 1962, sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars, with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.<ref>Denis Jenkinson, Automobile Year Book Of Sports Car Racing, 1982</ref>\n\nFrom 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] cigarette brand [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's \"modern era\".\n\nThe IMSA GT Series evolved into the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran its first season in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perez|first=A.J.|title=Le Mans series showcases prototype race cars|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2007-08-29-lemans-motor_N.htm|accessdate=August 20, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=August 30, 2007}}</ref> The European races eventually became the closely related [[Le Mans Series]], both of which mix prototypes and GTs.\n\nTurismo Carretera (Road racing, lit., Road Touring) is a popular touring car racing series in Argentina, and the oldest car racing series still active in the world.\nThe first TC competition took place in 1937 with 12 races, each in a different province. Future Formula One star Juan Manuel Fangio (Chevrolet) won the 1940 and 1941 editions of the TC. It was during this time that the series' Chevrolet-Ford rivalry began, with Ford acquiring most of its historical victories.\n\n==Categories==\n===Open-wheel racing===\n{{Main|Formula racing|Open wheel car}}\n[[File:Giedo van der Garde 2013 Malaysia FP1.jpg|thumb|[[Giedo van der Garde]] driving the [[Caterham CT03]] at [[Sepang International Circuit]]]]\n\nThe two most popular varieties of open wheel [[road racing]] are [[Formula One]] and the [[IndyCar Series]].\n\nFormula One is a European-based series that runs only [[street circuit]] and [[race track]]s. These cars are heavily based around technology and their aerodynamics. With the highest speed record set in 2005 by Juan Pablo Montoya hitting 373 kph (232&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/fastest-f1-records|title=Blink and you\u2019ll miss these F1 records|work=Red Bull|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}</ref> Some of the most prominent races are the Monaco Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, and the British Grand Prix. The season ends with the crowning of the World Championship for drivers and constructors.\n\nIn single-seater ([[open-wheel]]), the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce [[downforce]] and enhance adhesion to the track. In Europe and Asia, open-wheeled racing is commonly referred to as \"Formula\", with appropriate hierarchical suffixes. In North America, the \"Formula\" terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1). The sport is usually arranged to follow an international format (such as F1), a regional format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), and/or a domestic, or country-specific, format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).\n\n[[File:JLazierIndy07.jpg|thumb|left|A Panoz GF09 Indycar Series chassis driven by [[Jaques Lazier]] during practice for the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\nIn the United States, the most popular series is the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]], more commonly known as the IndyCar Series and previously known as [[Champ Car|CART]]). The cars have traditionally been similar though less technologically sophisticated than [[F1 cars]], with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs. While these cars are not as technologically advanced, they are faster, mainly because they compete on oval race tracks, being able to average a lap at 388 kph (241&nbsp;mph). The series' biggest race is the [[Indianapolis 500]], which is commonly referred to as \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single-day sporting event (350,000+).\n\n[[File:Formel3 racing car amk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Formula Three]] car racing at the [[Hockenheimring]], 2008]]\n\nThe other major international single-seater racing series is [[Formula Two|Formula 2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[GP2 Series]]). Regional series include [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Formula V6 Asia]] (specifically in Asia), [[Formula Renault 3.5]] (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of [[World Series by Nissan]]), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Palmer Audi]] and [[Formula Atlantic]]. In 2009, the [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific, series include Formula Three and Formula Renault, with the leading introductory series being [[Formula Ford]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nSingle-seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There exist many amateur racing clubs. In the UK, the major club series are the [[Monoposto Racing Club]], BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford. Each series caters for a section of the market, with some primarily providing low-cost racing, while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).\n\nThere are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts. [[Formula Ford]] represents the most popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts. The series is still the preferred option, as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The [[Star Mazda Series]] is another entry-level series.\n\n[[File:URE05e.jpg|thumb|left| The full electric [[Formula Student]]/[[Formula SAE]] car of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]]]\n\nStudents at colleges and universities can also take part in single-seater racing through the [[Formula SAE]] competition, which involves designing and building a single-seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills, such as teamwork, while promoting motorsport and engineering.\n\nThe world's first all-female Formula racing team was created in 2006. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an MTV reality pilot, which was shot at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].\n\n[[File:In Car Micheal Fitzgerald Cork Racing.jpg|thumb|Racing Drivers View.]]\nIn December 2005, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] gave approval to [[Superleague Formula]] racing, which debuted in 2008, whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]]\n\nAfter 25 years away from the sport, former [[Formula 2]] champion [[Jonathan Palmer]] reopened the F2 category again; most drivers have graduated from the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] series. The category is officially registered as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the [[FIA World Touring Car Championship]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Touring car racing===\n\n{{Main|Touring car racing}}\n\n[[File:2012 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 1) opening lap.jpg|thumb|Opening lap of [[2012 WTCC season|2012 WTCC]] Race of Japan]]\nTouring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production-derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.\n\nThe major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the [[Supercars Championship]] (Australia), [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), and the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. The [[European Touring Car Cup]] is a one-day event open to [[Super 2000]] specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.\n\nThe [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory-derived vehicles on various local circuits.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sports car racing===\n\n{{Main|Sports car racing}}\n\n[[File:2011 FIA GT1 Silverstone 2.jpg|thumb|[[FIA GT1 World Championship|FIA GT1]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in [[2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season|2011]]]]\n\nIn [[sports car racing]], production-derived versions of [[sports cars]], also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose-built [[sports prototype]] cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The premier championship series of sports car racing is the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The main series for GT car racing is the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]]. There is also the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] as well as the less powerful [[GT4 European Cup]]. Previously, an intermediate [[FIA GT2 European Championship]] existed, but the FIA dropped it to cut costs. Other major GT championships include the Japanese [[Super GT]] championship and the [[International GT Open]] for GT2 and GT3 cars. There are also national GT championships using mainly GT3 and GT4 cars featuring professional and amateur drivers alike.\n\n[[File:Audi R18 e-tron quattro at 2013 Le Mans.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Audi R18]], a [[Le Mans Prototype]] car, during an [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]]]]\nSports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road-legal cars as a base. They are closed-wheel and often closed-cockpit purpose-built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars, making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans (held annually since 1923) and in the (European) [[Le Mans series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]] and the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]. These cars are referred to as [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams. All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.\n\nAnother prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States; the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]], which began in 2000, sanctions its own endurance series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]], which consists of slower and lower-cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars. The [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[American Le Mans Series]] announced a merger between the two series forming the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] starting in 2014.\n\nThese races are often conducted over long distances, at least {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes, each fighting for their own championship.\n\nFamous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]], [[Spa 24 Hours|24 Hours of Spa]]-Franchorchamps, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]], and the {{convert|1000|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. There is also the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|24 Hours of the N\u00fcrburgring]] on the infamous Nordschleife track and the [[Dubai 24 Hour]], which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Production-car racing===\n\n{{Main|Production car racing}}\n\nProduction-car racing, otherwise known as \"showroom stock\" in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring-car racing, mainly used to restrict costs. Numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars.\n\nMost series follow the [[Group N]] regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that are run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s Firehawk Series, which ran in the 1980s and 1990s all over the United States.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===One-make racing===\n\n{{See also|One-Design|Spec racing}}\n\nOne-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer's range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[Porsche Supercup]] and, previously, [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]&nbsp;\u2013 have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the [http://www.mini7.co.uk Mini 7 Championship] (Europe's longest-running one make championship), the [[Radical European Masters]], [http://www.minichallenge.co.uk John Cooper Mini Challenge], [[Renault Clio Cup|Clio Cup]], [[Ginetta Cars|Ginettas]], [[Caterham Racing|Caterhams]], [[Kumho BMW Championship|BMWs]], and [[MaX5 Racing Championship|MX5s]].

NASCAR's premier series is the [[Monster Energy Cup Series]], its most famous races being the [[Daytona 500]], the [[Bojangles Southern 500|Southern 500]], the [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Brickyard 400]]. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the [[Xfinity Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] (a [[pickup truck]] racing series). The series conduct races across the entire [[continental United States]]. The [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]] conducts races across Canada and the [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]] conducts races across Mexico.\n\nNASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the [[Whelen Modified Tour]]. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after. A number of modified cars display a \"manufacturer's\" logo and \"vehicle name\", yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.\n[[File:BrettSontag2010LateModelRockfordSpeedway.jpg|left|thumb|An [[ASA Late Model Series]] stock car on an asphalt track.]]\nThere are also other stock car governing bodies, most notably the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] (ARCA).\n\nIn the UK, [[British Stock car racing]] is also referred to as \"Short Circuit Racing\". This takes place on shale or tarmac tracks&nbsp;\u2013 usually around 1/4&nbsp;mile long. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic divisions&nbsp;\u2013 distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing. The most famous championship is the [[BriSCA F1 Stock Cars]]. Full-contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers&nbsp;\u2013 and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight racing and Oval Racing.\n\nSemi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox&nbsp;\u2013 where bumpers are used tactically.\n\nNon-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods and Lightning Rods.\n\nUK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rallying===\n\n{{Main|Rallying}}\n\n[[File:Andreas Mikkelsen - WRC Portugal 2013 (8647047945).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Mikkelsen]] driving a [[Volkswagen Polo R WRC|VW Polo R WRC]] during the [[2013 Rally de Portugal]]]]\n\n[[Rallying]] at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] road-legal production-based cars; [[Group N]] production cars and more modified [[Group A]] cars. Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers \"rally\" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of \"special stages\" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as pace notes. During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.\n\nThe top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), first contested in 1973, but there are also regional championships, and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], [[Rally Argentina]], [[Rally Finland]] and [[Rally GB]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a [[rally raid]]) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]], conceived in 1978. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]], which are popular with amateurs, making up the \"grass roots\" of motor sports. Cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of [[group A]] or [[group N]] [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]].\nOther major rally events include the [[British Rally Championship]], [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]], [[African Rally Championship]], [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship]] and endurance rally events like the [[Dakar Rally]].\n\n[[File:Longford extreme slide 2.jpg|thumb|\"Der Panzerwagen\" at the 2010 [[Targa Tasmania]]]]\nThe [[Targa Tasmania]], held on the Australian island state of Tasmania and run annually since 1992, takes its name from the [[Targa Florio]], a former motoring event held on the island of [[Sicily]]. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the [[Mille Miglia]], the [[Coupe des Alpes]] and the [[Tour de Corse]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Similarly named events around the world include the [[Targa Newfoundland]] based in Canada, [[Targa West]] based in Western Australia, [[Targa New Zealand]] and other smaller events.\n\n===Drag racing===\n\n{{Main|Drag racing}}\n\n[[File:Tarlton-Drag racing-004.jpg|thumb|Jet-propelled [[drag racing|dragster]] in [[Tarlton, Gauteng|Tarlton]], [[South Africa]]]]\n\nIn drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally {{convert|1/4|mi|m}}, though {{convert|1/8|mi|m}} has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[drag racing|dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the \u00bc mile in 12 to 16&nbsp;seconds, whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] takes 4.5&nbsp;seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|530|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Drag racing was organized as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early 1950s through the [[NHRA]] (National Hot Rod Association). The NHRA was formed to discourage [[street racing]].\n\nWhen launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 [[g-force|g]] (33&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4&nbsp;g (39&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), more than the [[Space Shuttle]] experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over {{convert|8|mi|km}} away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://topfuel.nhra.com/blog/nhra-notebook/2007/07/26/22660/ | title=Herbert's engine thunders to 3.9 on Richter scale | date=July 26, 2007 | work=NHRA.com | accessdate=August 11, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<!-- Need more details to verify this reference:<ref>NHRA Mile High Nationals 2001, and 2002 testing from the National Seismology Center.</ref> -->\n\nDrag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index \"break out\" and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a [[Drag racing#Dial-in|dial-in]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Off-road racing===\n\n{{Main|Off-road racing}}\n\n[[File:Stockmini.jpg|thumb|[[Rod Hall (racer)|Rod Hall]] in a [[Hummer H3]] during a [[Best in the Desert]] race]]\n\nIn [[off-road racing]], various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]]. Another format for off-road racing happens on closed-course [[Short course off road racing|short course tracks]] such as [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, short course was extended to racing inside stadiums in the [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]]; this format was revived by [[Robby Gordon]] in 2013 with his [[Speed Energy Formula Off-Road]] series.\n\nIn Europe, \"offroad\" refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], Master Rallye or European \"bajas\" are called \"cross-country rallies.\"\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Kart racing===\n[[File:AtwaterSat394.jpg|thumb|A sprint kart race in Atwater California hosted by the International Karting Federation]]\n\n{{Main|Kart racing}}\nThe modern kart was invented by Art Ingels, a fabricator at the Indianapolis-car manufacturer Kurtis-Kraft, in Southern California in 1956. Ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube-frame chassis weighing less than 100&nbsp;lb. Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]]. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to race, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.\n\nDespite their diminutive size, karting's most powerful class, [[superkart]], can have a power-to-weight ratio of 440&nbsp;hp/tonne.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Historical racing===\n[[File:Monterey Historic.jpg|thumb|[[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], [[Monterey]], 2008]]\n\n{{Main|Historic motorsport}}\nAs modern motor racing is centered on modern technology with a lots of corporate sponsors and politics involved, [[historical racing]] tends to be the opposite. Because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented, reducing corporate sponsorship and politics. Events are regulated to only allow cars of a certain era to participate. The only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing. A historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines.\nNotably some of the most famous events of them all are the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] and [[Goodwood Revival]] in Britain and [[Monterey Historic]] in the United States. Championships range from \"grass root\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] racing to the [[FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship]] for classic [[Formula One]] chassis.\n\nWhile there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing, this branch of [[auto sport]] tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach.\n\n===Other categories===\n{{see also|Category:Auto racing by type}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Autocross]]\n* [[Autograss]]\n* [[Banger racing]]\n* [[Board track racing]]\n* [[Demolition derby]]\n* [[Dirt speedway racing]]\n* [[Dirt track racing]]\n* [[Drifting (motorsport)]]\n* [[Eco-Marathon]]\n* [[Folkrace]]\n* [[High Performance Drivers Education]]\n* [[Hillclimbing]]\n* [[Ice racing]]\n* [[Legends car racing]]\n* [[Midget car racing]]\n* [[Mini sprint|Mini Sprint]]\n* [[Monster truck]]\n* [[Mud bogging]]\n* [[Power Racing Series|Power Wheels Racing]]\n* [[Pickup truck racing]]\n* [[Rallycross]]\n* [[Road racing]]\n* [[Short track motor racing]]\n* [[Autocross|Slalom]]\n* [[Solar car racing]]\n* [[Sprint car racing]]\n* [[Swamp buggy|Swamp Buggy racing]]\n* [[Wheelstand Competition]]\n}}\n\n==Use of flags==\n\n{{Main|Racing flags}}\n\nIn many types of auto races, particularly those held on closed courses, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors.

Adjustments can occur in [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]], brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], engines, tires, and many others.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\nAerodynamics and airflow play big roles in the setup of a racecar. Aerodynamic downforce improves the race car's handling by lowering the center of gravity and distributing the weight of the car equally on each tire.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\">Adams, Eric, and Joe Brown. \"The Perfect Racecar.\" Popular Science 268.4 (2006): 50-51. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016.</ref> Once this is achieved, fuel consumption decreases and the forces against the car are significantly lowered. Many aerodynamic experiments are conducted in wind tunnels, to simulate real life situations while measuring the various drag forces on the car.<ref name=\"Diba, Fereydoon 2014\">Diba, Fereydoon, Ahmad Barari, and Ebrahim Esmailzadeh. \"Handling And Safety Enhancement Of Race Cars Using Active Aerodynamic Systems.\" Vehicle System Dynamics 52.9 (2014): 1171-1190. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.</ref> These \u201cRolling roads\u201d produce many wind situations and direct air flow at certain speeds and angles.<ref>Marston, Steve. \"Spectacles Of Speed: Modernity, Masculinity, And Auto Racing In Kansas, 1909-1918.\" Kansas History 38.3 (2015): 192-207. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.</ref> When a diffuser is installed under the car, the amount of drag force is significantly lowered, and the overall aerodynamics of the vehicle is positively adjusted.<ref name=\"Diba, Fereydoon 2014\"/> Wings and canards channel the airflow in the most efficient way to get the least amount of drag from the car. It is experimentally proven that downforce is gained and the vehicles handling is considerably changed when aerodynamic wings on the front and rear of the vehicle are installed.<ref name=\"Diba, Fereydoon 2014\"/>\n\n===Suspension===\nSuspension plays a huge part in giving the racecar the ability to be driven optimally. Shocks are mounted vertically or horizontally to prevent the body from rolling in the corners. The suspension is important because it makes the car stable and easier to control and keeps the tires on the road when driving on uneven terrain. It works in three different ways including vertically, longitudinally, and laterally to control movement when racing on various tracks.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/>\n\n===Tires===\nTires called R-Compounds are commonly used in motorsports for high amounts of traction. The soft rubber allows them to expand when they are heated up, making more surface area on the pavement, therefore producing the most amount of traction.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/> These types of tires do not have treads on them. Tire pressure is dependent on the temperature of the tire and track when racing. Each time a driver pulls into the pits, the tire pressure and temperature should be tested for optimal performance. When the tires get too hot they will swell or inflate and need to be deflated to the correct pressure.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/> When the tires are not warmed up they will not perform as well.\n\n===Brakes===\nBrakes on a race car are imperative in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and vehicle deceleration.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\">de Groot, S., et al. \"Car Racing In A Simulator: Validation And Assessment Of Brake Pedal Stiffness.\" Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments 20.1 (2011): 47-61. Academic Search Complete. Web. 7 Dec. 2016.</ref> Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\"/> Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes and they have not warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.<ref name=\"Groot, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Engine===\nThe race car's engine needs a considerable amount of air to produce maximum power. The air intake manifold sucks the air from scoops on the hood and front bumper and feeds it into the engine. Many engine modifications to increase horsepower and efficiency are commonly used in many racing sanctioning bodies.<ref name=\"Adams, Eric 2006\"/> Engines are tuned on a machine called a dynamometer that is commonly known in the racing world as a DYNO. The car is driven onto the DYNO and many gauges and sensors are hooked up to the car that are controlled on an online program to test force, torque, or power. Through the testing, the car's engine maps can be changed to get the most amount of horsepower and ultimately speed out of the vehicle.\n\n==Racing driver==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}\nRacing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by the team, or by sponsors, and can command very substantial salaries.\n\nContrary to what may be popularly assumed, racing drivers as a group do not have unusually better reflexes or [[reaction time|peripheral response time]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Memmert |first1=D |last2=Simons |first2=DJ |last3=Grimme |first3=T |title=The relationship between visual attention and expertise in sports |journal=Psychol Sport Exerc. |date=2009;10 |pages=146\u2013151}}</ref> During repeated physiological (and psychological) evaluations of professional racing drivers, the two characteristics that stand out are racers' near-obsessive need to control their surroundings (the psychological aspect), and an unusual ability to process fast-moving information (physiological).

In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person. It follows then that each person justly owns whatever previously unowned resources he appropriates or \"mixes his labor with\". From these twin axioms&nbsp;\u2013 self-ownership and \"homesteading\"&nbsp;\u2013 stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society.

Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\">Rothbard, Murray N.

The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military. However, others might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and\u2014as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression\u2014an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/>\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined anarchism, \"a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']\"; and said that \"what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N.

This ownership of \"originally appropriated\" places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit, provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke's phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary&nbsp;\u2013 contractual&nbsp;\u2013 transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.<ref name=\"Hoppe-2002\">Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html \"Rothbardian Ethics\"] Retrieved 23 May 2005</ref>}}\n{|class=\"box\" style=\"float:right; margin:15px; text-align:left; border:3px solid #aaa; padding:4px; font-size:85%; width:240px;\"\n|-\n||\nAnarcho-capitalism uses the following terms in ways that may differ from common usage or various anarchist movements.\n* Anarchism: any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (includes opposition to the state)\n* Contract: a voluntary binding agreement between persons\n* Coercion: physical force or threat of such against persons or property\n* Capitalism: economic system where the means of production are privately owned and where investments, production, distribution, income and prices are determined through the operation of a free market rather than by statutory regulation\n* Free market: a market where all decisions regarding transfer of money, goods (including capital goods) and services are voluntary\n* Fraud: inducing one to part with something of value through the use of dishonesty\n* State: an organization that taxes and engages in regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion\n* Voluntary: any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency\n|}\nThis is the root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]] and where they differ from [[collectivism|collectivist]] forms of anarchism such as [[anarcho-communism]], where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed \"according to need\" (which is to be determined and enforced collectively). Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. private) ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual \"needs\" or does not \"need\". As Rothbard says, \"if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made\". After property is transformed through labor, it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift\u2014forced transfers are considered illegitimate. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same \"absolute right\" as his own body. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it\u2014it is only by using land and by mixing one's labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized: \"Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be\". Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the person's property as \"for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\">Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) [https://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap2d.asp Ludwig von Mises Institute] ''[[Man, Economy & State]] with [[Power and Market]]'' [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] {{ISBN|978-0-945466-30-7}} ch. 2 Retrieved 19 May 2005.</ref> As a practical matter, in terms of the ownership of land anarcho-capitalists recognize that there are few (if any) parcels of land left on Earth whose ownership was not at some point in time obtained in violation of the homestead principle, through seizure by the state or put in private hands with the assistance of the state. Rothbard says: {{quote|It is not enough to call simply for defense of \"the rights of private property\"; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be \"private\" must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>}}\n\nRothbard says in ''Justice and Property Right'' that \"any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property\". In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases \"the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed\". He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the \"homestead principle\". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector, saying that \"any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible\". For example, he proposes that [[State university|state universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally \"private property\" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says: \"What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not 'private' property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property\". Likewise, Karl Hess says that \"libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private [...] Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system\".<ref>Hess, Karl (1969) ''[https://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle: {{quote|For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, rape, trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the ethics of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.<ref name=\"Hoppe-2002\"/>}}\n\n==== Common property ====\nAlthough anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers and portions of oceans.<ref name=\"Holcombe\">Holcombe, Randall G., [https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3\u201329.</ref> Anarchist theorist [[Roderick T. Long]] gives the following example: {{quote|Consider a village near a lake. It is common for the villagers to walk down to the lake to go fishing. In the early days of the community it's hard to get to the lake because of all the bushes and fallen branches in the way. But over time the way is cleared and a path forms&nbsp;\u2013 not through any coordinated efforts, but simply as a result of all the individuals walking by that way day after day. The cleared path is the product of labor&nbsp;\u2013 not any individual's labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.<ref>Long, Roderick T. 199. \"A Plea for Public Property\". ''Formulations'' 5, no. 3 (Spring)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, since property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership to the extent of the number of owners\u2014and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely\u2014anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]] and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. However, in some cases they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free market environmentalists]] regarding the environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements. Air, water and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. Central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit \"the many\" and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many politicians for [[job creation]] within a political territory.<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/>\n\n=== Economics ===\nThe [[Austrian School]] of economics argued against the viability of socialism and centrally planned economic policy. [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], a colleague of Austrian school founder [[Carl Menger]], wrote one of the first critiques of socialism in his treatise ''The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism''. Later, [[Friedrich von Hayek]] wrote ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944), which states that a [[command economy]] lacks the information function of market prices and that central authority over the economy leads to [[totalitarianism]]. Another Austrian economist, [[Ludwig von Mises]], wrote ''[[Human Action]]'', an early exposition of the method he called [[praxeology]].\n\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926\u20131995) coined the word anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating \"private property anarchism\" in 1949 and later came up with the alternative name \"anarcho-capitalism\". He was probably the first to use \"libertarian\" in its current United States pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-[[Statism|statist]] and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling-out. When interventionist [[Cold War]]riors of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican Party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing [[antiwar]] groups. He believed that the Cold Warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to [[Trotskyist]] theory.<ref name=\"Rothbard\">Rothbard, Murray N. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard16.html LewRockwell.com]. Retrieved 10 September 2006.</ref> Rothbard opposed the founding of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.\n\n=== Contractual society ===\n[[File:Althing-stamp.jpg|thumb|A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the Icelandic parliament\u2014according to a theory associated with the economist [[David D. Friedman]], medieval Icelandic society had some features of anarcho-capitalism; chieftaincies could be bought and sold and were not geographical monopolies; and individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan]]\nThe society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the \"contractual society\"\u2014i.e. \"a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence\"<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements (contracts) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.\n\nOne particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]\u2014another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.\n\nRothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society as they are simply the pooling of capital. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: \"Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> However, corporations created in this way would not be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that \"limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy & State with Power and Market, [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]</ref>\n\nThere are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/> and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will and which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.<ref name=\"Nozick-1973\">[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''</ref>\n\nIncluded in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, [[David D. Friedman]] has expressed preference for a society where \"almost everyone is self-employed\" and \"instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces\".<ref>Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.\n\n=== Law and order and the use of violence ===\nDifferent anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Morris and Linda Tannehill object to any [[statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]] and contract law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.<ref>Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.</ref> However, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, Rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.\n\nUnlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of ethics and [[morality]] as a requirement, David D. Friedman proposes that \"the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars\".<ref name=\"koltwm\">Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116\u201317.</ref> Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society \"remains to be proven\". He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs, but he thinks this would be rare.

However, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation, but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force\u2014that is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. If competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists.

The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.<ref>O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf \"Retribution versus Restitution\"] Legal Notes No. 5, Libertarian Alliance {{ISBN|978-1-870614-22-1}} Retrieved 19 May 2005</ref>\n\n[[Bruce L. Benson]] argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, \"standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235\u201338|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}</ref> The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. However, the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record.

Many anarcho-capitalists admire the [[American Revolution]] as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties. In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N.

Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\">Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56</ref> Unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on \"[[market failure]]\", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see [[government failure]]) to compare the net result, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.<ref name=\"Friedman-1973\"/>\n\nKosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of statutory law the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace. For him, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form.<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/>\n\n== Anarcho-capitalism and other anarchist schools ==\n[[File:Flag of Anarcho-capitalism.svg|thumb|The black and gold flag, symbol of anarchism (black) and capitalism (gold), was first flown in 1963 in Colorado<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]], ''[https://mises.org/library/betrayal-american-right-0 The Betrayal of the American Right]'' (2007): 188</ref> and is also used by the Swedish ''AnarkoKapitalistisk Front''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/se-pol.html#akf|title=Flags of political parties (Sweden)|publisher=FOTW Flags Of The World website|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>]]\nIn both its [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] forms, anarchism is usually considered a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideology that promotes socialist economic theories such as [[communism]], [[syndicalism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].<ref name=brooks>{{cite book |quote=Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism, from the hyperrationalism of Godwin, to the egoism of Stirner, to the libertarians and anarcho-capitalists of today |last=Brooks |first=Frank H. |year=1994 |title=The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881\u20131908) |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page=xi|isbn=1-56000-132-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Joseph Kahn|title= Anarchism, the Creed That Won't Stay Dead; The Spread of World Capitalism Resurrects a Long-Dormant Movement |year=2000|journal=[[The New York Times]]|issue=5 August |ref=harv}}{{cite journal |author=Colin Moynihan |title=Book Fair Unites Anarchists.

According to Rothbard, \"what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other\".<ref name=\"fpc\">Rothbard, Murray N (1973). \"[https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1559 A Future of Peace and Capitalism]\".

''The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal''.</ref> According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society, such as cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses and so on. Moreover, anarcho-capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of left-wing anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. In order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitarian-anarchist system.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\"/>\n\nHowever, Rothbard also wrote a piece, published posthumously, entitled \"Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?\" in which he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that \"we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines\". Furthermore, he said: \"We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/2801|title=Mises Daily|work=Mises Institute}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Classical liberalism ===\n{{main|Classical liberalism}}\nClassical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]] while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].\n\nIn the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''), who wrote: \"The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else\". [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote: \"I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have\".<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Thoreau/CivilDisobedience.html Civil Disobedience]</ref>\n\nThe early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The \"normative core\" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of ''laissez-faire'', a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.<ref>Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|978-0-415-16493-1}}, 1998, p. 17</ref> Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. In the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same.\n\nIn his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity\". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers \"had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism\".<ref>Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e au CNRS</ref> Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society vs. state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.<ref name=\"Molinari-1849\"/> The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul \u00c9mile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right. These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]] and [[H. L. Mencken]]. In the 1950s, the new \"fusion conservatism\", also called \"[[Cold War]] conservatism\", took hold of the right-wing in the United States, stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the Libertarian Party.\n\n=== 19th century individualist anarchism in the United States ===\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]] like [[Lysander Spooner]] (1808\u20131887) influenced anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]]<ref>\"[...] only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men.

He sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: \"There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\".<ref name=autogenerated3>\"[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)</ref> He held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.\n\nRothbard disagreed with this as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Tucker held a labor theory of value and as a result he thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or \"usury\" was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. As an Austrian economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in the free market. He did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.\n\nOf particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of \"sovereignty of the individual\", a market economy and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the state. Tucker said: \"[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices\".<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. \"Instead of a Book\" (1893)</ref>\n\n== Historical precedents similar to anarcho-capitalism ==\n<!-- Other examples, such as the early colonies in the U.S., provided by [http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/faq.html this source] may be included as well. -->\n\n=== Yurok Indians and their Northern California neighbors ===\nAfter studying the [[Yurok people|Yurok]], [[Hupa]], and [[Karuk|Karok]] Indians and some of their Northern California neighbors, Walter Goldsmidt reported \"a culture which reflects in surprising degree certain structural and ethical characteristics of emergent capitalistic Europe\".<ref>Walter Goldsmidt, \"Ethics and Structure of Society: An Ethnological Contribution to the Sociology of Knowledge\", American Anthropologist 53 (Oct\u2013Dec 1951): 506\u201324</ref> Commenting on this, Bruce Benson writes:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[https://mises.org/system/tdf/9_1_1_0.pdf?file=1&type=document]</ref> <blockquote>In this Indian society, property was universally held in individual private ownership. Socially, these Indians were organized in households and villages. There were no class or other inalienable group affiliations, and no vested authoritarian position-that is no state-like government with coercive power. Private property rights were sharply defined. Title considerations, for example, included (1) separation of title to different types of products; (2) ownership rights within the territory of an alien group (e.g. Hupas owned property inside Yurok territory); and (3) the division of title between persons (e.g., a fishing place could be owned by several people and its use divided so that one person used it one day, another the next, and so on). Ownership was complete and transferable. Exchange was facilitated by a monetary system.</blockquote>\n\nBenson also notes that there was a well-developed system of private arbitration: <blockquote>These Indian tribes nevertheless had a well-developed system of private judging. For instance, if a Yurok wanted to process a legal claim he would hire two, three, or four \"crossers\" \u2013 nonrelatives from a community other than his own. The defendant in the claim would also hire crossers, and the entire group hired by both parties would act as go-betweens, ascertaining claims and defenses and gathering evidence. The crossers would render a judgment for damages after hearing all the evidence.</blockquote>\n\n=== The legal system of the Ifugao of Northern Luzon ===\nLegal scholar Bruce Benson notes:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> <blockquote>The economy of the Ifugao in Northern Luzon during the early 1900s was dominated by an intensive irrigation hoe culture. Such an economy inevitably requires laws, if for no other reason than to resolve issues over water rights and maintain a complex real-estate system. And the Ifugao developed a very elaborate system of substantive law. Yet the Ifugao had no tribal, district, or village governmental organizations, and no centralized authority with the power to force compliance with the laws or to levy compulsive sanctions on behalf of the society at large.</blockquote>\n\nThe basic political unit was the family, which had a leader, but not in the sense of a political ruler as Hoebel notes:<ref>E. Adamson Hoebel, \"The Law of Primitive Man: A Study in Comparative Legal Dynamics\" p. 101</ref> \"Although he leads the family in legal and economic enterprise, its members think of him more as an integrating core than as a head who in any way dominates\". The kinfolk had a mutual duty to support each other in disputes with members of other families. They did not settle these disputes through warfare, but through arbitration by a voluntarily contracted \"monkalun\". Benson notes:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> <blockquote>But what happened if the defendant refused to admit his guilt and would not come to terms through the monkalun? Did interfamily warfare break out? The answer to the second question is no because the answer to the first is that such a refusal would be viewed as an insult to the monkalun and align his family against whichever party initiated the violence. This prospect deterred any immediate action by either party even when an impasse was reached.</blockquote>\n\n=== The Kapauku Papuans of West New Guinea ===\nThe Kapauku Papuans were a primitive linguistic group of about 45,000 living by means of horticulture in the western part of the central highlands of West New Guinea until well past the middle of the 20th century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Their culture emphasized individual freedom and there was no common property; and almost all property was individually owned as Pospisil remarks:<ref>Pospisil, \"Anthropology of Law\", p. 66</ref> <blockquote>A house, boat, bow and arrows, field, crops, patches of second-growth forest, or even a meal shared by a family or household is always owned by one person. Individual ownership is so extensive in the Kamu Valley that we find the virgin forests divided into tracts which belong to single individuals. Relatives, husbands and wives do not own anything in common. Even an eleven-year-old boy can own his field and his money and play the role of debtor and creditor as well.</blockquote>\n\nBenson observes:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> <blockquote>Their reciprocal arrangements for support and protection were based on kinship, as with the Ifugao. However, members of two or more patrilineages typically joined together for defensive and legal purposes, even though they often belonged to different sibs. These \"confederations\" often encompassed from three to nine villages, with each village consisting of about fifteen households. The Kapauku had no formal government with coercive power.</blockquote>\n\nThose who were rich and considered to be honest and generous became leaders called ''tonowi''. However, they held no coercive authority over others. Legal disputes were handled through contractual arbitration, which was enforced ultimately by the threat of being outlawed and ostracized by all members of one's confederation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Free cities of medieval Europe ===\nEconomist and libertarian scholar [[Bryan Caplan]] cites the free cities of medieval Europe as important examples of anarchist or nearly anarchistic societies:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm|title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2|website=econfaculty.gmu.edu}}</ref> <blockquote>One case that has inspired both sorts of anarchists is that of the free cities of medieval Europe. The first weak link in the chain of feudalism, these free cities became Europe's centers of economic development, trade, art, and culture. They provided a haven for runaway serfs, who could often legally gain their freedom if they avoided re-capture for a year and a day. And they offer many examples of how people can form mutual-aid associations for protection, insurance, and community. Of course, left-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists take a somewhat different perspective on the free cities: the former emphasize the communitarian and egalitarian concerns of the free cities, while the latter point to the relatively unregulated nature of their markets and the wide range of services (often including defense, security, and legal services) which were provided privately or semi-privately.</blockquote>\n\n=== Medieval Iceland ===\n[[File:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as David D. Friedman and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society]]\nAccording to the libertarian theorist [[David D. Friedman]]: \"Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions\".<ref name=\"Friedman-79\">Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.</ref> While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the legal system of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] comes close to being a real-world anarcho-capitalist legal system<ref>{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|edition=3rd|pages=203\u2013204|chapter=Private Law Enforcement, Medieval Iceland, and Libertarianism|author=Friedman, David D|isbn= 978-1507785607}}</ref> because while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so it provides some evidence of how such a society would function. \"Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially 'public' offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system\".<ref name=\"Friedman-79\"/> Commenting on its political structure, libertarian scholar [[Roderick Long]] remarks:<ref name=\"lewrockwell.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/06/roderick-t-long/the-vikings-were-libertarians|title=The Vikings Were Libertarians|publisher=LewRockwell.com}}</ref> <blockquote>The legal system's administration, insofar as it had one, lay in the hands of a parliament of about 40 officers whom historians call, however inadequately, \"chieftains\". This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland's reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity. The basis of a chieftain's power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his masterful study of the period, \"just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power\"; the mere office by itself was \"almost worthless\" unless the chieftain could \"convince some free-farmers to follow him\". Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area.</blockquote>\n\nLong observes how the system of free contract between farmers and chieftains was threatened when harassment from Norwegian kings that began around AD 1000 forced the people of Iceland to accept Christianity as the national religion, which paved the way for the introduction of a compulsory tax in AD 1096 which was to be paid to the local chieftain who owned a churchstead. This gave an unfair advantage to some chieftains who at least in part did not need to rely upon the voluntary support of their clients in order to receive some income. This gradually lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few big chieftains, enabling them to restrict competition and eventually establish effective monopolies. Although the Commonwealth was politically stable for over three centuries, longer than any democracy has lasted, its eventual down fall was brought about according to Long \"not through having too much privatization, but through having too little\".<ref name=\"lewrockwell.com\"/> He notes: <blockquote>[T]he Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament \u2013 i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall \u2013 while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.</blockquote>\n\n=== American Old West ===\nAccording to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that \"private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved\" and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.<ref>Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P.

Civil disputes were settled by private arbiters called \"brehons\" and the compensation to be paid to the wronged party was insured through voluntary surety relationships. Commenting on the \"kings\" of tuaths, Rothbard states: <blockquote>The king was elected by the tuath from within a royal kin-group (the derbfine), which carried the hereditary priestly function. Politically, however, the king had strictly limited functions: he was the military leader of the tuath, and he presided over the tuath assemblies. But he could only conduct war or peace negotiations as agent of the assemblies; and he was in no sense sovereign and had no rights of administering justice over tuath members. He could not legislate, and when he himself was party to a lawsuit, he had to submit his case to an independent judicial arbiter.<ref name=\"mises.org\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Law merchant, admiralty law and early common law ===\nMany libertarian historians<ref>Rothbard. \"[http://www.ozarkia.net/bill/anarchism/library/DefenseServicesFreeMarket.html Defense Services on the Free Market]\"</ref><ref>Benson. \"[https://mises.org/library/enterprise-customary-law The Enterprise of Customary Law]\"</ref><ref>Hasnas. \"[http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/Obvious.pdf The Obviousness of Anarchy]\"</ref> have cited [[law merchant]], [[admiralty law]] and early [[common law]] as examples of anarcho-capitalism. In his work ''Power and Market'', Rothbard states: <blockquote>The law merchant, admiralty law, and much of the common law began to be developed by privately competitive judges, who were sought out by litigants for their expertise in understanding the legal areas involved. The fairs of Champagne and the great marts of international trade in the Middle Ages enjoyed freely competitive courts, and people could patronize those that they deemed most accurate and efficient.</blockquote>\n\nCommenting on [[law merchant]], the ''Britannica Encyclopedia'' states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/law-merchant|title=law merchant \u2013 medieval European law|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> <blockquote>The law merchant was developed in the early 11th century in order to protect foreign merchants not under the jurisdiction and protection of the local law. Foreign traders often were subject to confiscations and other types of harassment if one of their countrymen had defaulted in a business transaction. A kind of law was also needed by which the traders themselves could negotiate contracts, partnerships, trademarks, and various aspects of buying and selling. The law merchant gradually spread as the traders went from place to place. Their courts, set up by the merchants themselves at trade fairs or in cities, administered a law that was uniform throughout Europe, regardless of differences in national laws and languages. It was based primarily on Roman law, although there were some Germanic influences; it formed the basis for modern commercial law. </blockquote>\n\nRegarding common law, David D. Friedman notes:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Anarchy_and_Eff_Law/Anarchy_and_Eff_Law.html|title=Anarchy and Efficient Law|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> <blockquote>The common law had its origin in the legal system of Anglo-Saxon England, whose early form involved a large element of private enforcement and private arbitration. It evolved in an environment of multiple court systems \u2013 church, royal, and local \u2013 where litigants had at least some control over where their disputes were resolved. Some common law rules originated as private norms, and I have argued that norms are produced on something like a competitive market. Some rules may have been borrowed from the medieval Fair Courts, which had some of the characteristics of the system I have described.</blockquote>\n\nCommenting on the evolution of British common law, the classical liberal economist [[Adam Smith]] noted in his treatise ''The Wealth of Nations'': <blockquote>The fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of the different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw to itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account, willing to take cognisance of many suits which were not originally intended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king's bench, instituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognisance of civil suits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him justice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanour. The court of exchequer, instituted for the levying of the king's revenue, and for enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took cognisance of all other contract debts; the plaintiff alleging that he could not pay the king because the defendant would not pay him. In consequence of such fictions it came, in many cases, to depend altogether upon the parties before what court they would choose to have their cause tried; and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and impartiality, to draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present admirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps, originally in a great measure formed by this emulation which anciently took place between their respective judges; each judge endeavouring to give, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would admit for every sort of injustice.</blockquote>\n\n=== Somalia from 1991 to 2006 ===\n{{main|History of Somalia (1991\u20132006)}}\nFrom 1991 to 2006, [[Somalia]] is cited as a real-world example of a [[stateless society]] and legal system.<ref name=\"maccallum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/story/2701|title=The Rule of Law Without the State|accessdate=2007-10-03|last=MacCallum|first=Spencer Heath|authorlink=Spencer MacCallum|date=2007-09-12|work=Mises Daily Article|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman|authorlink=Jeffrey Gettleman|title=In Somalia, Those Who Feed Off Anarchy Fuel It|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/world/africa/25somalia.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-04-27|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Since the fall of [[Siad Barre]]'s government in January 1991, there had been no central government in Somalia<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html |title=Somalia |accessdate=2007-10-01 |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] }}</ref> until the establishment of the [[Transitional National Government]] and its successor the [[Transitional Federal Government]].

An early example is [[Robert A.

In fact, his plays are the main source of information about him and his life. It was conventional in [[Old Comedy]] for the [[Greek chorus|Chorus]] to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the '[[Aristophanes#Parabasis|parabasis]]' and thus some biographical facts can be found there. However, these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life.<ref>''Greek Comedy and Ideology'' David Konstan, Oxford University Press US 1995, p. 6</ref> He was a comic ''poet'' in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of 'teacher' ([[Theatre director#The director in theatre history|didaskalos]]), and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal, it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues.<ref>Dover, K. J. (ed.) ''Aristophanes: The Clouds''. [[Oxford University Press]], 1970, Intro. p. XIV</ref>\n\nAristophanes claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience,<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), [[Oxford Classical Texts]], ''Clouds'', pp. 520\u2013525</ref> yet he also declared that 'other times' would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays.<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Clouds'', pp. 560\u2013562</ref> He sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist<ref>''Wasps'' 1536\u201337 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek), ''Clouds'', pp. 545\u2013548, ''Peace'', pp. 739\u2013758</ref> yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Athenian society. He caricatured leading figures in the arts (notably [[Euripides]], whose influence on his own work however he once grudgingly acknowledged),<ref name=\"Barrett 2003 p.9\">Barrett (2003), p. 9</ref> in politics (especially the populist [[Cleon]]), and in philosophy/religion (where Socrates was the most obvious target). Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an old-fashioned conservative, yet that view of him leads to contradictions.<ref>Andrewes, Antony. ''Greek Society''. [[Pelican Books]], 1981, pp. 247\u2013248</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. H. Sommerstein (ed), [[Penguin Books]] 1975, p. 9 footnote</ref> His plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens, the [[Lenaia]] and [[City Dionysia]], where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dramatists. An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five. These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences<ref>Barrett (1964), p. 26</ref> yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences.<ref>Barrett (1964), p. 25</ref> The theatres were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10,000 at the Theatre of Dionysus. The day's program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a '[[satyr]]' play ahead of a comedy, but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of [[demagogues]] like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits. The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience.\n\nThe production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays. Throughout most of Aristophanes' career, the Chorus was essential to a play's success and it was recruited and funded by a ''[[choregus]]'', a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the [[archon]]s. A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in ''[[The Knights]]'' that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon.<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''The Knights'' lines 911\u2013925</ref> Thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of Athenian society, on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their plays.<ref>Rennie, W. ''The Acharnians of Aristophanes'', [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] (London, 1909), p. 7 (reproduced by Bibliolife)</ref>\n\nWhen Aristophanes' first play ''The Banqueters'' was produced, Athens was an ambitious, imperial power and the [[Peloponnesian War]] was only in its fourth year. His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation (the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Battle of Marathon|victors at Marathon]])<ref>''Wasps'' 1075\u20131101 [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek), ''Knights'' 565\u2013576</ref><ref>''Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 Wikisource (Greek Text)] 692\u2013700</ref> yet they are not jingoistic, and they are staunchly opposed to the war with Sparta. The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently. By the time his last play was produced (around 386 BC) Athens had been defeated in war, its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from being the political to the intellectual centre of Greece.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. H. Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, pp. 13\u201314</ref> Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period\u2014the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until, in his last surviving play, ''[[Plutus (play)|Wealth II]]'', it more closely resembles [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy (nea)|New Comedy]]. However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations.<ref>Barrett (1964), p. 12</ref>\n\nAristophanes won second prize at the [[City Dionysia]] in 427 BC with his first play ''The Banqueters'' (now lost). He won first prize there with his next play, ''The Babylonians'' (also now lost). It was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Dionysia, and ''The Babylonians'' caused some embarrassment for the Athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the [[Delian League]] as slaves grinding at a mill.<ref>\"Greek Drama\" P. Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J. Boardman, J. Griffin, O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, p. 177</ref> Some influential citizens, notably [[Cleon]], reviled the play as slander against the ''[[polis]]'' and possibly took legal action against the author. The details of the trial are unrecorded but, speaking through the hero of his third play ''[[The Acharnians]]'' (staged at the [[Lenaia]], where there were few or no foreign dignitaries), the poet carefully distinguishes between the ''polis'' and the real targets of his acerbic wit:\n{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|\n{{lang|grc|\u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, \u03ba\u03bf\u1f50\u03c7\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9,\n\u03bc\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c7\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9,\n\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1fbd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c7\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1...}}<ref>''The Acharnians'', Wikisource [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] lines 515\u201317</ref>\n|\nPeople among us, and I don't mean the polis,\nRemember this&nbsp;\u2014 I don't mean the polis -\nBut wicked little men of a counterfeit kind....}}\n\nAristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays. But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleon's political career\u2014a few weeks after the performance of ''The Knights''\u2014a play full of anti-Cleon jokes\u2014Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals.<ref>Barrett (2003) p. 34</ref> Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes: the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his death.\n\nIn the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes, scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays. [[Inscriptiones Graecae|Inscriptions]] and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues. We know however from a combination of these sources,<ref>D. Welsh, ''IG ii<sup>2</sup> 2343, Philonides and Aristophanes' Banqueters'', Classical Quarterly 33 (1983)</ref> and especially from comments in ''The Knights''<ref>Knights 512\u201314</ref> and ''The Clouds'',<ref>''Clouds'' 530\u2013533</ref> that Aristophanes' first three plays were not directed by him\u2014they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides,<ref>Ian Storey, General Introduction, in ''Clouds, Wasps, Birds By Aristophanes'', [[Peter Meineck]] (translator), [[Hackett Publishing]] 1998, p. xiii</ref> an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well (Philoneides for example later directed ''The Frogs'' and he was also credited, perhaps wrongly, with directing ''The Wasps''.)<ref>MacDowell (1971), p. 124</ref> Aristophanes's use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information because apparent self-references might have been made with reference to his directors instead. Thus for example a statement by the chorus in ''The Acharnians''<ref>''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 652\u201354</ref> seems to indicate that the 'poet' had a close, personal association with the island of [[Aegina]], yet the terms 'poet' (''poietes'') and 'director' (''didaskalos'') are often interchangeable as dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus. Similarly, the hero in ''The Acharnians'' complains about Cleon \"dragging me into court\" over \"last year's play\"<ref>''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 377\u201382</ref> but here again it is not clear if this was said in reference to Aristophanes or Callistratus, either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cleon.<ref>W.Rennie, ''The Acharnians of Aristophanes'', Edward Arnold (London, 1909), pp. 12\u201315 (reproduced by [[Bibliolife]])</ref>\n\nComments made by the Chorus referring to Aristophanes in ''[[The Clouds]]''<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F.

''Frogs'' in fact won the unique distinction of a repeat performance at a subsequent festival.

J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Introduction p. IX note 1.</ref> It purports to be a record of conversations at a dinner party at which both Aristophanes and Socrates are guests, held some seven years after the performance of ''The Clouds'', the play in which Socrates was cruelly caricatured. One of the guests, [[Alcibiades]], even quotes from the play when teasing Socrates over his appearance<ref>''Symposium'' 221B; ''Plato'' Vol.3, [[Loeb Classical Library]] (1975), p. 236</ref> and yet there is no indication of any ill-feeling between Socrates and Aristophanes. Plato's Aristophanes is in fact a genial character and this has been interpreted as evidence of Plato's own friendship with him<ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Books, 1973, p. 10</ref> (their friendship appears to be corroborated by an epitaph for Aristophanes, ''reputedly'' written by Plato, in which the playwright's soul is compared to an eternal shrine for the [[Graces]]).<ref>Barrett (2003), p. 10</ref> Plato was only a boy when the events in ''The Symposium'' are supposed to have occurred and it is possible that his Aristophanes is in fact based on a reading of the plays. For example, conversation among the guests turns to the subject of Love and Aristophanes explains his notion of it in terms of an amusing allegory, a device he often uses in his plays. He is represented as suffering an attack of [[hiccoughs]] and this might be a humorous reference to the crude physical jokes in his plays.

The orator [[Quintilian]] believed that the charm and grandeur of the Attic dialect made Old Comedy an example for orators to study and follow, and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of Homer.<ref name=\"orators\">''The Orator's Training'' Quintilian 10.1.65\u20136, cited in Barrett (2003) p. 15</ref><ref>Quintilian 10.1.65\u20136 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]</ref> A revival of interest in the Attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Aristophanes' plays during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, resulting in their survival today.<ref name=\"orators\" /> In Aristophanes' plays, the Attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities.\n\nFor Aristophanes' contemporaries the works of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] formed the cornerstones of Hellenic history and culture. Thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire.<ref>Barrett (1964) pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets. These include not only rival comic dramatists such as [[Eupolis]] and [[Hermippus]]<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Clouds'' lines 553\u201354</ref> and predecessors such as [[Magnes (comic poet)|Magnes]], [[Crates (comic poet)|Crates]] and [[Cratinus]],<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Knights'' lines 519\u2013540</ref> but also tragedians, notably [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], all three of whom are mentioned in e.g. ''The Frogs''. Aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyrics.<ref>Barrett (1964), p. 30</ref> He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular, so much so that the comic dramatist [[Cratinus]] labelled him a 'Euripidaristophanist' addicted to hair-splitting niceties.<ref name=\"Barrett 2003 p.9\"/>\n\nA full appreciation of Aristophanes' plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill, and of their different rhythms and associations.<ref>MacDowell (1978), p. 21</ref> There were three broad poetic forms: iambic dialogue, tetrameter verses and lyrics:<ref>Barrett (2003), pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n* '''Iambic dialogue''': Aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the [[iambic trimeter]] (corresponding to the effects achieved by English poets such as Shakespeare using iambic pentameters). His realistic use of the meter<ref name=\"Other Plays' 2003, page 27\"/><ref>MacDowell (1978), p. 16</ref> makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy, as for instance in the prologue, before the arrival of the Chorus, when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot. ''The Acharnians'' opens with these three lines by the hero, Dikaiopolis (rendered here in English as iambic pentameters):\n\n::How many are the things that vex my heart!\n::Pleasures are few, so very few&nbsp;\u2014 just four -\n::But stressful things are manysandthousandsandheaps!<ref>''The Acharnians''[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 1\u20133</ref>\n\n:Here Aristophanes employs a frequent device, arranging the syntax so that the final word in a line comes as a comic climax.<ref name=\"MacDowell 1978 p.17\">MacDowell (1978), p. 17</ref> The hero's pleasures are so few he can number them ({{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1}}, four) but his causes for complaint are so many they beggar numerical description and he must invent his own word for them ({{lang|grc|\u03c8\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1}}, literally 'sandhundredheaps', here paraphrased 'manysandthousandsandheaps'). The use of invented [[compound words]] is another comic device frequently found in the plays.<ref>MacDowell (1978), p. 13</ref><ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1973, p. 37</ref>\n\n* '''Tetrameter catalectic verses''': These are long lines of [[anapaest|anapests]], [[trochees]] or iambs (where each line is ideally measured in four ''dipodes'' or pairs of feet), used in various situations within each play such as:\n** formal debates or ''agons'' between characters (typically in anapestic rhythm);\n** excited dialogue or heated argument (typically trochaic rhythm, the same as in early tragedy);\n** long speeches declaimed by the Chorus in [[Aristophanes#Parabasis|parabases]] (in either anapestic or trochaic rhythms);\n** informal debates barely above the level of ordinary dialogue (typically iambic).\n:Anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty (as in many [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s) and trochaic meter is suited to rapid delivery (the word 'trochee' is in fact derived from ''trechein'', 'to run', as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed, often in aggressive mood)<ref>L. P. E. Parker, ''The Songs of Aristophanes'', Oxford, 1997, p. 36</ref> However, even though both these rhythms can seem to 'bowl along'<ref name=\"Other Plays' 2003, page 27\">Barrett (2003) p. 27</ref> Aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted meters, adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument. In an anapestic passage in ''The Frogs'', for instance, the character Aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god, Dionysus:\n\n::'''AES.''':It was [[Orpheus]] singing who taught us religion and how wrong people are when they kill,\n::And we learned from [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] medicinal cures and the science of divination.\n::If it's farming you want, [[Hesiod]] knows it all, when to plant, when to harvest. How godlike\n::Homer got to be famous, I'll tell if you ask: he taught us what all good men should know,\n::Discipline, fortitude, battle-readiness. '''DIO.''': But no-one taught Pantocles&nbsp;\u2014 yesterday\n::He was marching his men up and down on parade when the crest of his helmet fell off!<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 2, F. W.  Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Frogs'' lines 1032\u20131038</ref>\n\nThe rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop, slows down to consider the revered poets Hesiod and Homer, then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pantocles. Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays, allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audience's appetite for the next joke.\n\n* '''Lyrics''': Almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied Greek lyrics, and the meter is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects, yet Aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics.<ref name=\"Other Plays' 2003, page 27\"/> Some of the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free of the comic action<ref>''Greek Drama'', Peter Levi, in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' edited by J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray, Oxford University Press 1986, p. 175</ref> In the example below, taken from ''The Wasps'', the lyric is merely a comic interlude and the rhythm is steadily trochaic. The syntax in the original Greek is natural and unforced and it was probably accompanied by brisk and cheerful music, gliding to a concluding pun at the expense of Amynias, who is thought to have lost his fortune gambling.<ref name=\"MacDowell1978p27\">MacDowell (1978) p. 27</ref>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nThough to myself I often seem\n:A bright chap and not awkward,\nNone comes close to Amynias,\n:Son of Sellos of the Bigwig\nClan, a man I once saw\n:Dine with rich Leogorus.\nNow as poor as Antiphon,\n:He lives on apples and pomegranates\nYet he got himself appointed\n:Ambassador to [[Farsala|Pharsalus]],\nWay up there in [[Thessaly]],\n:Home of the poor Penestes:\nHappy to be where everyone\n:Is as penniless as he is!<ref>MacDowell (1978), Wikisource: [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82 ] lines 1265\u201374</ref></poem>\n\n:The pun here in English translation (''Penestes''-''penniless'') is a weak version of the Greek [[pun]] {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9-\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''Pen\u00e9staisi-pen\u00e9st\u0115s'', \"destitute\". Many of the puns in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical, and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identify.<ref>Barrett (2003) p. 21</ref> Others are based on double meanings. Sometimes entire scenes are constructed on puns, as in ''The Acharnians'' with the [[Megarian]] farmer and his pigs:<ref>''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 729\u2013835</ref> the Megarian farmer defies the Athenian embargo against Megarian trade, and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs, except \"pig\" was ancient slang for \"vagina\". Since the [[Megarian decree|embargo against Megara]] was the pretext for the Peloponnesian War, Aristophanes naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of \"three cunts\".\n\nIt can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery, particularly the use of similes, metaphors and pictorial expressions.<ref name=\"MacDowell 1978 p.17\"/> In 'The Knights', for example, the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and close.<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' Tomus 1, F. W. Hall and W. M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, ''Knights'' lines 1347\u201348;</ref> In ''The Frogs'', [[Aeschylus]] is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpit.<ref>''The Frogs'' lines 902\u201304</ref> Some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character, such as the marriage of the hero Pisthetairos to [[Zeus]]'s paramour in ''The Birds'' and the 'recreation' of old Athens, crowned with roses, at the end of ''The Knights''.\n\n===Rhetoric===\nIt is widely believed that Aristophanes condemned rhetoric on both moral and political grounds. He states, \u201ca speaker trained in the new rhetoric may use his talents to deceive the jury and bewilder his opponents so thoroughly that the trial loses all semblance of fairness\u201d<ref name=\"Murphy, Charles T 1938\">Murphy, Charles T. \"Aristophanes and the Art of Rhetoric.\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 49 (1938): 69\u2013113. Web. Accessed on 28 September 2014.</ref> He is speaking to the \u201cart\u201d of flattery, and evidence points towards the fact that many of Aristophanes\u2019 plays were actually created with the intent to attack the view of rhetoric. The most noticeable attack can be seen in his play Banqueters, in which two brothers from different educational backgrounds argue over which education is better. One brother comes from a background of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d education while the other brother appears to be a product of the sophistic education <ref name=\"Murphy, Charles T 1938\"/>\n\nThe chorus was mainly used by Aristophanes as a defense against rhetoric and would often talk about topics such as the civic duty of those who were educated in classical teachings. In Aristophanes\u2019 opinion it was the job of those educated adults to protect the public from the deception and to stand as a beacon of light for those who were more gullible than others. One of the main reasons why Aristophanes was so against the sophists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization. Money was essential, which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sophists came from upper-class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis. Aristophanes believed that education and knowledge was a public service and that anything that excluded willing minds was nothing but an abomination.<ref>Major, Wilfred E. ''Aristophanes: Enemy of Rhetoric''. N.P.: N.P., 1996. Print.</ref> He concludes that all politicians that study rhetoric must have \"doubtful citizenships, unspeakable morals, and too much arrogance\u201d<ref name=\"Murphy, Charles T 1938\"/>\n\n==Old Comedy==\n[[File:Thalia sarcophagus Louvre Ma475.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]], [[muse]] of comedy, gazing upon a comic mask (detail from ''Muses' Sarcophagus'')]]\nThe Greek word for comedy (''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'') derives from the words for 'revel' and 'song' (''k\u014dmos'' and ''\u014dd\u0113'') and according to Aristotle<ref>''The Poetics'' 1449a11, Wikisource English translation [[s:The Poetics#IV]] section IV</ref> comic drama actually developed from song.

XIX</ref> only about 20 years before the performance there of ''The Acharnians'', the first of Aristophanes' surviving plays. According to Aristotle, comedy was slow to gain official acceptance because nobody took it seriously,<ref>''The Poetics'' 1448b38 \u2013 1449b, Wikisource English translation [[s:The Poetics#V]] section V</ref> yet only 60 years after comedy first appeared at the City Dionysia, Aristophanes observed that producing comedies was the most difficult work of all.<ref>''Aristophanis Comoediae'' vol. 1, F.

VIII</ref> For ancient commentators such as Plutarch,<ref>''Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander''</ref> New Comedy was a more sophisticated form of drama than Old Comedy. However, Old Comedy was in fact a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment.<ref>''Clouds'' translated by P. Meineck with introduction by I. Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, p. VII</ref> In Aristophanes' early plays, the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions, and these were only gradually simplified and abandoned.\n\nThe City Dionysia and the Lenaia were celebrated in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy.

''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1975, p. 18</ref> In ''The Frogs'', the god appears also as a dramatic character, and he enters the theatre ludicrously disguised as [[Hercules]]. He observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Phrynichus (one of Aristophanes' rivals) he ages by more than a year.<ref>''Frogs'' Wikisource English translation [[s:The Frogs]]; original Greek text [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%B9 ] lines 12\u201318</ref> This scene opens the play, and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Comedy\u2014not even its patron god and its practitioners. Gods, artists, politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets, comedy was a kind of licensed buffoonery,<ref>Andrewes, Antony. ''Greek Society''. Pelican Books 1981, p. 248</ref> and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slandered in a play.<ref>Barrett, David. ''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays''. Penguin Classics 1964, p. 27</ref> There were certain limits to the scope of the satire, but they are not easily defined. Impiety could be punished in 5th century Athens, but the absurdities implicit in the traditional religion were open to ridicule.<ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1975, p. 17</ref> The [[polis]] was not allowed to be slandered, but as stated in the biography section of this article, that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involved.\n\nFor convenience, Old Comedy, as represented by Aristophanes' early plays, is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics\u2014 topicality, festivity and complexity. Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes' plays. However, it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section.\n\n===Topicality===\nOld Comedy's emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries\u2014see for example articles on ''[[The Knights]]'', ''[[The Wasps]]'' and ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'' for lists of topical references. The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens.\n\n* '''Individual masks''': All actors in [[classical Athens]] wore masks, but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters, in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people. Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, p. 31</ref> In ''The Knights'' we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon (there represented as a Paphlagonian slave) but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway.<ref>''Knights'' lines 230\u2013233</ref>\n* '''The real scene of action''': Since Old Comedy makes numerous references to people in the audience, the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke. In ''The Acharnians'', for example, The [[Pnyx]] is just a few steps from the hero's front door, and in ''Peace'' Olympus is separated from Athens by a few moments' supposed flight on a dung beetle. The audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action. When the hero in ''Peace'' returns to Athens from his flight to Olympus, he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens, and seen up close they look even worse.<ref>''Peace'' 821\u2013823</ref> In ''The Acharnians'' the hero confronts the [[Archon|archon basileus]],<ref>''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 1224\u20131225</ref> sitting in the front row, and demands to be awarded first prize for a drinking competition, which is a none too subtle way for Aristophanes to request first prize for the drama competition.\n* '''Self-mocking theatre''': Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand. But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies, and thus references to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience.<ref>\"Greek Drama\" Peter Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, p. 176</ref> The comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself. It is possible, as indicated earlier, that Aristophanes mocked his own baldness. In ''The Clouds'', the Chorus compares him to an unwed, young mother<ref>''Clouds'' lines 528\u2013533</ref> and in ''The Acharnians'' the Chorus mockingly depicts him as Athens' greatest weapon in the war against Sparta.<ref>''The Acharnians'' lines 646-651</ref>\n* '''Political theatre''': The Lenaia and City Dionysia were state-sponsored, religious festivals, and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two, both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance. The ceremonies for the Lenaia were overseen by the [[archon basileus]] and by officials of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. The City Dionysia was overseen by the [[Archon|archon eponymous]] and the priest of Dionysus. Opening ceremonies for the City Dionysia featured, in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god, a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and, until the end of the Peloponnesian War, a presentation of annual tribute from subject states.<ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1973, pp. 18\u201319</ref> Religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously. Even jokes can be serious when the topic is politics\u2014especially in wartime. The butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens, including oracle-mongers,<ref>e.g. ''Knights'' lines 997\u20131095; ''Birds'' lines 959\u2013991</ref> the exponents of new religious practices,<ref>e.g. ''Clouds'' lines 263\u201366, ''Frogs'' lines 891\u201394</ref> war-profiteers and political fanatics. In ''The Acharnians'', for example, [[Lamachus]] is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the hero's preparations for a dinner party.<ref>''The Acharnians'' lines 1097\u20131142 lines</ref> [[Cleon]] emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in ''The Knights'' as a protean form of comic evil, clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can, yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking Poseidon and Athena,<ref>''Knights'' lines 551\u201364 and 581\u2013594</ref> and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed Demos (i.e. the morally reformed citizenry of Athens).<ref>''Knights'' lines 1321\u201338</ref> Imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with Sparta,<ref>e.g. ''Peace'' lines 551\u2013597</ref> and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revolt<ref>''Frogs'' lines 686\u2013705</ref> are other examples of a serious purpose behind the plays.\n* '''Teasing and taunting''': A festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets, not just political or religious ones\u2014anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason, such as diseases, physical deformities, ugliness, family misfortunes, bad manners, perversions, dishonesty, cowardice in battle, and clumsiness.<ref>Dover, K. J. (ed). ''Aristophanes: Clouds''. Oxford University Press 1970, pp. XIII\u2013XIV</ref> Foreigners, a conspicuous presence in imperial Athens, particularly at the City Dionysia, often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing Attic words\u2014these include Spartans (''Lysistrata''), Scythians (''Thesmophoriazusae''), Persians, Boeotians and Megarians (''The Acharnians'').\n\n===Festivity===\nThe Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals, but they resembled a gala rather than a church service.<ref>Dover, K. J. ''Aristophanes: Clouds''. Oxford University Press 1970, p. XV</ref>\n\n* '''Dirty jokes''': A relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and gods.<ref>\"Greek Drama\" Peter Levi in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press 1986, p. 175</ref> Old Comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed and difficult to understand without expert commentary, as when the Chorus in ''The Acharnians'' places a curse on Antimachus,<ref>''The Acharnians'' [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ]  Wikisource (Original Greek) lines 1164\u20131173</ref> a choregus accused of niggardly conduct, wishing upon him a night-time mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him, as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness, accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead. He is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker, missing and accidentally hitting Cratinus, a lyric poet not admired by Aristophanes.<ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1973, pp. 243\u2013244, notes 69, 80, 81</ref> This was particularly funny because the curse was sung (or chanted) in choreographed style by a Chorus of 24 grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizens.\n* '''The musical extravaganza''': The Chorus was vital to the success of a play in Old Comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedy.<ref>Barrett, David. ''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays''. Penguin Classics 1964, pp. 14\u201315</ref> Technically, the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between choruses.<ref>Sommerstein, Alan (ed). ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds''. Penguin Classics 1973, p. 23</ref> In fact eight of Aristophanes' eleven surviving plays are named after the Chorus. In Aristophanes' time, the Chorus in tragedy was relatively small (twelve members) and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator, but in Old Comedy the Chorus was large (numbering 24), it was actively involved in the plot, its entry into the action was frequently spectacular, its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actors.<ref>''The Acharnians''  [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82 ] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 280\u2013301; ''Knights'' lines 247\u201372; ''Wasps''  [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A3%CF%86%CE%AE%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%82] Wikisource (original Greek) lines 452\u2013460</ref>  The expenditure on costumes, training and maintenance of a Chorus was considerable,<ref>Barrett, David. ''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays''. Penguin Classics 1964, p. 9</ref> and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and music.<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, pp. 14\u201315</ref> The chorus gradually lost its significance as New Comedy began to develop.\n* '''Obvious costumes''': Consistent with the holiday spirit, much of the humour in Old Comedy is slapstick buffoonery and dirty jokes that do not require the audience's careful attention, often relying on visual cues. Actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding, with a prodigious, leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic. Female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long, saffron tunics.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, p. 29</ref> Sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect, as in ''The Frogs'', where Dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic, the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized [[Heracles]]\u2014an absurd outfit that provokes the character Heracles (as no doubt it provoked the audience) to guffaws of helpless mirth.<ref>''Frogs'' lines 45\u201347</ref>\n* '''The farcical anti-climax''': The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences. The major confrontation (''agon'') between the 'good' and 'bad' characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play. The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes. The farcical anti-climax has been explained in a variety of ways, depending on the particular play. In ''The Wasps'', for instance, it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main character's perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed.<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, p. 7</ref> In ''The Acharnians'', it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes, demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pp. 33\u201334</ref> But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy<ref>''Aristophanes' Old-and-new Comedy'' Kenneth J. Reckford, UNC Press 1987, p. 15</ref> and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle, the music, jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play. The celebration of the hero's victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding, thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure.<ref>''Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays'' David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\n===Complexity===\nThe development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots, a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone.<ref>''Aristophanes'' D. Slavitt and P. Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, p. XIII</ref> Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour, even to the point of undermining the humour itself.<ref>''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'' M. S. Silk, Oxford University Press 2002, p. 418</ref>\n\n* '''Inclusive comedy''': Old Comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience. It accommodated a serious purpose, light entertainment, hauntingly beautiful lyrics, the buffoonery of puns and invented words, obscenities, disciplined verse, wildly absurd plots and a formal, dramatic structure.\n* '''Fantasy and absurdity''': Fantasy in Old Comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignored.<ref>''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K. J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, p. XIII</ref> Situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions, an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] (the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]).<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, p. 12</ref> The crazy costume worn by Dionysus in ''The Frogs'' is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical grounds\u2014he wears a woman's saffron-coloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity, buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy, and a lion skin cape because, like Heracles, his mission leads him into [[Hades]]. Absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot. In ''The Knights'' for instance, Cleon's corrupt service to the people of Athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master. The introduction of a rival, who is not a member of the household, leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor, so that Cleon and his rival become [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastai]] competing for the affections of an [[eromenos]], hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public, athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular vote.\n* '''The resourceful hero''': In Aristophanic comedy, the hero is an independent-minded and self-reliant individual. He has something of the ingenuity of Homer's [[Odysseus]] and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours. Typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situation.<ref>''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, p. VIII</ref> Thus Dikaiopolis in ''The Acharnians'' contrives a ''private'' peace treaty with the Spartans; Bdelucleon in ''The Wasps'' turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his jury-addicted father safely at home; Trygaeus in ''Peace'' flies to Olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the Peloponnesian War; Pisthetairus in ''Birds'' sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the gods.\n* '''The resourceful cast''': The numerous surprising developments in an Aristophanic plot, the changes in scene, and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play, were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors (a fourth actor, often the leader of the chorus, was permitted to deliver short speeches).<ref>''Aristophanes: The Frogs and other Plays'' David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, p. 17</ref> Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off-stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene.\n* '''Complex structure''': The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal, dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another. The different, structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translations.\n\n===Dramatic structure===\nThe structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows:\n* '''prologue''' - an introductory scene with a dialogue and/or soliloquy addressed to the audience, expressed in [[iambic trimeter]] and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play;\n* '''parodos''' - the arrival of the chorus, dancing and singing, sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors, often expressed in long lines of tetrameters;\n* '''symmetrical scenes''' - passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters, arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length; the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes:\n** '''parabasis''' - verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly, firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end (see the section below, [[Aristophanes#Parabasis|Parabasis]]);\n** '''agon''' - a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play, typically in anapestic tetrameter, though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior arguments;<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed.), Oxford University Press 1971, p. 207 note 546\u2013630</ref>\n* '''episodes''' - sections of dialogue in iambic trimeter, often in a succession of scenes featuring minor characters towards the end of a play;\n* '''songs''' ('strophes'/'antistrophes' or 'odes'/'antodes')\u2013often in symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number of lines as the other, used as transitions between other structural elements, or between scenes while actors change costume, and often commenting on the action;\n* '''exodus''' - the departure of the Chorus and the actors, in song and dance celebrating the hero's victory and sometimes celebrating a symbolic marriage.\nThe rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs.<ref>''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, p. 27</ref> In ''The Acharnians'' and ''Peace'', for example, there is no formal agon whereas in ''The Clouds'' there are two agons.\n\n====Parabasis====\nThe parabasis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage. In this role, the chorus is sometimes out of character, as the author's voice, and sometimes in character, although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish. Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end. The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes' own understanding was less formal.<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, p. 261</ref> The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis. The early plays (''The Acharnians'' to ''The Birds'') are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them.\n* '''kommation''': This is a brief prelude, comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors, such as {{lang|grc|\u1f34\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}} (Go rejoicing!).\n* '''parabasis proper''': This is usually a defense of the author's work and it includes criticism of the audience's attitude. It is declaimed in long lines of 'anapestic tetrameters'. Aristophanes himself refers to the parabasis proper only as 'anapests'.\n* '''pnigos''': Sometimes known as 'a choker', it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter (it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in \"The Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song\", in act 2 of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Iolanthe'').<ref name=\"Aristophanes: Wasps Douglas MacDowell 1978, page 27\">''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, p. 27</ref>\n* '''epirrhematic syzygies''': These are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other in meter and number of lines. They form part of the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second parabasis. They are characterized by the following elements:\n** ''strophe'' or ''ode'': These are lyrics in a variety of meters, sung by the Chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasis.\n** ''epirrhema'': These are usually long lines of trochaic tetrameters. Broadly political in their significance, they were probably spoken by the leader of the Chorus in character.<ref>''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K. J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, p. 126</ref>\n** ''antistrophe'' or ''antode'': These are songs that mirror the strophe/ode in meter, length and function.\n** ''antepirrhema''. This is another declaimed passage and it mirrors the epirrhema in meter, length and function.\n\n''[[The Wasps]]'' is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach<ref>''Aristophanes: Wasps'' Douglas M. MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, note 1283 p. 298</ref> and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows.\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; background-color: #ffffff\"\n!

For example, the parabasis proper in ''The Clouds'' (lines 518\u201362) is composed in eupolidean meter rather than in anapests<ref>''Aristophanes:Clouds'' K. J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, p. 119 note 518\u201362</ref> and the second parabasis includes a kommation but it lacks strophe, antistrophe and antepirrhema (''The Clouds'' lines 1113\u201330). The second parabasis in ''The Acharnians'' lines 971\u201399<ref>[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82#970 Wikisource]</ref> can be considered a hybrid parabasis/song (i.e. the declaimed sections are merely continuations of the strophe and antistrophe)<ref>''Comedy'' E. Handley in 'The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I', P. Easterling, R. MacGregor Walker Knox, E. Kenney (eds), p. 360</ref> and, unlike the typical parabasis, it seems to comment on actions that occur on stage during the address. An understanding of Old Comedy conventions such as the parabasis is necessary for a proper understanding of Aristophanes' plays; on the other hand, a sensitive appreciation of the plays is necessary for a proper understanding of the conventions.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Aristophanes Menander.jpg|thumb|200px|Aristophanes, the master of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Old Comedy]], and [[Menander]], the master of [[New Comedy]].]]\nThe tragic dramatists, [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop, yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because, in Aristophanes, it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age.<ref>\"Greek Drama\" Peter Levi, in ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, p. 176</ref> Indeed, according to one ancient source (Platonius, c.9th Century AD), one of Aristophanes's last plays, ''Aioliskon'', had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics (making it a type of Middle Comedy), while ''Kolakos'' anticipated all the elements of New Comedy, including a rape and a recognition scene.<ref>E. W. Handley, 'Comedy' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 400</ref> Aristophanes seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy, as indicated by his comment in ''Clouds'' that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays.<ref>''Clouds'' lines 560\u201362</ref> ''Clouds'' was awarded third (i.e. last) place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that Aristophanes intended to be read rather than acted.<ref>''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K. J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, pp. XXIX\u2013XXX</ref> The circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience, over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence: they did not affect the career of [[Cleon]], they failed to persuade the Athenians to pursue an honourable peace with Sparta and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of Socrates, whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosopher's disgraced associates (such as [[Alcibiades]]),<ref>''Aristophanes: Clouds'' K. J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, pp. XIV\u2013XV</ref> exacerbated of course by his own intransigence during the trial.<ref>Plato's ''Apology'', Benjamin Jowett (trans), Wikisource copy: [[s:Apology (Plato)#33]] (section 33)</ref> The plays, in manuscript form, have been put to some surprising uses\u2014as indicated [[Aristophanes#Aristophanes the Poet|earlier]], they were used in the study of rhetoric on the recommendation of [[Quintilian]] and by students of the Attic dialect in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries AD. It is possible that Plato sent copies of the plays to Dionysius of Syracuse so that he might learn about Athenian life and government.<ref>''Clouds'' Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, p. X</ref>\n\nLatin translations of the plays by [[Andreas Divus]] (Venice 1528) were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Renaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages. [[Jean Racine|Racine]], for example, drew ''Les Plaideurs'' (1668) from ''The Wasps''. [[Goethe]] (who turned to Aristophanes for a warmer and more vivid form of comedy than he could derive from readings of Terence and Plautus) adapted a short play ''Die V\u00f6gel'' from ''The Birds'' for performance in Weimar. Aristophanes has appealed to both conservatives and radicals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\u2014Anatoly Lunacharsky, first Commissar of Enlightenment for the USSR in 1917, declared that the ancient dramatist would have a permanent place in proletarian theatre and yet conservative, Prussian intellectuals interpreted Aristophanes as a satirical opponent of social reform.<ref>''Aristophanes in Performance 421 BC \u2013 AD 2007: Peace, Birds and Frogs'' Edith Hall and Amanda Wrigley, Legenda (Oxford) 2007, pp. 9\u201312</ref> The avant-gardist stage-director [[Karolos Koun]] directed a version of ''The Birds'' under the Acropolis in 1959 that established a trend in modern Greek history of breaking taboos through the voice of Aristophanes.<ref>''Politics and Aristophanes: watchword Caution!'' by Gonda Van Steen in 'The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theatre' Marianne McDonald and J. Michael Walton (eds), Cambridge University Press 2007, p. 109</ref>\n\nThe plays have a significance that goes beyond their artistic function, as historical documents that open the window on life and politics in [[classical Athens]], in which respect they are perhaps as important as the writings of [[Thucydides]]. The artistic influence of the plays is immeasurable. They have contributed to the history of European theatre and that history in turn shapes our understanding of the plays. Thus for example the operettas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] can give us insights into Aristophanes' plays<ref>e.g. ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, p. 37</ref> and similarly the plays can give us insights into the operettas.<ref>\"W. S. Gilbert: A Mid-Victorian Aristophanes\" in ''W. S.

The plot was written by Tasos Apostolidis and the sketches were of George Akokalidis. The stories feature either Aristophanes narrating them, directing the play, or even [[metafiction|as a character inside one of his stories]].\n\n===Electronic media===\n* ''[[Acropolis Now (radio)|Acropolis Now]]'' is a comedy radio show for the BBC set in Ancient Greece. It features Aristophanes, Socrates and many other famous Greeks. (Not to be confused with the Australian sitcom of the same name.) Aristophanes is characterised as a celebrity playwright, and most of his plays have the title formula: ''One of Our'' [e.g] ''Slaves has an Enormous Knob'' (a reference to the exaggerated appendages worn by Greek comic actors)\n* ''Aristophanes Against the World'' was a radio play by Martyn Wade and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]].

His philosophy was expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the [[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]] in [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]], in the part of [[French Equatorial Africa]] which is now Gabon. As a music scholar and organist, he studied the music of German composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and influenced the [[Organ reform movement|Organ Reform Movement]] (''Orgelbewegung'').\n\n==Nationality==\nSchweitzer was born in the province of [[Alsace]], which had been a French province since 1639 and became Prussian after France lost it to Prussia in 1871. It became French again in 1919, after Germany's defeat during the First World War. Schweitzer considered himself French,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent |first2=Woodland |last2=Kahler |date=1974 |title=Olga: The memoirs of Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent |location=New York, NY |publisher=Walker}} qtd. in [https://ivu.org/history/europe20a/schweitzer.html ''ivu.org'']</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=See talk page, section Nationality 2017}} and wrote mostly in German.

This compromise arose after the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Schweitzer, the pastor's son, grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance, and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=3\u20139}}\n\nSchweitzer's first language was the Alsatian dialect. At the [[Mulhouse]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] he received his \"[[Abitur]]\" (the certificate at the end of secondary education) in 1893. He studied [[Organ (music)|organ]] in Mulhouse from 1885 to 1893 with Eug\u00e8ne Munch, organist at the Protestant cathedral, who inspired Schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of German composer [[Richard Wagner]].<ref>A. Schweitzer, ''Eugene Munch'' (J. Brinkmann, Mulhouse 1898).</ref> In 1893 he played for the French [[organist]] [[Charles-Marie Widor]] (at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris]]), for whom [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship thus began.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=23\u201324}}\n\nFrom 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the [[University of Strasbourg|Kaiser Wilhelm University]] in [[Strasbourg]]. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch, the brother of his former teacher, organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J.S. Bach's music.{{sfn|Joy|1953|p=24}} Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg (under [[Otto Lohse]]) and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to see Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', which deeply impressed him. In 1898 he went back to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on ''The Religious Philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and to study in earnest with Widor.

With theological insight, he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] religious music. In 1899 he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bach's [[Chorale Preludes]] as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based. They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas, conceived visually. Widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old [[Lutheran]] hymns.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=20}}\n\nThe exposition of these ideas, encouraged by Widor and Munch, became Schweitzer's last task, and appeared in the masterly study ''J. S. Bach: Le Musicien-Po\u00e8te'', written in French and published in 1905. There was great demand for a German edition, but, instead of translating it, he decided to rewrite it.<ref>Schweitzer, ''My Life and Thought'', pp 80\u201381; cf. {{harvnb|Seaver|1951|pp=231\u2013232}}</ref> The result was two volumes (''J.

In 1909 he addressed the ''Third Congress of the International Society of Music'' at [[Vienna]] on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries, he produced a very considered report.<ref>{{harvnb|Joy|1953|pp=165\u2013166}}: Text of 1909 Questionnaire and Report, pp. 235\u2013269.</ref> This provided the basis for the ''International Regulations for Organ Building''. He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic [[reed pipe]]s, and with the classical Alsace [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] organ resources and baroque [[flue pipe]]s, all in registers regulated (by [[Organ stop|stops]]) to access distinct voices in [[fugue]] or [[counterpoint]] capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing the same music together.\n\nSchweitzer also studied piano under [[Isidor Philipp]], head of the piano department at the [[Paris Conservatory]].\n\nIn 1905 Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the [[Paris Bach Society]], a choir dedicated to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orf\u00e9o Catal\u00e0 at [[Barcelona]], Spain, and often travelled there for that purpose.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=20}} He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Works for organ|Bach's organ works]], with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912\u201314. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were to be worked on in Africa, but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=44}}\n\nOn departure for Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 in 1913 he was presented with a [[pedal piano]], a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard.<ref>Given by the Paris Bach Society, {{harvnb|Seaver|1951|p=63}}; but {{harvnb|Joy|1953|p=177}}, says it was given by the Paris Missionary Society.</ref> Built especially for the tropics, it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, packed in a zinc-lined case.

In 1900, with the completion of his licentiate in theology, he was ordained as curate, and that year he witnessed the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of [[Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)|Saint Thomas]], from which he had just graduated, and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent.{{Efn | He officiated at the wedding of [[Theodor Heuss]] (later the first President of West Germany) in 1908.{{sfn|Oermann|2016|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Brabazon|2000|p=422}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1956|p=63}}{{sfn|Pierhal|1957|p=63f}}<ref>{{cite | work=The Bulletin | location=Bonn, West Germany |publisher=Press and Information Office | issn=0032-7794 |volume=9-10 | year=1962 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o03jAAAAMAAJ&&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=schweitzer+wedding | access-date=2 July 2017 | page=36}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1906 he published ''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'' (\"History of Life-of-Jesus research\"). This book, which established his reputation, was first published in English in 1910 as ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913, containing theologically significant revisions and expansions: but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001. In 1931 he published ''Mystik des Apostels Paulus'' (\"The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle\"); a second edition was published in 1953.\n\n===''The Quest of the Historical Jesus (1906)''===\n{{Main|The Quest of the Historical Jesus}}\n\nIn ''The Quest'', Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the \"historical Jesus\" back to the late 18th century. He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors, and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century's findings. He maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus' own convictions, which reflected late Jewish [[eschatology]]. Schweitzer writes:\n\n{{Quote|The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah, who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God, who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed. He is a figure designed by rationalism, endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb.

Not only did he preach he would rise from the grave, but that he would also ascend to heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world, saying that no one, including himself, knew the exact time of his return, but it would be before the end of his generation. Schweitzer verified the many New Testament references clearly explaining that 1st-century Christians believed in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World's ending within the lifetime of Jesus's original followers.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Pcisys | url = http://home.pcisys.net/~jnf/schauth/rq2.html | title = Review of \"The Mystery of the Kingdom of God\"}}</ref> He noted that in the gospel of Mark, Jesus speaks of a \"tribulation\", with his \"coming in the clouds with great power and glory\" (St Mark), and states when it will happen: \"This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled\" (St Matthew, 24:34) (or, \"have taken place\" (Luke 21:32))\n\nIn ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', Schweitzer observes the Bible contradicting the possibility of important events that never took place and never can take place as they are described; Jesus specifically states that we are to \"not seal up the words of the prophecy\" and promises that some of his listeners as well as the high priest at his trial would be alive to see him return to the Earth. \"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near\" (Revelation 1:3). Saint Paul spoke of the \"last times\": \"Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none\" (1 Corinthians 7:29); \"God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son\" (Hebrews 1:2); \"There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom\" (Matthew 16:28) (or, \"until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power\" (Mark 9:1); or, \"till they see the kingdom of God\" (Luke 9:27).)\n\nSchweitzer continues writing in ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' that it is totally unreasonable to think that \"coming quickly\", \"near\", and \"soon\" could mean hundreds, much less thousands, of years in the future. \"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.\" (Revelation 1:3) \"And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place.\" \"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.\" And he said to me, \"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near\" (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). \"All these things shall come upon this generation\" (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.\n\nIn ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', Schweitzer notes the passage \"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.\" (Revelation 1:3) Similarly in St Peter: \"Christ .. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you\" (1 Peter 1:20), and \"But the end of all things is at hand\" (1 Peter 4:7). \"Surely I come quickly\" (Revelation 22:20). Schweitzer felt that St. Paul clearly believed in the immediacy of the [[Second Coming of Jesus]], in stark contrast to modern organized Christianity.\n\n[[File:The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle Book-Cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of Albert Schweitzer's ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'']]\n\n===''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (1931)''===\nIn ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'', Schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of [[mysticism]]: primitive and developed.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 1}} Primitive mysticism \"has not yet risen to a conception of the universal, and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super-earthly, temporal and eternal.\" Additionally, he argues that this view of a \"union with the divinity, brought about by efficacious ceremonies, is found even in quite primitive religions.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 1}}\n\nOn the other hand, a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the Greek mystery-cults that were popular in first-century A.D. society. These included the cults of [[Attis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Mithras]]. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the \"conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself.\" Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found \"among the [[Brahman]]s and in the [[Buddha]], in [[Platonism]], in [[Stoicism]], in [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Hegel]].\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 2}}\n\nNext, Schweitzer poses the question: \"Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul?\" He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of [[Adoption (theology)|sonship]] to God as \"mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 3}} He summarizes Pauline mysticism as \"being in Christ\" rather than \"being in God.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s imminent [[eschatology]] (from his background in [[Jewish eschatology]]) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible, which is in the near future.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}} Therefore, Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of \"being-in-God.\" Rather, Paul uses the phrase \"being-in-Christ\" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of \"being-in-Christ\" is not a \"static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again.\" The \"realistic\" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 13}}\n\nOne of Schweitzer's major arguments in ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle'' is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase \"being in Christ\", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading [[justification by faith]] as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by [[Martin Luther]], Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by \"being in Christ.\" [[Jaroslav Pelikan]], in his Forward to ''The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle,'' points out that:\n\n{{Quote|the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around: 'The doctrine of the redemption, which is mentally appropriated through faith, is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption-doctrine, which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = xvi}}}}\n\n====Paul's \"Realism\" versus Hellenistic \"Symbolism\"====\nSchweitzer contrasts Paul\u2019s \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ to the \"symbolism\" of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenism]]. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ rather than the \"symbolic\" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through [[deification]].{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 16}} After baptism, the Christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]]). On the other hand, the Hellenist \"lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation\" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 17}}\n\nAnother major difference between Paul's \"realism\" and Hellenistic \"symbolism\" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that \"Paul\u2019s thought follows [[Predestination|predestinarian]] lines.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 103}} He explains, \"only the man who is [[Election (Christianity)|elected]] thereto can enter into relation with God.\"{{Sfn | Schweitzer | 1931 | p = 9}} Although every human being is invited to become a Christian, only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through [[baptism]] can share in the \"realistic\" dying and rising with Christ.\n\n==Medicine==\nAt the age of 30, in 1905, Schweitzer answered the call of The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris, which was looking for a [[medical doctor]]. However, the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be \"incorrect\".<!-- Wouldn't the fact that Schweitzer wasn't a physician be an equally likely reason? -->{{sfn|Seaver|1951|p=40}} He could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.\n\nEven in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus''. He defended [[Mental health of Jesus|Jesus\u2032 mental health]] in it. In June 1912, he married [[Helene Bresslau Schweitzer|Helene Bresslau]], municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian [[Harry Bresslau]].<ref name = \"Marxsen\">Marxsen, Patti M. ''Helene Schweitzer: A Life of Her Own.'' First Edition. Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] on the [[Ogoou\u00e9]] river, in what is now Gabon, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising, he was ready to equip a small hospital.<ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 1.</ref> In spring 1913, he and his wife set off to establish a hospital ([[Albert Schweitzer Hospital]]) near an existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft<ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapter 6.</ref>) upstream from the mouth of the Ogoou\u00e9 at [[Port Gentil]] ([[Cape Lopez]]) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9.\n[[File:Bassin versant de l'Ogoou\u00e9-fr.svg|thumb|right|200px|The catchment area of the Ogoo\u00e9 occupies most of Gabon. [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] is marked.]]\nIn the first nine months, he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries, he was often treating severe [[sandflea]] and crawcraw sores, ''[[framboesia]]'' (yaws), tropical [[Ulcer (dermatology)|eating sores]], heart disease, tropical [[dysentery]], tropical [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[leprosy]], fevers, strangulated [[hernias]], [[necrosis]], abdominal tumours and chronic [[constipation]] and [[nicotine poisoning]], while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, [[fetishism]] and fear of [[cannibalism]] among the [[Ethnic groups in Gabon|Mbahouin]].\n\nSchweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking [[Galoa]] ([[Mpongwe]]) who first came as a patient.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Monfried|first1=Walter|title=Admirers Call Dr. Schweitzer \"Greatest Man in the World\"|date=February 10, 1947|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|pages=1, 3}}</ref><ref>''From the Primeval Forest'', Chapters 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, German citizens in a French colony when the countries were at war, were put under supervision by the French military at Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, where Schweitzer continued his work.<ref>[http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm Albert Schweitzer 1875\u20131965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214021148/http://www.schweitzer.org/german/as/asdbio.htm |date=14 December 2007 }}. schweitzer.org (in German)</ref> In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical [[anaemia]], they were taken to [[Bordeaux]] and interned first in [[Garaison]] and then from March 1918 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]. In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, ''The Decay and Restoration of Civilization'' and ''Civilization and Ethics''. The two remaining volumes, on ''The World-View of Reverence for Life '' and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.\n\nIn 1924 he returned without his wife, but with an Oxford undergraduate, [[Noel Gillespie]], as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had [[salvarsan]] for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann,<ref>Nessmann worked with the [[French Resistance]] during the Second World War, was captured and executed by the [[Gestapo]] in [[Limoges]] in 1944. cf Guy Penaud, ''Dictionnaire Biographique de P\u00e9rigord'', p. 713. {{ISBN|978-2-86577-214-8}}</ref> joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included [[Suramin|Germanin]] and [[tryparsamide]]. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera [[vibrion]] (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.\n\nHe was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937, he returned again to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 and continued working there throughout [[World War II]].\n\n==Schweitzer's views==\n===Colonialism===\nSchweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus' call to become \"fishers of men\" but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European [[colonialism|colonizers]]:<ref>{{Citation | last = Schweitzer | first = Albert | author-link = Albert Schweitzer | title = On the Edge of the Primeval Forest | place = New York | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1931b | page = 115 | OCLC = 2097590}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they [the coloured peoples] have suffered at the hands of Europeans?... If a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races, it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible.}}\n\nSchweitzer was one of colonialism's harshest critics. In a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905, before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in Africa, he said:{{sfn|Schweitzer|2005|p=76\u201380}}\n\n{{quote|Our culture divides people into two classes: civilized men, a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying; and others, who have only the human form, who may perish or go to the dogs for all the 'civilized men' care.''\n\nOh, this 'noble' culture of ours! It speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot, only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves. This culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is, how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there, and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights...\n\nI will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice. People robbed native inhabitants of their land, made slaves of them, let loose the scum of mankind upon them. Think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us, how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic 'gifts', and everything else we have done... We decimate them, and then, by the stroke of a pen, we take their land so they have nothing left at all...\n\nIf all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God, or the American God, or the British God, and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be 'Christian'\u2014then the name of Jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery. And the Christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people. The name of Jesus has become a curse, and our Christianity\u2014yours and mine\u2014has become a falsehood and a disgrace, if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated. For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus' name, someone must step in to help in Jesus' name; for every person who robbed, someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed, someone must bless.\n\nAnd now, when you speak about missions, let this be your message: We must make atonement for all the terrible crimes we read of in the newspapers. We must make atonement for the still worse ones, which we do not read about in the papers, crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night...}}\n\n===Paternalism===\nSchweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being [[Paternalism|paternalistic]], [[Colonialism|colonialist]], and [[Racism|racist]] in his attitude towards Africans, and in some ways his views did differ from that of many [[Liberalism|liberals]] and other critics of colonialism.{{sfn|Brabazon|2000|p=253-256}} For instance, he thought that Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances.

And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reverence for life==\n{{Main|Reverence for Life}}\n[[File:Albert Schweitzer 1955.jpg|thumb|Schweitzer in 1955]]\nThe keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of ''[[Reverence for Life]]'' (\"''Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben''\"). He thought that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its [[Ethics|ethical]] foundation.\n\nIn the Preface to ''Civilization and Ethics'' (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming optimism of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], expressed in the [[Pessimism|pessimist]] philosophies from [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] onward. Scientific [[materialism]] (advanced by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.\n\nSchweitzer wrote, \"True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.'\"<ref>''Civilization and Ethics'', Chapter 21, p. 253: reprinted as A. Schweitzer, ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', ([[Prometheus Books]], Buffalo 1987), Chapter 26.</ref> In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.\n\nThough we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian [[Brahmin]]ic philosophy.\n\nFor Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.<ref>''Civilization and Ethics'', Preface and Chapter II, 'The Problem of the Optimistic World-View'.</ref>\n\nSuch was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development of reverence for life, was influenced by [[Indian religions|Indian religious]] thought and in particular the [[Jainism|Jain]] principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]], or non-violence.<ref>Ara Paul Barsam (2002) \"Albert Schweitzer, jainism and reverence for life\" in:''Reverence for life: the ethics of Albert Schweitzer for the twenty-first century'' Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2977-1}} pp.&nbsp;207\u201308</ref> Albert Schweitzer noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book ''Indian Thought and Its Development'':<ref>Albert Schweitzer and Charles Rhind Joy (1947) ''Albert Schweitzer: an anthology'' Beacon Press</ref>\n{{Quote|The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought&nbsp;\u2013 and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far&nbsp;\u2013 reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Albert-Schweitzer-Haus.jpg|thumb|right|The Schweitzer house and Museum at K\u00f6nigsfeld in the Black Forest]]\nAfter the birth of their daughter ([[Rhena Schweitzer Miller]]), Albert's wife, Helene Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 due to her health. In 1923 the family moved to [[K\u00f6nigsfeld im Schwarzwald]], Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where he was building a house for the family.

Three years after the end of World War II, in 1948, he returned for the first time to Europe and kept traveling back and forth (and once to the US) as long as he was able. During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach, Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house, which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work. His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie ''Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer'', starring [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Albert Schweitzer and [[Jeanne Moreau]] as his nurse Marie. Schweitzer inspired actor [[Hugh O'Brian]] when O'Brian visited in Africa. O'Brian returned to the United States and founded the [[Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation]] (HOBY).\n[[File:Albert Schweitzer.jpg|thumb|Albert Schweitzer Monument in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], Australia]]\nSchweitzer was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] of 1952,<ref>{{cite web | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1952 | website=The Nobel Foundation | date=21 May 2014 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/ | access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> accepting the prize with the speech, \"The Problem of Peace\".{{sfn|Schweitzer|1954}} From 1952 until his death he worked against [[nuclear tests]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s with [[Albert Einstein]], [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].

In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of [[Peace Action|The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]]. On 23 April 1957, Schweitzer made his \"Declaration of Conscience\" speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old [[Queen's Hall]] in London. These records did not satisfy him, the instrument being too harsh.

Known as \"The Schweitzer Technique\", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a [[Microphone#Bi-directional|figure-8 microphone]] pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single [[Microphone#Cardioid|cardioid microphone]] is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm [[Microphone#Condenser microphone|condenser microphones]] pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Columbia recordings===\nAltogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of C\u00e9sar Franck.

In 1883, Menger published ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', which attacked the methods of the historical school. [[Gustav von Schmoller]], a leader of the historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term \"Austrian School\" in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial.<ref>\"Menger\u2019s approach \u2013 haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely \u201cAustrian,\u201d the origin of that label \u2013 led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.\" [[Peter G.

[[Carl Menger]]'s 1871 book ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]'' is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of [[marginal utility]]. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics.<ref name=keizer>{{cite book |last=Keizer |first=Willem |title=Austrian Economics in Debate |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14054-6 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2011}} While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the \"Psychological School\", \"Vienna School\", or \"Austrian School\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kirzner | first1 = Israel M. | year = 1987 | title = Austrian School of Economics | url = | journal = [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]] | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 145\u201351 }}</ref>\n\nMenger's contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. These three economists became what is known as the \"first wave\" of the Austrian School. B\u00f6hm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of [[Karl Marx]] in the 1880s and 1890s as was part of the Austrians' participation in the late 19th-century ''[[Methodenstreit]]'', during which they attacked the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] doctrines of the [[Historical school of economics|historical school]].\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[Frank Albert Fetter]] (1863\u20131949) was a leader in the United States of Austrian thought.

Austrian economist [[Walter Block]] says that the Austrian School can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories\u2014economic theory and political theory.

Groups don't think; people think.\n* Methodological subjectivism: in the explanation of economic phenomena, we have to go back to judgments and choices made by individuals on the basis of whatever knowledge they have or believe to have and whatever expectations they entertain regarding external developments and especially the perceived consequences of their own intended actions.\n* Tastes and preferences: subjective valuations of goods and services determine the demand for them so that their prices are influenced by (actual and potential) consumers.\n* [[Opportunity cost]]s: the costs with which producers and other economic actors calculate reflect the alternative opportunities that must be foregone; as productive services are employed for one purpose, all alternative uses have to be sacrificed.\n* [[Marginalism]]: in all economic designs, the values, costs, revenues, productivity and so on are determined by the significance of the last unit added to or subtracted from the total.\n* Time structure of production and consumption: decisions to save reflect \"time preferences\" regarding  consumption in the immediate, distant, or indefinite future and investments are made in view of larger outputs expected to be obtained if more time-taking production processes are undertaken.\n\nHe included two additional tenets held by the Mises branch of Austrian economics:\n* [[Consumer sovereignty]]: the influence consumers have on the effective demand for goods and services and through the prices which result in free competitive markets, on the production plans of producers and investors, is not merely a hard fact but also an important objective, attainable only by complete avoidance of governmental interference with the markets and of restrictions on the freedom of sellers and buyers to follow their own judgment regarding quantities, qualities and prices of products and services.\n* [[Individualism|Political individualism]]: only when individuals are given full economic freedom will it be possible to secure political and moral freedom. Restrictions on economic freedom lead, sooner or later, to an extension of the coercive activities of the state into the political domain, undermining and eventually destroying the essential individual liberties which the capitalistic societies were able to attain in the 19th century.\n\n== Contributions to economic thought ==\n=== Opportunity cost ===\n{{main|Opportunity cost}}\n[[File:1wieser.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Friedrich von Wieser]]]]\nThe opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] in the late 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Subjectivism, intelligibility and economic understanding: essays in honor of Ludwig M.

Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy. Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and [[price discovery]] processes by which individuals act on their personal information, Hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions.  Those who agree with this criticism view it as a refutation of socialism, showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization.

Mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called \"[[malinvestment]]\".\n\n==== Role of government disputed ====\nAccording to [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[central bank]]s enable the [[commercial bank]]s to fund loans at artificially low interest rates, thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[America's Great Depression]]'', [[Murray Rothbard]]</ref> [[Friedrich Hayek]] disagreed.

I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.<ref>Interview in ''Barron's Magazine'', August 24, 1998 archived at Hoover Institution {{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/6459 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231213357/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/6459 |archivedate=2013-12-31 |df= }}</ref>}}\n\n==== Empirical objections ====\nMilton Friedman after examining the history of business cycles in the United States wrote that there \"appears to be no systematic connection between the size of an expansion and of the succeeding contraction\", and that further analysis could cast doubt on business cycle theories which rely on this premise.<ref name=Friedman1969/><ref name=\"Friedman93\"/> Referring to Friedman's discussion of the business cycle, Austrian economist Roger Garrison argued that Friedman's empirical findings are \"broadly consistent with both Monetarist and Austrian views\" and goes on to argue that although Friedman's model \"describes the economy's performance at the highest level of aggregation, Austrian theory offers an insightful account of the market process that might underlie those aggregates\".<ref>{{Cite web |author=Auburn User |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/fm1pluck.htm |title=Plucking Model |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=1982-10-25 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055525/http://www.auburn.edu/%7Egarriro/fm1pluck.htm |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criticism of the Federal Reserve]]<ref name=\"Paul2009\">{{cite book|author=Ron Paul|title=End the Fed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3vkxGyQ-BQC&l%22all%20the%20Austrian%20school%20economists%20agree%20as%20well%20that%20the%20Fed%20was%20the%20cause%20of%20the%20Depression%22|date=2009|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}</ref>\n* [[List of Austrian intellectual traditions]]\n* [[List of Austrian School economists]]\n* [[Perspectives on capitalism by school of thought]]\n* [[New institutional economics]]\n* [[School of Salamanca]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Agafonow|first1=Alejandro|year=2012|title=The Austrian Dehomogenization Debate, or the Possibility of a Hayekian Planner|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/revpoe/v24y2012i2p273-287.html|journal=Review of Political Economy|volume=24|issue=2}}\n* Harald Hagemann, Tamotsu Nishizawa, and Yukihiro Ikeda, eds.

Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, bring more rapid healing, or lead to fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

In one study of 143 pediatric outcomes, a failure rate of 1.4% was reported in the loop group versus 10.5% in the packing group (P<.030),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ladde JG, Baker S, Rodgers CN, Papa L |title=The LOOP technique: a novel incision and drainage technique in the treatment of skin abscesses in a pediatric ED |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=271\u201376 |year=2015 |pmid=25435407 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2014.10.014 }}</ref> while a separate study reported a 5.5% failure rate among loop patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsoraides SS, Pearl RH, Stanfill AB, Wallace LJ, Vegunta RK |title=Incision and loop drainage: a minimally invasive technique for subcutaneous abscess management in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=606\u201309 |year=2010 |pmid=20223328 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.06.013 }}</ref>\n\n===Primary closure===\nClosing an abscess immediately after draining it appears to speed healing without increasing the risk of recurrence.<ref name=Singer2011/> This may not apply to anorectal abscesses.

[[Latin]] medical [[aphorism]] \"''[[ubi pus, ibi evacua]]''\" expresses \"where there is pus, there evacuate it\" and is classical advice in the culture of Western medicine.\n\n[[Needle exchange

Encyclopedia, 'Abscess'.</ref>\n\nThe word carbuncle is believed to have originated from the Latin: ''carbunculus'', originally a small coal; diminutive of ''carbon-'', ''carbo'': charcoal or ember,

Municipality</ref>\n}}\n'''Aalborg Municipality''' is a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') in [[Region Nordjylland]] on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in northern [[Denmark]].<ref name=CVDE>Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 11.</ref>  The municipality straddles the [[Limfjord]], the waterway which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]] east-to-west, and which separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north-to-south. It has a land area of 1,143.99&nbsp;km\u00b2, population 197,426 (2010)<ref name=\"FOLK1: Population 1 January\"/> and belongs to [[Region Nordjylland]] (\"North Jutland Region\").\n\nIt is also the name of the municipality's main city [[Aalborg]] and the site of its municipal council, as well as the name of a [[seaport]].\n\nThe municipality and the town have chosen to retain the traditional spelling of the name as ''Aalborg'', although the new spelling ''\u00c5lborg'' is used in other contexts, such as \u00c5lborg [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (''\u00c5lborg Bugt''), the body of water which lies to the east of the Jutland peninsula.\n\n==Municipal reform of 2007==\nAs of 1 January 2007 Aalborg municipality joined with the municipalities of [[Hals Municipality|Hals]], [[Nibe]], and [[Sejlflod]] to form a new Aalborg municipality. The former Aalborg municipality, including the island of [[Egholm]], covered an area of {{convert|560|km2|abbr=on}}, with a total population of 192,353 (2005).  Its last mayor was Henning G. Jensen, a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]]. The former municipality was bordered by Sejlflod and Hals to the east, [[Dronninglund]] and [[Br\u00f8nderslev]] to the north, [[Aabybro]] and Nibe to the west, and [[St\u00f8vring]] and [[Sk\u00f8rping]] to the south. It belonged to [[North Jutland County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Surroundings===\nThe waters in the [[Limfjord]] splitting the municipality are called ''Langerak'' to the east and ''[[Gj\u00f8l Bredning]]'' to the west.  The island of [[Egholm]] is located in ''Gj\u00f8l Bredning'', and is connected by [[ferry]] to the city of Aalborg at its southern shore.\n\nThe area is typical for the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake (salt water), with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is [[Store Vildmose]] (\"Greater Wild bog\"), a swamp where a mirage is sometimes seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]] (\"Lesser Wild bog\").  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest [[Bog|moor]] in Denmark.\n\n===Urban areas in Aalborg Municipality===\n[[Aalborg]] City has a total population at 123,432. The [[metropolitan area]] is a [[conurbation]] of the Aalborg urban area in [[Himmerland]] (102,312) and the [[N\u00f8rresundby]] urban area in [[Vendsyssel]] (21,120).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" colspan=\"5\" align=center | '''The largest urban areas in Aalborg Municipality'''<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&PLanguage=1 Danmarks Statistikbank<!-- Bot genereret titel -->]</ref>\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

It is located on the east coast of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, {{convert|187|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]] and {{convert|289|km}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany. The inner urban area contains 273,077 inhabitants ({{as of|2018|01|01|lc=on}}) and the municipal population is 340,421 ({{as of|2018|lc=on}}).<ref name=\"DSPopulation\"/> Aarhus is the central city in the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]], which had a total population of 1.378&nbsp;million in 2016.<ref name=\"East Jutland\">{{cite web|title=Tal og statistik|trans-title=Figures and Statistics|url=http://www.byregionoestjylland.dk/Statistik.html|publisher=Byregion \u00d8stjylland|accessdate=25 April 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nThe history of Aarhus began as a fortified [[Viking]] settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the [[bishopric]] seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of [[F\u00f6rden and East Jutland Fjorde|a fjord]] at a [[natural harbour]] and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. [[Market town]] privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17th&nbsp;century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)|Swedish Wars]]. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig Wars]] but avoided destruction. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.\n\nToday, Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the [[European Union]], and as [[List of largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|number 234]] among [[world cities]]. It is also a top 100 [[Meeting|conference]] city in the world.<ref>http://www.iccaworld.com/dcps/doc.cfm?docid=1696.</ref> Aarhus is the principal industrial port of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in [[Kattegat]]. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in [[Region Midtjylland]]. It is a centre for research and education in the [[Nordic countries]] and home to [[Aarhus University]], [[Scandinavia]]'s largest university, including [[Aarhus University Hospital]] and [[INCUBA Science Park]]. Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics, with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18,<ref name=\"DSPopulation\"/> Aarhus is also the second fastest growing Danish city, with an average growth of 4,500 people per annum since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/02|title=Statistikbanken|website=www.statistikbanken.dk}}</ref>\n\nAarhus is known for its musical history. In the 1950s many [[jazz]] clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]] and [[Gnags]]. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]], the [[Spot (music festival)|SPoT Festival]] and the [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|NorthSide Festival]].\n\nIn 2017, Aarhus was [[European Capital of Culture]] along with [[Paphos]] in Cyprus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus2017.dk/en/|title=Aarhus 2017 - European Capital of Culture|website=www.aarhus2017.dk}}</ref> In August 2018, Aarhus hosted the [[Sailing World Championships|Hempel Sailing World Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus2018.com/|title=Hempel Sailing World Championships Aarhus 2018|website=Aarhus 2018 Sailing World Championships}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Valdemar's Census Book]] (1231) the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic it was known as {{lang|is|Aros}}, later written as Aars.<ref name=Salmonsen>{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/1/0067.html |title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / Anden Udgave |page=53 |publisher=[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon|Salmonsen]] |accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish }}</ref> It is a compound of the two words {{lang|non|\u00e1r}}, genitive of {{wikt-lang|non|\u00e1}} (\"river\", Modern Danish {{lang|da|\u00e5}}), and {{lang|non|oss}} (\"mouth\", in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for \"river delta\").<ref name=dsd>{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus |title=Aarhus |publisher=[[Gyldendal]] |accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish }}</ref> The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of {{lang|da|Aarhus \u00c5|italic=no}} ([[Aarhus River]]).<ref name=\"The Aarhus River\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/east-jutland/history/aarhus-aa |publisher=Visit Aarhus |title=The Aarhus River |accessdate=26 June 2016 |language=Danish }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/vikings/history-of-aarhus |publisher=Visit Aarhus |title=History of Aarhus |accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref> The spelling \"Aarhus\" is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th&nbsp;century.<ref name=Salmonsen/>\n\n===Spelling===\nWith the [[\u00c5#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]], \"Aa\" was changed to \"\u00c5\".

Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably [[Aarhus Cathedral]] was initiated in the late 12th&nbsp;century by the influential bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]. In 1441, [[Christopher III]] issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th&nbsp;century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus's birth certificate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/%C3%85rhus_k%C3%B8bstads_privilegium |title=Stenbroen |website=AarhusWiki |publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv |language=Danish |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts are still in existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city, including the streets of [[Volden, Aarhus|Volden]] (The Rampart) and [[Graven, Aarhus|Graven]] (The Moat).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm |title=The Moat |language=Danish |publisher=The Viking Museum |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Historien_om_Aarhus |title=Historien om Aarhus |language=Danish |publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th&nbsp;century. In 1657, [[octroi]] was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades.

The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining [[boulder clay]].

Amateurs and their pursuits are also described as popular, informal, self-taught, user-generated, DIY, and hobbyist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.berkeley.edu/amateurism-across-the-arts-march-9/|title=Amateurism Across the Arts|website=arts.berkeley.edu|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, the amateur was considered to be the ideal balance between pure intent, open mind and the interest or passion for a subject. That ideology spanned many different fields of interest. It may have had its roots in the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] of having [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] compete in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. The ancient Greek citizens would spend most of their time in other pursuits, but would compete according to their natural talents and abilities.\n\nThe \"gentleman amateur\" was a phenomenon especially among the [[gentry]] of [[Great Britain]] from the 17th century until even the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Duncan|title=Deconstructing the Gentleman Amateur (article version)|url=https://www.academia.edu/34556804/Deconstructing_the_Gentleman_Amateur_article_version_|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=May 16, 2018|language=en}}</ref> With the start of the [[Age of Reason]], with people thinking more about how the world works around them, (see [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment]]), things like the [[Cabinet of Curiosities]], and the writing of the book ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'', started to shape the idea of the gentleman amateur. He was a person who was vastly interested in a particular topic and would study, observe, and collect things and information on his topic of choice. The [[Royal Society]] in Great Britain was generally composed of these \"gentleman amateurs\" and arguably is one the reasons science today exists the way it does. A few examples of these gentleman amateurs are [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]].\n\nAmateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often do not have formal training, some amateur work may be considered sub-par. For example, amateur athletes in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]] or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as having a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.  An amateur who dabbles in a field out of interest rather than as a profession, or who possesses a general but superficial interest in any art or a branch of knowledge, is often referred to as a [[wiktionary:dilettante|dilettante]].\n\n== Amateur athletics ==\n{{main|Amateur sports}}\nThe line between ''amateur'' and ''professional'' has always been blurred in athletics with the central idea being that amateurs should not receive material reward for taking part in sports.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=Amateurism and professionalism \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/amateurism-and-professionalism/page-1|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is amateurism?|url=https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|website=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> The lack of financial benefit can be seen as a sign of [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to a sport; until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs.

Alexis Carrel was also a member of [[learned societies]] in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]], [[Princeton University]], California, New York, [[Brown University]] and [[Columbia University]].\n\nIn 1902, he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of Marie Bailly at [[Lourdes]], made famous in part because she named Carrel as a witness of her cure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} After the notoriety surrounding the event, Carrel could not obtain a hospital appointment because of the pervasive anticlericalism in the French university system at the time. In 1903 he emigrated to Montreal, Canada, but soon relocated to Chicago, Illinois to work for Hull Laboratory. While there he collaborated with American physician [[Charles Claude Guthrie]] in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the [[head transplant|head]], and Carrel was awarded the 1912 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for these efforts.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1912/index.html Nobelprize.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1906 he joined the newly formed [[Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research]] in New York where he spent the rest of his career.<ref name=\"Reggiani\">Reggiani</ref> There he did significant work on tissue cultures with pathologist [[Montrose Thomas Burrows]]. In the 1930s, Carrel and [[Charles Lindbergh]] became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal, political, and social views. Lindbergh initially sought out Carrel to see if his sister-in-law's heart, damaged by [[rheumatic fever]], could be repaired. When Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carrel's machinery, he offered to build new equipment for the scientist. Eventually they built the first perfusion pump, an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery. Lindbergh considered Carrel his closest friend, and said he would preserve and promote Carrel's ideals after his death.<ref name=\"Reggiani\"/>\n\nDue to his close proximity with [[Jacques Doriot]]'s fascist [[Parti Populaire Fran\u00e7ais]] (PPF) during the 1930s and his role in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France, he was accused after the Liberation of collaboration, but died before the trial.\n\nIn his later life he returned to his Catholic roots. In 1939 he met with [[Trappist monk]] Alexis Presse on a recommendation. Although Carrel was skeptical about meeting with a priest,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Jaki</ref> Presse ended up having a profound influence on the rest of Carrel's life.<ref name=\"Reggiani\"/> In 1942, he said \"I believe in the existence of God, in the immortality of the soul, in Revelation and in all the Catholic Church teaches.\" He summoned Presse to administer the Catholic [[Sacrament]]s on his death bed in November 1944.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFor much of his life, Carrel and his wife spent their summers on the [[:fr:\u00cele Saint-Gildas|\u00cele Saint-Gildas]], which they owned. After he and Lindbergh became close friends, Carrel persuaded him to also buy a neighboring island, the [[Ile Illiec]], where the Lindberghs often resided in the late 1930s.<ref name=Friedman>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=David M.|title=The Immortalists: Charles Lindbergh, Dr. Alexis Carrel, and Their Daring Quest to Live Forever|year=2007|publisher=Ecco/HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-052815-7|pages=140|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/The-Immortalists-David-M-Friedman/?isbn=9780060528157}}</ref>\n\n== Contributions to science ==\n\n=== Vascular suture ===\nCarrel was a young surgeon in 1894, when the French president [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was assassinated with a knife. Carnot bled to death due to severing of his portal vein, and surgeons who treated the president felt that the vein could not be successfully reconnected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sade|first=Robert M.|title=Transplantation at 100 Years: Alexis Carrel, Pioneer Surgeon|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003497505016024|journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery|volume=80|issue=6|pages=2415\u20132418|doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.08.074|year=2005}}</ref> This left a deep impression on Carrel, and he set about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels. The technique of \"triangulation\", using three stay-sutures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during suturing, was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress and is still used today. Julius Comroe wrote: \"Between 1901 and 1910, Alexis Carrel, using experimental animals, performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today.\" He had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins, and performing surgical grafts, and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912.<ref name=simmons>{{Cite journal | title = Doctors and discoveries: lives that created today's medicine | author1=John G.

For this, Carrel was awarded the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]].\n\n=== Organ transplants ===\nCarrel co-authored a book with famed pilot [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], ''The Culture of Organs'', and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the \"perfusion pump,\" which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of [[open-heart surgery]] and [[organ transplants]], and to have laid the groundwork for the [[artificial heart]], which became a reality decades later.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/innovators/bio_carrel2.html Red Gold .

This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]], and is now a pillar of biology.<ref name=\"Fossel2004\"/>\n\nL. Hayflick has shown that a cell has a limited number of divisions, equal to the so called \"Hayflick\u2019s Limit.\" However, L. Franks and others (Loo et al. 1987; Nooden and Tompson 1995; Frolkis 1988a), have shown that the number of cell divisions can be considerably greater than that stipulated by the \"Hayflick Limit\", having practically no limit at all.\n\nIt is not certain how Carrel obtained his anomalous results.

After the first six months, Carrel's colleague Albert Ebeling had actually taken charge of the cultures and published several papers about their development, until they were eventually discarded in 1946. Witkowski, in \"Dr. Carrel's immortal cells\", op. cit., quotes Buchbaum's account. At the end Buchbaum writes that \"I told this story, of my visit to Carrel's laboratory, to various people. Dr. Bloom (''Buchbaum's director of research in Chicago'')refused to believe it. Others chuckled gleefully. Dr. Carrel was to blame only in that he did not keep on top of what was really going on in the laboratory (mostly, he wrote the papers). Dr. Parker and Dr. Ebeling probably suspected something, hence the \"retirement\". In the interest of truth and science, the incident should have been thoroughly investigated. If it had been, some heads might have rolled, sacrificed to devotion to a wrong hypothesis - immortality of cell strains.\". Witkowski also reports Dr. Margaret Murray, an early tissue culturist, telling him that \"one of Carrel's technicians of that time was passionately anti-fascist and detested Carrel's political and social ideas\" and expressing her belief that \"this technician would willingly have discredited Carrel scientifically if possible.\".</ref>\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html The Nobel Stamps of 1972<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205201406/http://nobelprize.org/nobel/stamps/1972.html |date=February 5, 2006 }}</ref> In 1979, the [[lunar crater]] [[Carrel (crater)|Carrel]] was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.\n\nIn February 2002, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize,<ref>[http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/prize.htm Charles Lindbergh Symposium<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004947/http://research.musc.edu/lindbergh/prize.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> given to major contributors to \"development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth\".

It was in fact Lindbergh's disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lindbergh's first contact with Carrel.\n\n== Alexis Carrel and Lourdes ==\n\nIn 1902 Alexis Carrel went from being a skeptic of the visions and miracles reported at [[Lourdes]] to being a believer in spiritual cures after experiencing a healing of Marie Bailly that he could not explain.<ref name=\"Jaki\">Rev. [[Stanley Jaki]] [https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=2866 Two Lourdes Miracles and a Nobel Laureate: What Really Happened?]</ref>  The Catholic journal ''Le nouvelliste'' reported that she named him as the prime witness of her cure.  Alexis Carrel refused to discount a supernatural explanation and steadfastly reiterated his beliefs, even writing a book describing his experience,<ref>Alexis Carrel, ''The Voyage to Lourdes'' (New York, Harper & Row, 1939).</ref> though it was not published until four years after his death. This was a detriment to his career and reputation among his fellow doctors, and feeling he had no future in academic medicine in France, he emigrated to Canada with the intention of farming and raising cattle. After a brief period, he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago<ref name=simmons/> and two years later at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research.\n\n== ''Man, The Unknown'' (1935, 1939) ==\n{{Main|Man, The Unknown}}\nIn 1935, Carrel published a book titled ''L'Homme, cet inconnu'' (''Man, The Unknown''),<ref name=\"Carrel\">{{cite book|last1=Carrel|first1=Alexis|title=Man, The Unknown|date=1939|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|url=http://hpaba.com/pages/en/ALEXIS%20CARREL%20Man%20the%20Unknown%201935.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> which became a best-seller. In the book, he attempted to outline a comprehensive account what is known and more importantly unknown of the human body and human life \"in light of discoveries in biology, physics, and medicine\",<ref name=simmons/> to elucidate problems of the modern world, and to provide possible routes to a better life for human beings.\n\nFor Carrel, the fundamental problem was that:\n\n<blockquote>[M]en cannot follow modern civilization along its present course, because they are degenerating. They have been fascinated by the beauty of the sciences of inert matter. They have not understood that their body and consciousness are subjected to natural laws, more obscure than, but as inexorable as, the laws of the sidereal world. Neither have they understood that they cannot transgress these laws without being punished. They must,  therefore, learn the necessary relations of the cosmic universe, of their fellow men, and of their inner selves, and also those of their tissues and their mind. Indeed, man stands above all things. Should he degenerate, the beauty of civilization, and even the grandeur of the physical universe, would vanish. ... Humanity\u2019s attention must turn from the machines of the world of inanimate matter to the body and the soul of man, to the organic and mental processes which have created the machines and the universe of Newton and Einstein.<ref name=Unknown>Alexis Carrel: ''Man, The Unknown''. Doubleday, NY 1935</ref><ref>http://communication.ucsd.edu/_files/Korzybski_The-Science-of-Man.pdf</ref></blockquote>\n\nCarrell advocated, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals, and by incorporating eugenics into the social framework. He argued for an aristocracy springing from individuals of potential, writing:\n\n<blockquote>We must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.<ref name=Unknown/></blockquote>\n\nCarrel advocated the use of [[gas chambers|gasses]] to rid humanity of \"defectives\", thus endorsing the [[scientific racism]] [[discourse]]. His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930s, prior to the [[Nazi]] implementation of such practices in Germany. In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publisher's request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages:\n\n<blockquote>(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.<ref>As quoted by Andr\u00e9s Horacio Reggiani: ''God's eugenicist. Alexis Carrel and the sociobiology of decline.'' Berghahn Books, Oxford 2007, p. 71. See ''Der Mensch, das unbekannte Wesen''. DVA, Stuttgart 1937.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the insane and the criminal, he endorsed the use of gassing for euthanasia: \n\n<blockquote>(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts..<ref name=Unknown/></blockquote>\n\nOtherwise he endorsed voluntary positive eugenics. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>We have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved through the efforts of hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.<ref name=Unknown/></blockquote>\n\nHe continued:\n\n{{quote|The progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of [[industrial civilization]]. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.\n\nThe free practice of eugenics could lead not only to the development of stronger individuals, but also of strains endowed with more endurance, intelligence, and courage. These strains should constitute an aristocracy, from which great men would probably appear. Modern society must promote, by all possible means, the formation of better human stock. No financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who, through the wisdom of their marriage, would engender geniuses. The complexity of our civilization is immense. No one can master all its mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have to be mastered. There is need today of men of larger mental and moral size, capable of accomplishing such a task. The establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems.<ref name=Unknown/>}}\n\n== French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems ==\nIn 1937, Carrel joined [[Jean Coutrot]]\u2019s ''Centre d\u2019Etudes des Probl\u00e8mes Humains'' - Coutrot\u2019s aim was to develop what he called an \"economic humanism\" through \"collective thinking.\" In 1941, through connections to the cabinet of [[Vichy France]] president [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (specifically, French industrial physicians [[Andr\u00e9 Gros]] and Jacques M\u00e9n\u00e9trier) he went on to advocate for the creation of the ''Fondation Fran\u00e7aise pour l\u2019Etude des Probl\u00e8mes Humains'' (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems) which was created by [[decree]] of the Vichy regime in 1941, and where he served as 'regent'.<ref name=\"Andr\u00e9s Horacio Reggiani p. 107\"/>\n\nThe foundation was at the origin of the October 11, 1946, law, enacted by the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF), which institutionalized the field of [[occupational medicine]]. It worked on [[demographics]] (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois-Pichat), on [[economics]], ([[Fran\u00e7ois Perroux]]), on [[nutrition]] (Jean Sutter), on habitation (Jean Merlet) and on the first [[opinion poll]]s (Jean Stoetzel). \"The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health.

The institute also conceived the \"scholar book\" (\"livret scolaire\"), which could be used to record students' grades in the French secondary schools, and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance.<ref>[http://fhs.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/2/331  (Reggiani)]</ref>\n\nAccording to Gwen Terrenoire, writing in ''Eugenics in France (1913-1941) : a review of research findings'', \"The foundation was a pluridisciplinary centre that employed around 300 researchers (mainly statisticians, psychologists, physicians) from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944.

Its teaching is based also on the practice of prayer for the dead mentioned as far back as 2 Maccabees 12:42\u201346.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|publisher=www.vatican.va}}</ref> In the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the dead in the inscriptions of the [[catacomb]]s, with their constant prayers for the peace of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies, which commonly contain commemorations of the dead. Tertullian, Cyprian and other early Western Fathers witness to the regular  practice of praying for the dead among the early Christians.<ref name=\"ODCC\">''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article \"dead, prayer for the\"</ref> The theological basis for the feast is the doctrine that the souls which, on departing from the body, are not perfectly cleansed from venial sins, or have not fully atoned for past transgressions, are debarred from the Beatific Vision, and that the faithful on earth can help them by prayers, alms deeds and especially by the sacrifice of the Mass.<ref name=\"Mershman\">{{catholic|wstitle=All Souls' Day|inline=1|volume=1|year=1907|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> Because [[Purgatory]] is outside of time and space, it is not necessarily accurate to speak of a location or duration in Purgatory.\n\n====History====\nIn the sixth century, it was customary in Benedictine monasteries to hold a commemoration of the deceased members at Whitsuntide. According to [[Widukind of Corvey]] (c. 975), there existed a time-honoured ceremony of praying to the dead on 1 October in Saxony.<ref name=Mershman/> But it was the day after [[All Saints' Day]] that Saint [[Odilo of Cluny]] chose when in the 11th century he instituted for all the monasteries dependent on the [[Abbey of Cluny]] an annual commemoration of all the faithful departed, to be observed with alms, prayers, and sacrifices for the relief of the suffering souls in purgatory.<ref name=Butler>[http://catholicsaints.info/butlers-lives-of-the-saints-saint-odilo-or-olon-sixth-abbot-of-cluni/ Butler, Alban. \"Saint Odilo, or Olon, Sixth Abbot of Cluni\". ''Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints'', 1866]</ref> Odilo decreed that those requesting a Mass be offered for the departed should make an offering for the poor, thus linking almsgiving with fasting and prayer for the dead.

During World War I, given the great number of war dead and the many destroyed churches where mass could no longer be said, [[Pope Benedict XV]], granted all priests the privilege of offering three Masses on All Souls Day,<ref>[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/all-saints-and-all-souls.html Saunders, William. \"All Saints and All Souls\", ''Arlington Catholic Herald'', 2003]</ref> a permission that still stands. \n\nKnown as the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed, in some countries the celebration is known as the \"[[Day of the Dead]]\".\n\n====Liturgical practice====\nIn the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. While celebration of a Sunday, a solemnity or a feast of the Lord replacing a Sunday begins on the previous evening with Vespers and perhaps evening Mass, the general norms do not allow for anticipation on Saturday evening of the liturgy of All Souls' Day falling on a Sunday, and so they suggest that the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would be celebrated on that evening.<ref name=ZENIT/><ref>Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, \"Table of Liturgical Days\"]</ref>  However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls; in countries such as Italy the situation was less clear.<ref name=ZENIT14>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-day-and-the-vigil-mass|title=Edward McNamara, \"All Souls' Day and the Vigil Mass\"|date=29 October 2014 |work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.<ref name=ZENIT/> In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.<ref name=ZENIT14/> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.\n\nIn [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] the minor propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion) are those used for Renaissance and Classical musical [[requiem]] settings, including the [[Dies Irae]].  This permits the performance of traditional requiem settings in the context of the Divine Worship Form of the Roman Rite on All Souls Day as well as at funerals, votive celebrations of all faithful departed, and anniversaries of deaths.<ref>''Divine Worship: The Missal'', pp.871-875 & pp.1024-1032</ref>\n\n====All Souls' indulgence====\nAccording to The Enchiridion of Indulgences, \nAn indulgence, applicable only to the souls in purgatory, is granted to the faithful, who devoutly visit a cemetery and pray for the departed. The indulgence is plenary, under the usual conditions, each day from the first to the eighth of November; a partial indulgence is granted on any other days of the year.<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/prayers/indulgw.php \"The Enchiridion of Indulgences\", Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, 1968, #13]</ref>\n\n\"Visit to a Church or Oratory on All Souls Day.

The Roman custom was that of the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ovid|title=Fasti|page=V 419ff}}</ref>\n\nThe formal commemoration of the saints and martyrs ([[All Saints' Day]]) existed in the early Christian church since its [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|legalization]], and alongside that developed a day for commemoration of all the dead (All Souls' Day). The modern date of All Souls' Day was first popularized in the early eleventh century after [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo]] established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monasteries to pray for the souls in purgatory.<ref>{{Catholic|last=L\u00f6ffler|first=Klemens|wstitle=St. Odilo|volume=11|year=1911|accessdate=3 September 2017|prescript=}}</ref>\n\nMany of these European traditions reflect the dogma of [[purgatory]]. For example, ringing bells for the dead was believed to comfort them in their cleansing there, while the sharing of [[soul cakes]] with the poor helped to buy the dead a bit of respite from the suffering of purgatory. In the same way, lighting candles was meant to kindle a light for the dead souls languishing in the darkness. Out of this grew the traditions of \"going souling\" and the baking of special types of bread or cakes.<ref>Medieval Histories 2012: 11:1 http://medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/medievalhistories-november1.pdf</ref>\n\nIn [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\nIn [[Malta]], a traditional All Souls supper includes roasted pig, based on an All Souls\u2019 Day custom where the Maltese feasted on a pig let loose on the streets with a bell hanging around its neck.

He was a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], and won the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true [[French people|Gallic]] temperament\".\n\nFrance is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol Bergotte in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marcel Proust: A Life, by Edmund White |url=http://tenpagesormore.blogspot.com/2010/07/3-marcel-proust-life-by-edmund-white-pp.html }}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nThe son of a bookseller, France spent most of his life around books and was a [[bibliophile]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://benonsensical.com/blog/tag/famous-bibliophiles |title=Anatole France |work=benonsensical |date=24 July 2010 |access-date=30 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113174349/http://benonsensical.com/blog/tag/famous-bibliophiles |archive-date=13 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His father's bookstore, called the ''{{lang|fr|Librairie France}}'', specialized in books and papers on the [[French Revolution]] and was frequented by many notable writers and scholars of the day. France studied at the [[Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas de Paris|Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas]], a private Catholic school, and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore. After several years he secured the position of cataloguer at Bacheline-Deflorenne and at Lemerre. In 1876 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate.\n\n==Literary career==\nAnatole France began his literary career as a poet and a journalist. In 1869, ''Le Parnasse Contemporain'' published one of his poems, \"{{lang|fr|La Part de Madeleine|italic=unset}}\". In 1875, he sat on the committee which was in charge of the third ''Parnasse Contemporain'' compilation. As a journalist, from 1867, he wrote many articles and notices. He became famous with the novel ''{{lang|fr|Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard}}'' (1881). Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, embodied France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. [[File:Anatole France house, Villa Said.jpg|thumb|left|140px|France's home, 5 {{lang|fr|villa Sa\u00efd|italic=unset}}, 1894\u20131924]]\n\nIn ''{{lang|fr|La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque}}'' (1893) Anatole France ridiculed belief in the occult; and in ''{{lang|fr|Les Opinions de J\u00e9r\u00f4me Coignard}}'' (1893), France captured the atmosphere of the ''{{lang|fr|[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]}}''. France was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1896.\n\nAnatole France took an important part in the [[Dreyfus affair]]. He signed [[\u00c9mile Zola]]'s manifesto supporting [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of [[espionage]]. France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel ''Monsieur Bergeret''.\n\nFrance's later works include ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|L'\u00cele des Pingouins]]'' (''Penguin Island'', 1908) which satirizes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans \u2013 after the animals have been baptized by mistake by the nearsighted Abbot Mael. It is a satirical [[history of France]], starting in Medieval times, going on to the writer's own time with special attention to the [[Dreyfus Affair]] and concluding with a [[dystopia]]n future. ''{{lang|fr|[[The Gods Are Athirst|Les dieux ont soif]]}}'' (''The Gods Are Athirst'', 1912) is a novel, set in Paris during the [[French Revolution]], about a true-believing follower of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his contribution to the bloody events of the [[Reign of Terror]] of 1793\u201394. It is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time. ''[[Revolt of the Angels|La Revolte des Anges]]'' (''Revolt of the Angels'', 1914) is often considered Anatole France's most profound and ironic novel. Loosely based on the Christian understanding of the [[War in Heaven]], it tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Bored because Bishop d'Esparvieu is sinless, Arcade begins reading the bishop's books on theology and becomes an atheist. He moves to Paris, meets a woman, falls in love, and loses his virginity causing his wings to fall off, joins the revolutionary movement of angels, and meets the Devil, who realizes that if he overthrew God, he would become just like God. Arcade realizes that replacing God with another is meaningless unless \"in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy [[Demiurge|Ialdabaoth]].\" \"Ialdabaoth,\" according to France, is God's secret name and means \"the child who wanders.\"\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. He died in 1924 and is buried in the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery]] near Paris.\n\nOn 31 May 1922,  France's entire works were put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (Prohibited Books Index) of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/indexlibrorum.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: ''{{lang|la|Index librorum prohibitorum|nocat=y}}'', 1557\u20131966 (Index of Prohibited Books) |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=May 1998 |publisher=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]] ([[Fordham University]]) }}</ref> He regarded this as a \"distinction\".<ref>''Current Opinion'', September 1922, p. 295.</ref> This Index was abolished in 1966.\n\n==Private life==\nIn 1877, Anatole France married Val\u00e9rie Gu\u00e9rin de Sauville, a granddaughter of [[Jean-Urbain Gu\u00e9rin]] a [[miniaturist]] who painted Louis XVI,<ref name=\"Leduc2004\">{{cite book |author=\u00c9douard Leduc |title=Anatole France avant l'oubli |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRpAHOLmpF4C&pg=PA222 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=\u00c9ditions Publibook |isbn=978-2-7483-0397-1 |pages=219, 222\u2013}}</ref> and with whom he had a daughter, Suzanne, in 1881 (dec. 1918).

The author of \"more than fifty books,\" at the time of his death his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as \"France's greatest contemporary man of letters\" and \"judged the greatest French writer of this century by the literary cognoscenti.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andregide.org/remembrance/nytgide.html|title=new york time obituary|author=|date=|website=www.andregide.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nKnown for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced traducing of education and a narrow social [[moralism]]. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritan]]ical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gide in 1893]]\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family. His father was a [[University of Paris|Paris University]] professor of law who died in 1880. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]]. His paternal family traced its roots back to [[Italy]], with his ancestors, the Guido's, moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Protestantism during the 16th century, due to persecution.<ref>[[Wallace Fowlie]], ''Andr\u00e9 Gide: His Life and Art'', Macmillan (1965), p. 11</ref><ref>Pierre de Boisdeffre, ''Vie d'Andr\u00e9 Gide, 1869-1951: Andr\u00e9 Gide avant la fondation de la Nouvelle revue fran\u00e7aise (1869-1909)'', Hachette (1970), p. 29</ref><ref>[[Jean Delay]], ''La jeunesse d'Andr\u00e9 Gide'', Gallimard (1956), p. 55</ref>\n\nGide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andr\u00e9 Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'Andr\u00e9 Walter''), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, Gide travelled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.<ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by Andr\u00e9 Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"but when Ali \u2013 that was my little guide's name \u2013 led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country...As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back...I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation\"...\"I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.\" [p. 251]</ref>\n\nHe befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]].

In 1896, he became mayor of [[La Roque-Baignard]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in Normandy.\n\nIn 1901, Gide rented the property [[Maderia]] in [[St. Br\u00e9lade's Bay]] and lived there while residing in [[Jersey]]. This period, 1901\u201307, is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him.\n\nIn 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine ''[[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (''The New French Review'').<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html Andr\u00e9 Gide Biography]. nobelprize.org</ref> In 1916, [[Marc All\u00e9gret]], only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son &ndash; one of five children &ndash; of Elie All\u00e9gret, who years before had been hired by Gide's mother to tutor her son in light of his weak grades in school, after which he and Gide became fast friends; All\u00e9gret was best man at Gide's wedding. Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence \u2013 \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.\n\nIn the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]]. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between All\u00e9gret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n24/edmund-white/on-the-chance-that-a-shepherd-boy-|title=On the chance that a shepherd boy \u2026|first=Edmund|last=White|date=10 December 1998|publisher=|pages=3\u20136|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=London Review of Books}}</ref> and it was brief in the extreme. Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth \"La Dame Blanche\" (\"The White Lady\"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938. Later he explored their unconsummated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine, ''Et Nunc Manet in Te''.\n\nIn 1924, he published an autobiography, ''If it Die...'' (French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').\n\nIn the same year, he produced the first French language editions of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Lord Jim]]''.\n\nAfter 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.\n\n==Africa==\nFrom July 1926 to May 1927, he travelled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] colony with his lover [[Marc All\u00e9gret]]. Gide went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Ubangi-Shari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroon]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo (book)|Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''[[Return from Chad]]'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html|title=Andr\u00e9 Gide - Biographical|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''r\u00e9gime des Grandes Concessions''), ''i.e.,'' a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to [[slavery]]. The book had important influence on [[anti-colonialism]] movements in France and helped re-evaluate the [[Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation|impact of colonialism]].<ref>[http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC=31184/idR=219/idTC=3/idG=2 Voyage au Congo suivi du Retour du Tchad]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316041458/http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC%3D31184/idR%3D219/idTC%3D3/idG%3D2 |date=16 March 2007 }}, in ''[[Lire (magazine)|Lire]]'', July\u2013August 1995 {{fr icon}}</ref>\n\n==Russia==\nDuring the 1930s, he briefly became a communist, or more precisely, a [[Fellow traveller|fellow traveler]] (he never formally joined any communist party).

Moreover, no writer of such stature had led such an interesting life, a life accessibly interesting to us as readers of his autobiographical writings, his journal, his voluminous correspondence and the testimony of others. It was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation, but reflecting on that process in his journal, reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them; a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in Germany and England; who found daily nourishment in the Latin, French, English and German classics, and, for much of his life, in the Bible; [who enjoyed playing Chopin and other classic works on the piano;] and who engaged in commenting on the moral, political and sexual questions of the day.<ref>''Andr\u00e9 Gide: A Life in the Present'' by Alan Sheridan.

For a long time after Mohammed had left me, I remained in a state of passionate jubilation, and though I had already achieved pleasure five times with him, I renewed my ecstasy again and again, and when I got back to my room in the hotel, I prolonged its echoes until morning.<ref name=\"If It Die: An Autobiography\">{{cite book|last1=Gide|first1=Andre|title=If It Die: An Autobiography|date=1935|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0375726064|pages=288|edition=New|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0-TBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT3&lpg=PT3&dq=Gide+A.+(1935).+If+It+Die:+An+Autobiography.+New+York:+Random+House.&source=bl&ots=wes84N18c0&sig=M05-UdunvRRRpVl4riFXdxC0ujU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig8rP_lK7MAhWFVyYKHVTtDZQQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&q=Gide%20A.%20(1935).%20If%20It%20Die%3A%20An%20Autobiography.%20New%20York%3A%20Random%20House.&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nGide's novel ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'', which he considered his most important work, erects a defense of pederasty.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{main|Bibliography of Andr\u00e9 Gide}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonialism]]\n* [[LGBT culture in Paris]]\n* ''[[Mise en abyme]]''\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* [[Alan Sheridan]], ''Andr\u00e9 Gide: A Life in the Present.''

A key difficulty in the design of good [[algorithm]]s for this problem is that formulas for the [[variance]] may involve sums of squares, which can lead to [[numerical instability]] as well as to [[arithmetic overflow]] when dealing with large values.\n\n==Na\u00efve algorithm==\nA formula for calculating the variance of an entire [[statistical population|population]] of size ''N'' is:\n\n:<math>\\sigma^2 = \\bar{(x^2)} - \\bar x^2 = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i)^2/N}{N}. \\!</math>\n\nUsing [[Bessel's correction]] to calculate an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] estimate of the population variance from a finite [[statistical sample|sample]] of ''n'' observations, the formula is:\n\n:<math>s^2 = \\displaystyle {\\left(\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} n - \\left( \\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} n \\right)^2\\right)} \\cdot \\frac {n}{n-1}. \\!</math>\n\nTherefore, a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 35px; width: 600px\">\n{{framebox|blue}}\n* Let {{math|''n'' \u2190 0, Sum \u2190 0, SumSq \u2190 0}}\n* For each datum {{mvar|x}}:\n** {{math|''n'' \u2190 ''n'' + 1}}\n** {{math|Sum \u2190 Sum + ''x''}}\n** {{math|SumSq \u2190 SumSq + ''x'' \u00d7 ''x''}}\n* {{math|Var {{=}} (SumSq \u2212 (Sum \u00d7 Sum) / n) / (n \u2212 1)}}\n{{frame-footer}}\n</div>\n\nThis algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by ''N'' instead of ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 on the last line.\n\nBecause {{math|SumSq}} and {{math|(Sum\u00d7Sum)/''n''}} can be very similar numbers, [[Loss of significance|cancellation]] can lead to the [[precision (arithmetic)|precision]] of the result to be much less than the inherent precision of the [[floating-point arithmetic]] used to perform the computation.

However, the algorithm can be improved by adopting the method of the [[assumed mean]].\n\n===Computing shifted data===\n\nWe can use a property of the variance to avoid the catastrophic cancellation in this formula,\nnamely the variance is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] with respect to changes in a [[location parameter]]\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X-K)=\\operatorname{Var}(X).</math>\n\nwith <math>K</math> any constant, which leads to the new formula\n\n:<math>s^2 = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-K)^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-K))^2/n}{n-1}. \\!</math>\n\nthe closer <math>K</math> is to the mean value the more accurate the result will be, but just choosing a value inside the\nsamples range will guarantee the desired stability. If the values <math>(x_i - K)</math> are small then there are no problems with the sum of its squares, on the contrary, if they are large it necessarily means that the variance is large as well. In any case the second term in the formula is always smaller than the first one therefore no cancellation may occur.<ref name=\"Chan1983\" />\n\nIf we take just the first sample as <math>K</math> the algorithm can be written in [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] as\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef shifted_data_variance(data):\n   if len(data) < 2:\n      return 0.0\n   K = data[0]\n   n = Ex = Ex2 = 0.0\n   for x in data:\n      n = n + 1\n      Ex += x - K\n      Ex2 += (x - K) * (x - K)\n   variance = (Ex2 - (Ex * Ex)/n)/(n - 1)\n   # use n instead of (n-1) if want to compute the exact variance of the given data\n   # use (n-1) if data are samples of a larger population\n   return variance\n</source>\nthis formula facilitates as well the incremental computation, that can be expressed as\n<source lang=\"python\">\nK = n = Ex = Ex2 = 0.0\n\ndef add_variable(x):\n    if (n == 0):\n      K = x\n    n = n + 1\n    Ex += x - K\n    Ex2 += (x - K) * (x - K)\n\ndef remove_variable(x):\n    n = n - 1\n    Ex -= (x - K)\n    Ex2 -= (x - K) * (x - K)\n\ndef get_meanvalue():\n    return K + Ex / n\n\ndef get_variance():\n    return (Ex2 - (Ex*Ex)/n) / (n-1)\n</source>\n\n==Two-pass algorithm==\nAn alternative approach, using a different formula for the variance, first computes the sample mean,\n:<math>\\bar x = \\displaystyle \\frac {\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}{n}</math>,\nand then computes the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean,\n:<math>\\mathrm{variance} = s^2 = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}{n-1} \\!</math>,\nwhere s is the standard deviation.  This is given by the following pseudocode:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef two_pass_variance(data):\n    n = sum1 = sum2 = 0\n\n    for x in data:\n        n += 1\n        sum1 += x\n\n    mean = sum1 / n\n\n    for x in data:\n        sum2 += (x - mean)*(x - mean)\n\n    variance = sum2 / (n - 1)\n    return variance\n</source>\n\nThis algorithm is numerically stable if ''n'' is small.<ref name=\"Einarsson2005\"/><ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas | last=Higham |title=Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms (2 ed) (Problem 1.10)| publisher=SIAM|year=2002}}</ref> However, the results of both of these simple algorithms (\"Na\u00efve\" and \"Two-pass\") can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums. Techniques such as [[compensated summation]] can be used to combat this error to a degree.\n\n==Welford's Online algorithm==\nIt is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass, inspecting each value <math>x_i</math> only once; for example, when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values, or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation.  For such an [[online algorithm]], a [[recurrence relation]] is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion.\n\nThe following formulas can be used to update the [[mean]] and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>. Here, {{overline|''x''}}<sub>''n''</sub> denotes the sample mean of the first ''n'' samples (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''), ''s''<sup>2</sup><sub>''n''</sub> their sample variance, and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup><sub>''n''</sub> their population variance.\n\n:<math>\\bar x_n = \\frac{(n-1) \\, \\bar x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \\bar x_{n-1} + \\frac{x_n - \\bar x_{n-1}}{n} \\!</math>\n\n:<math>s^2_n = \\frac{(n-2)}{(n-1)} \\, s^2_{n-1} + \\frac{(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})^2}{n} = s^2_{n-1} + \\frac{(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})^2}{n} - \\frac{s^2_{n-1}}{(n-1)}, \\quad n>1 </math>\n\n:<math>\\sigma^2_n = \\frac{(n-1) \\, \\sigma^2_{n-1} + (x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(x_n - \\bar x_{n})}{n} = \\sigma^2_{n-1} + \\frac{(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(x_n - \\bar x_{n}) - \\sigma^2_{n-1}}{n}.</math>\n\nThese formulas suffer from numerical instability, as they repeatedly subtract a small number from a big number which scales with ''n''. A better quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the current mean, <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x_n)^2</math>, here denoted <math>M_{2,n}</math>:\n\n:<math>M_{2,n}\\! = M_{2,n-1} + (x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(x_n - \\bar x_n)</math>\n:<math>s^2_n = \\frac{M_{2,n}}{n-1}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma^2_n = \\frac{M_{2,n}}{n}</math>\n\nThis algorithm was found by Welford,<ref>B.

Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30.  Both the na\u00efve algorithm and two-pass algorithm compute these values correctly.\n\nNext consider the sample ({{nowrap|10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;4}}, {{nowrap|10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;7}}, {{nowrap|10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;13}}, {{nowrap|10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;16}}), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample.  The two-pass algorithm computes this variance estimate correctly, but the na\u00efve algorithm returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30.\n\nWhile this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of the na\u00efve algorithm, further increasing the offset makes the error catastrophic.

The first approach is to compute the statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resulting histogram, which effectively becomes a [[one-pass algorithm]] for higher moments. One benefit is that the statistical moment calculations can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy such that the computations can be tuned to the precision of, e.g., the data storage format or the original measurement hardware.  A relative histogram of a random variable can be constructed in\nthe conventional way: the range of potential values is\ndivided into bins and the number of occurrences within each bin are\ncounted and plotted such that the area of each rectangle equals\nthe portion of the sample values within that bin:\n\n: <math> H(x_k)=\\frac{h(x_k)}{A}</math>\n\nwhere <math>h(x_k)</math> and <math>H(x_k)</math> represent the frequency and\nthe relative frequency at bin <math>x_k</math> and <math>A= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} h(x_k)\n\\,\\Delta x_k</math> is the total area of the histogram. After this\nnormalization, the <math>n</math> raw moments and central moments of <math>x(t)</math>\ncan be calculated from the relative histogram:\n\n: <math>\n m_n^{(h)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \\, H(x_k) \\Delta x_k\n            = \\frac{1}{A} \\sum_{k=1}^{K}  x_k^n \\, h(x_k) \\Delta x_k\n</math>\n\n: <math>\n \\theta_n^{(h)}= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\\Big)^n \\, H(x_k)\\Delta x_k\n               = \\frac{1}{A} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\\Big)^n \\, h(x_k) \\Delta x_k\n</math>\n\nwhere the superscript <math>^{(h)}</math> indicates the moments are\ncalculated from the histogram. For constant bin width <math>\\Delta\nx_k=\\Delta x</math> these two expressions can be simplified using <math>I= A/\\Delta x</math>:\n\n: <math>\n m_n^{(h)}= \\frac{1}{I} {\\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_k^n \\, h(x_k)}\n</math>\n\n: <math>\n \\theta_n^{(h)}= \\frac{1}{I}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Big(x_k-m_1^{(h)}\\Big)^n \\, h(x_k)}\n</math>\n\nThe second approach from Choi and Sweetman\n<ref name=\"Choi2010\" />\nis an analytical methodology to combine statistical moments from individual segments of a time-history such that the resulting overall moments are those of the complete time-history. This methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments, or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times.\n\nIf <math>Q</math> sets of statistical moments are known:\n<math>(\\gamma_{0,q},\\mu_{q},\\sigma^2_{q},\\alpha_{3,q},\\alpha_{4,q})\n\\quad </math> for <math>q=1,2,\\ldots,Q </math>, then each <math>\\gamma_n</math> can\nbe expressed in terms of the equivalent <math>n</math> raw moments:\n\n: <math>\n\\gamma_{n,q}= m_{n,q} \\gamma_{0,q} \\qquad \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad n=1,2,3,4  \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad q = 1,2, \\dots ,Q\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma_{0,q}</math> is generally taken to be the duration of the <math>q^{th}</math> time-history, or the number of points if <math>\\Delta t</math> is constant.\n\nThe benefit of expressing the statistical moments in terms of <math>\\gamma</math> is that the <math>Q</math> sets can be combined by addition, and there is no upper limit on the value of <math>Q</math>.\n\n: <math>\n \\gamma_{n,c}= \\sum_{q=1}^Q \\gamma_{n,q} \\quad \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad n=0,1,2,3,4\n</math>\n\nwhere the subscript <math>_c</math> represents the concatenated time-history or combined <math>\\gamma</math>. These combined values of <math>\\gamma</math> can then be inversely transformed into raw moments representing the complete concatenated time-history\n\n: <math>\n m_{n,c}=\\frac{\\gamma_{n,c}}{\\gamma_{0,c}} \\quad \\textrm{for} \\quad n=1,2,3,4\n</math>\n\nKnown relationships between the raw moments (<math>m_n</math>) and the central moments  (<math> \\theta_n = E[(x-\\mu)^n])</math>)\nare then used to compute the central moments of the concatenated time-history.  Finally, the statistical moments of the concatenated history are computed from the central moments:\n\n: <math>\n \\mu_c=m_{1,c}\n \\qquad \\sigma^2_c=\\theta_{2,c}\n \\qquad \\alpha_{3,c}=\\frac{\\theta_{3,c}}{\\sigma_c^3}\n \\qquad \\alpha_{4,c}={\\frac{\\theta_{4,c}}{\\sigma_c^4}}-3\n</math>\n\n==Covariance==\nVery similar algorithms can be used to compute the [[covariance]].  \n\n===Na\u00efve algorithm===\nThe na\u00efve algorithm is:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i)/n}{n}. \\!</math>\n\nFor the algorithm above, one could use the following Python code:\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef naive_covariance(data1, data2):\n    n = len(data1)\n    sum12 = 0\n    sum1 = sum(data1)\n    sum2 = sum(data2)\n\n    for i1, i2 in zip(data1, data2):\n        sum12 += i1*i2\n\n    covariance = (sum12 - sum1*sum2 / n) / n\n    return covariance\n</source>\n\n===With estimate of the mean===\nAs for the variance, the covariance of two random variables is also shift-invariant, so given any two constant values <math>k_x</math> and <math>k_y,</math> it can be written:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\operatorname{Cov}(X-k_x,Y-k_y) = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-k_x) (y_i-k_y) - (\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-k_x))(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-k_y))/n}{n}. \\!</math>\n\nand again choosing a value inside the range of values will stabilize the formula against catastrophic cancellation as well as make it more robust against big sums. Taking the first value of each data set, the algorithm can be written as:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef shifted_data_covariance(dataX, dataY):\n   n = len(dataX)\n   if (n < 2):\n     return 0\n   kx = dataX[0]\n   ky = dataY[0]\n   Ex = Ey = Exy = 0\n   for ix, iy in zip(dataX, dataY):\n      Ex += ix - kx\n      Ey += iy - ky\n      Exy += (ix - kx) * (iy - ky)\n   return (Exy - Ex * Ey / n) / n\n</source>\n\n===Two-pass===\nThe two-pass algorithm first computes the sample means, and then the covariance:\n:<math>\\bar x = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n</math>\n:<math>\\bar y = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i/n</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\displaystyle\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y)}{n}. \\!</math>\n\nThe two-pass algorithm may be written as:\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef two_pass_covariance(data1, data2):\n    n = len(data1)\n\n    mean1 = sum(data1) / n\n    mean2 = sum(data2) / n\n\n    covariance = 0\n\n    for i1, i2 in zip(data1, data2):\n        a = i1 - mean1\n        b = i2 - mean2\n        covariance += a*b / n\n    return covariance\n</source>\n\nA slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals.  The final sums <math>\\textstyle\\sum x_i</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\sum y_i</math> ''should'' be zero, but the second pass compensates for any small error.\n\n===Online===\n\nA stable one-pass algorithm exists, similar to the online algorithm for computing the variance, that computes co-moment <math>\\textstyle C_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x_n)(y_i - \\bar y_n)</math>:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n\\bar x_n &= \\bar x_{n-1} &\\,+\\,& \\frac{x_n - \\bar x_{n-1}}{n} \\\\\n\\bar y_n &= \\bar y_{n-1} &\\,+\\,& \\frac{y_n - \\bar y_{n-1}}{n} \\\\\nC_n      &= C_{n-1}      &\\,+\\,& (x_n - \\bar x_n)(y_n - \\bar y_{n-1}) \\\\\n         &= C_{n-1}      &\\,+\\,& (x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(y_n - \\bar y_n) \\\\\n\\end{alignat}</math>\nThe apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that <math>\\textstyle (x_n - \\bar x_n) = \\frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})</math>, so both update terms are equal to <math>\\textstyle \\frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(y_n - \\bar y_{n-1})</math>.  Even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means, then using the stable one-pass algorithm on the residuals.\n\nThus we can compute the covariance as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Cov}_N(X,Y) = \\frac{C_N}{N} &= \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)\\cdot(N-1) + (x_n - \\bar x_n)(y_n - \\bar y_{n-1})}{N}\\\\\n   &= \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)\\cdot(N-1) + (y_n - \\bar y_n)(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})}{N}\\\\\n   &= \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)\\cdot(N-1) + \\frac{N-1}{N}(x_n - \\bar x_{n-1})(y_n - \\bar y_{n-1})}{N}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef online_covariance(data1, data2):\n    meanx = meany = C = n = 0\n    for x, y in zip(data1, data2):\n        n += 1\n        dx = x - meanx\n        meanx += dx / n\n        meany += (y - meany) / n\n        C += dx * (y - meany)\n\n    population_covar = C / n\n    # Bessel's correction for sample variance\n    sample_covar = C / (n - 1)\n</source>\n\nWe can also make a small modification to compute the weighted covariance:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef online_weighted_covariance(data1, data2, data3):\n    meanx = meany = 0\n    wsum = wsum2 = 0\n    C = 0\n    for x, y, w in zip(data1, data2, data3):\n        wsum += w\n        wsum2 += w*w\n        dx = x - meanx\n        meanx += (w / wsum) * dx\n        meany += (w / wsum) * (y - meany)\n        C += w * dx * (y - meany)\n\n    population_covar = C / wsum\n    # Bessel's correction for sample variance\n    # Frequency weights\n    sample_frequency_covar = C / (wsum - 1)\n    # Reliability weights\n    sample_reliability_covar = C / (wsum - wsum2 / wsum)\n</source>\n\nLikewise, there is a formula for combining the covariances of two sets that can be used to parallelize the computation:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n:<math>C_X = C_A + C_B + (\\bar x_A - \\bar x_B)(\\bar y_A - \\bar y_B)\\cdot\\frac{n_A n_B}{n_X}. </math>\n\n===Weighted batched version===\n\nA version of the weighted online algorithm that does batched updated also exists : let\n<math>w_1, \\dots w_N</math> denote the weights, we can write\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n\\bar x_{n+k} &= \\bar x_n &\\,+\\,& \\frac{\\sum_{i=n+1}^{n+k} w_i (x_i - \\bar x_n)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n+k} w_i} \\\\\n\\bar y_{n+k} &= \\bar y_n &\\,+\\,& \\frac{\\sum_{i=n+1}^{n+k} w_i (y_i - \\bar y_n)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n+k} w_i} \\\\\nC_{n+k}      &= C_n      &\\,+\\,& \\sum_{i=n+1}^{n+k} w_i (x_i - \\bar x_{n+k})(y_i - \\bar y_n) \\\\\n             &= C_n      &\\,+\\,& \\sum_{i=n+1}^{n+k} w_i (x_i - \\bar x_n)(y_i - \\bar y_{n+k}) \\\\\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nThe covariance can then be computed as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cov}_N(X,Y) = \\frac{C_N}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algebraic formula for the variance]]\n*[[Kahan summation algorithm]]\n*[[Squared deviations from the mean]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathWorld|title=Sample Variance Computation|urlname=SampleVarianceComputation}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Algorithms For Calculating Variance}}\n[[Category:Statistical algorithms]]\n[[Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion]]\n[[Category:Articles with example pseudocode]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Python code]]", "sha1": "3h01oza87u7dxr94vq7cvbu0gr94bgl"}}, {"title": "Almond", "ns": "0", "id": "1064", "revision": {"id": "865958915", "parentid": "865958902", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T09:04:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Larry Hockett", "id": "15977090"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/2401:7400:4001:2BEE:C883:F6A8:9437:5D67|2401:7400:4001:2BEE:C883:F6A8:9437:5D67]] ([[User talk:2401:7400:4001:2BEE:C883:F6A8:9437:5D67|talk]]) to last version by Dawn Bard", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{speciesbox\n | image = Prunus dulcis - K\u00f6hler\u2013s Medizinal-Pflanzen-250.jpg\n | image_caption = 1897 illustration<ref>illustration from Franz Eugen K\u00f6hler, K\u00f6hler's Medizinal-Pflanzen, 1897</ref>\n | image_alt = Botanical illustration\n | image2 = Ametllesjuliol.jpg\n | image2_caption = Almond tree with ripening fruit.

Within the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell ([[Fruit anatomy#Endocarp|endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.\n\nThe fruit of the almond is a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]], inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanched]] almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the [[seed]]coat, which is then removed to reveal the white [[embryo]].\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Tree ===\nThe almond is a [[deciduous]] tree, growing {{convert|4|-|10|m|0|abbr=on}} in height, with a trunk of up to {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour. Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into [[almond butter]] or [[almond milk]]. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\n\nAlong with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly ''[[muesli]]'' or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including ''[[jesuite]]s''), cookies (including [[macaron|French'' macarons'']], [[macaroon]]s), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), ''[[noghl]]'', and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.\n\n[[Almond cookie]]s, Chinese [[almond biscuit]]s, and Italian ''[[ricciarelli]]'' are made with almonds.\n\n*In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (\u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.\n*In [[Hejaz]], a region of [[Saudi Arabia]], ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee ''Gahwat Al-l\u014dz'' (\u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0632).\n*In Iran, green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called ''chaqale b\u00e2dam''. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named ''harire badam''. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year ([[Nowruz]]) parties.\n*In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for ''[[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries & Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173724/http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|archivedate=12 May 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vicenzi Amaretto s'Italia (Macaroona)|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|accessdate=10 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713181311/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10\u201320%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in ''[[torrone]]''. In [[Apulia]] and [[Sicily]], ''pasta di mandorle'' (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistachio]], or chocolate. In Sicily, [[almond milk]] is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.\n*In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other [[List of Moroccan dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet ''[[tajine]]s'' such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of [[Essaouira]] and Souss are also known for ''amlou'', a spread made of almond paste, [[argan oil]], and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make ''sellou'' (also called ''zamita'' in [[Meknes]] or ''slilou'' in [[Marrakech]]), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.\n*In [[Indian cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of ''[[pasanda]]''-style and [[Mughlai]] [[curry|curries]]. ''Badam halva'' is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or ''sherbet-e-badaam'', is a popular summer drink.

In the Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with [[Book of Genesis]] 43:11, where it is described as \"among the best of fruits\". In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], \"Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers\"  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33\u201334; 37:19\u201320).\n\nSimilarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings and [[icon]]s often include [[mandorla|almond-shaped haloes]] encircling the [[Christ Child]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]].

A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (seventeen-member body appointed by the Governor General) and the House of Representatives (seventeen seats; members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year terms).\n\nAntigua and Barbuda has a long history of free elections, three of which have resulted in peaceful changes of government. Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), for a long time was dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 June 2014. The [[Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party|Antigua Labour Party]] government was elected with fourteen seats. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] has three seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nConstitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on [[English law#Common law|English common law]].\n\n==Executive branch==\nAs head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.\n\n{{Office-table}}\n|[[Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda|Monarch]]\n|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n|\n|6 February 1952\n|-\n|[[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]]\n|[[Rodney Williams (politician)|Rodney Williams]]\n|\n|14 August 2014\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Gaston Browne]]\n|[[Antigua Labour Party|Labour Party]]\n|13 June 2014\n|}\n\n==Legislative branch==\n[[File:Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda.JPG|250px|thumbnail|left|The parliament building in St. John's.]]\nAntigua and Barbuda elects on national level a legislature.

The prime minister and the cabinet are responsible to the Parliament. Elections must be held at least every five years but may be called by the prime minister at any time.\n\nThere are special legislative provisions to account for [[Barbuda]]'s low population relative to that of [[Antigua]]. Barbuda is guaranteed one member of the House of Representatives and two members of the Senate. In addition, there is a [[Barbuda Council]] to govern the internal affairs of the island.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Elect|List of political parties in Antigua and Barbuda|Elections in Antigua and Barbuda}}\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n6 parishes and 2 dependencies*; Barbuda*, Redonda*, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Mary, Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Saint Philip\n\n==Judicial branch==\nAntigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]].

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture.

In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism....

The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly \"German\" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:<ref name=bismarck />\n\n<blockquote>According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.<ref name=bismarck /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.<ref name=bismarck />\n \nAntisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in \"The Good Bargain\" (\"''Der gute Handel\"'') and \"The Jew Among Thorns\" (''\"Der Jude im Dorn\"'').\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence.

[[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him.

In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco.

In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.\nTunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.\nIn 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a bomb in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Iran====\n{{See also|Holocaust denial in Iran}}\n[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.\n\nIn July, the winner of Iran's first annual International [[Wall Street]] Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet [[Fars News]], was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the [[New York Stock Exchange]], which is made to look like the [[Western Wall]].

He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941.

He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Pakistan|Antisemitism in Pakistan}}\nThe U.S. State Department's first Report on Global Anti-Semitism mentioned a strong feeling of antisemitism in [[Pakistan]].<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/010505State_A-S.shtml Global Antisemitism Report \u2013 01.05.2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193654/http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/010505State_A-S.shtml |date=5 February 2012 }} Accessed 8 October 2006</ref> In Pakistan, a country without Jewish communities, antisemitic sentiment fanned by antisemitic articles in the press is widespread.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm Report on Global Anti-Semitism] Accessed 8 October 2006</ref>\n\nIn Pakistan, Jews are often regarded as miserly.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005\\10\\21\\story_21-10-2005_pg3_2 Why are the Jews 'kanjoos'? \u2014Khaled Ahmed's Review of the Urdu press], ''Daily Times'' (Pakistan)</ref> After Israel's independence in 1948, violent incidents occurred against Pakistan's small Jewish community of about 2,000 [[Bene Israel]] Jews.

The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].\nJews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. \nAccording to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the \"ADL Global 100\", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that \"Jews have too much power in the business world\".<ref>{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref>\nIn March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published.

One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the \"Jewish banker class\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}\n\nThe ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well.

Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the [[Caspian Sea]], whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. About the size of [[Portugal]] or the state of [[Maine]], Azerbaijan has a total land area of approximately 86,600 square kilometers, less than 0.5% of the land area of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Of the three Transcaucasian states, Azerbaijan has the greatest land area. Special administrative subdivisions are the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]], which is separated from the rest of Azerbaijan by a strip of [[Armenia]]n territory, and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region]], entirely within Azerbaijan. (The status of Nagorno-Karabakh was under negotiation in 1994.) Located in the region of the southern Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea to the east, Georgia and Russia to the north, Iran to the south, and Armenia to the southwest and west. A small part of Nakhchivan also borders Turkey to the northwest. The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbor on the Caspian Sea and has long been the center of the republic's oil industry.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/aj.html|title=CIA Site Redirect \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2096.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref> \n\n==Topography and drainage==\n[[File:Azerbaijan topographic map-de.svg|thumb|300px|right|Topographic map of Azerbaijan]]\nThe elevation changes over a relatively short distance from lowlands to highlands; nearly half the country is considered mountainous. Notable physical features are the gently undulating hills of the subtropical southeastern coast, which are covered with tea plantations, orange groves, and lemon groves; numerous mud volcanoes and mineral springs in the ravines of [[Kobustan Mountain]] near Baku; and coastal terrain that lies as much as twenty-eight meters below sea level.\n\nExcept for its eastern Caspian shoreline and some areas bordering Georgia and Iran, Azerbaijan is ringed by mountains. To the northeast, bordering Russia's Dagestan Autonomous Republic, is the [[Greater Caucasus]] range; to the west, bordering Armenia, is the [[Lesser Caucasus]] range. To the extreme southeast, the [[Talysh Mountains]] form part of the border with Iran. The highest elevations occur in the Greater Caucasus, where [[Bazard\u00fcz\u00fc|Mount Bazar-dyuzi]] rises 4,466 meters above sea level. Eight large rivers flow down from the Caucasus ranges into the central [[Kura-Aras Lowlands]], alluvial flatlands and low delta areas along the seacoast designated by the Azerbaijani name for the [[Mtkvari River]] (Kura) and its main tributary, the Aras. The Mtkvari, the longest river in the Caucasus region, forms the delta and drains into the Caspian a short distance downstream from the confluence with the Aras. The [[Mingechaur Reservoir]], with an area of 605 square kilometers that makes it the largest body of water in Azerbaijan, was formed by damming the Kura in western Azerbaijan. The waters of the reservoir provide hydroelectric power and irrigation of the Kura-Aras plain. Most of the country's rivers are not navigable. About 15% of the land in Azerbaijan is arable.\n\n{{Location map+ |Azerbaijan |width=300 |float=right |caption=Map of Azerbaijan |places=\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.39528 |long=49.88223 |label=Baku }}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.68278 |long=46.36056 |label=Ganja  |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.58972|long=49.66861 |label=Sumqayit  |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.77000|long=47.04889 |label=Mingachevir  |position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.39667|long=49.97361 |label=Qara\u00e7uxur|position=bottom }}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=39.93194|long=48.92028 |label=Shirvan }}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=39.20889|long=45.41222 |label=Nakhchivan&nbsp;City |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.42167|long=49.96444 |label=Bak\u0131xanov|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=41.19194|long=47.17056 |label=Shaki }}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=40.61722|long=47.15000 |label=Yevlakh }}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=39.81528|long=46.75194 |label=Khankedi  |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Azerbaijan |lat=38.75361|long=48.85111 |label=Lankaran }}\n}}\n\n==Mountains==\nAzerbaijan is nearly surrounded by mountains.

The country\u2019s highest peak, [[Bazard\u00fcz\u00fc|Bazardyuze Dagi]], rises to 4,485 m in this range near the Azerbaijan-Russia border. The [[Lesser Caucasus]] range, with elevations up to 3,500 m, lies to the west along the border with Armenia.

Major sources of pollution include oil refineries and chemical and metallurgical industries, which in the early 1990s continued to operate as inefficiently as they had in the Soviet era. Air quality is extremely poor in Baku, the center of oil refining. Some reports have described Baku's air as the most polluted in the former Soviet Union, and other industrial centers suffer similar problems.\n\nThe Caspian Sea, including Baku Bay, has been polluted by oil leakages and the dumping of raw or inadequately treated sewage, reducing the yield of caviar and fish. In the Soviet period, Azerbaijan was pressed to use extremely heavy applications of pesticides to improve its output of scarce subtropical crops for the rest of the Soviet Union. The continued regular use of the pesticide DDT in the 1970s and 1980s was an egregious lapse, although that chemical was officially banned in the Soviet Union because of its toxicity to humans. Excessive application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers has caused extensive [[groundwater pollution]] and has been linked by Azerbaijani scientists to birth defects and illnesses. Rising water levels in the Caspian Sea, mainly caused by natural factors exacerbated by man-made structures, have reversed the decades-long drying trend and now threaten coastal areas; the average level rose 1.5 meters between 1978 and 1993. Because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, large numbers of trees were felled, roads were built through pristine areas, and large expanses of agricultural land were occupied by military forces.\n\nLike other former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan faces a gigantic environmental cleanup complicated by the economic uncertainties left in the wake of the Moscow-centered planning system. The Committee for the Protection of the Natural Environment is part of the Azerbaijani government, but in the early 1990s it was ineffective at targeting critical applications of limited funds, establishing pollution standards, or monitoring compliance with environmental regulations. Early in 1994, plans called for Azerbaijan to participate in the international Caspian Sea Forum, sponsored by the European Union (EU).\n\n; [[Natural hazard]]s:\n: Droughts and floods; some lowland areas threatened by rising levels of the Caspian Sea\n; [[Natural environment|Environment]]\u2014current issues:\n: Local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baky and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil pollution results from the use of [[DDT]] as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants used in the production of [[Cotton production in Azerbaijan|cotton]].\n; Environment - international agreements:\n:* Party to: [[Air Pollution]], [[Biodiversity]], Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n:* Signed, but not ratified: none\n\n==Area and boundaries==\n; Area:\n:* Total: 86,600 km\u00b2 - ''country comparison to the world:'' 113\n:* Land: 82,629 km\u00b2\n:* Water: 3,971 km\u00b2\n:* Note: Includes the exclave of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region; the region's autonomy was abolished by Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on November 26, 1991.\n\n; Area comparative\n:* Australia comparative: larger than [[Tasmania]]\n:* Canada comparative: larger than [[New Brunswick]]\n:* United Kingdom comparative: slightly larger than [[Scotland]]\n:* United States comparative: slightly smaller than [[Maine]]\n:* [[European Union|EU]] comparative: slightly smaller than [[Portugal]]\n; Land [[Border|boundaries]]:\n:* Total: 2,468 km\n:* Border countries: [[Armenia]] (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia (with Azerbaijan-Nakhchivan exclave) 221 km, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] 428 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, [[Iran]] (with Azerbaijan-Nakhchivan exclave) 700 km, Russia 338 km, [[Turkey]] 17 km\n; [[Coastline]]:\n: 0 km (landlocked).

The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|1918\u201320 (Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988\u201394 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] declared, \"Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality,\" and \"in 1918, [[Yerevan]] was granted to the [[Armenians]]. It was a great mistake. The [[Erivan khanate|khanate of Iravan]] was the [[Azeris|Azeri]] territory, the Armenians were guests here.\"<ref>[http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612043901/http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |date=12 June 2009 }}, ''[[REGNUM News Agency]]'', 17 January 2008</ref>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with mutual massacres in Azerbaijan and Armenia resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions, which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire, which has since been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe two countries are still technically at war.

In 2004, Azerbaijan threatened to formally recognize the TRNC if the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] was voted down by the Greek Cypriots (who rejected the plan in one of twin referendums held 24 April 2004 in both the Greek and Turkish zones simultaneously), but backed off the threat when it was pointed out by Cyprus that doing so would be hypocritical, as a portion of its territory just like that of Cyprus itself is under occupation and would probably result in negative impact on its ongoing dispute with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref>[http://www.turkishpolicy.com/images/stories/2005-04-neighbors/TPQ2005-4-ismailzade.pdf Turkey and Azerbaijan: The Honeymoon is Over] by Fariz Ismailzade.

This led to [[Sumgait pogrom|anti-Armenian rioting]] in Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani militias beginning their effort to expel Armenians from the enclave. In 1992 a war broke out and [[pogrom]]s of Armenians and Azeris forced both groups to flee their homes. In 1994, a Russian-brokered ceasefire ended the war but more than 1 million ethnic Armenians and Azeris are still not able to return home.

The climate is highland continental: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,095 m above sea-level at [[Mount Aragats]].\n\nPollution from toxic chemicals such as [[DDT]] is not helping the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country.\n\nArmenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and [[water pollution]] and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternative energy sources are identified.\n\n'''[[Geographic coordinates]]''': {{Coord|40|00|N|45|00|E|type:country}}\n\n==Physical environment==\n[[Image:Armenia 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Detailed map of Armenia]] \nArmenia is located in southern Transcaucasia, the region southwest of [[Russia]] between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Modern [[Armenia]] occupies part of historical Armenia, whose ancient centres were in the valley of the [[Araks River]] and the region around [[Lake Van]] in Turkey. Armenia is bordered on the north by Georgia, on the east by [[Azerbaijan]], on the southwest by the [[Nagorno-Karabagh]], on the south by Iran, and on the west by Turkey.\n\n==Topography and drainage==\n[[Image:Armenia Topography.png|thumb|left|Topography of Armenia]]\nTwenty-five million years ago, a geological upheaval pushed up the Earth's crust to form the Armenian Plateau, creating the complex topography of modern Armenia. The Lesser Caucasus range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between [[Lake Sevan]] and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult. Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes, which have plagued Armenia. In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, Leninakan (now [[Gyumri]]), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people.\n\nAbout half of Armenia's area of approximately {{convert|29,800|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} has an elevation of at least {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and only 3% of the country lies below {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The lowest points are in the valleys of the Araks River and the Debet River in the far north, which have elevations of {{convert|380|and|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between {{convert|2640|and|3280|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. The largest of these, [[Mount Aragats]], {{convert|4095|m|ft|0|sp=us}} high, is also the highest point in Armenia. Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, [[Yerevan]] and Gyumri (which was called Aleksandropol' during the tsarist period), are located.\n\nThe valleys of the Debet and Akstafa rivers form the chief routes into Armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains. Lake Sevan, {{convert|72.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across at its widest point and {{convert|376|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long, is by far the largest lake. It lies {{convert|2070|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level on the plateau. Terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast, which is drained by the Bargushat River, and most moderate in the Araks River valley to the extreme southwest. Most of Armenia is drained by the [[Araks]] or its tributary, the [[Hrazdan]], which flows from Lake Sevan. The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran while the [[Zangezur Mountains]] form the border between Armenia's southern [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]] and Azerbaijan's adjacent Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n[[Image:Armenian terrain.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Armenian terrain]]\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Armenia}}\n\nTemperatures in Armenia generally depend upon elevation. Mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, creating wide seasonal variations with cold snowy winters, and warm to hot summers. On the Armenian Plateau, the mean midwinter temperature is {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|\u221215|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, and the mean midsummer temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year in the lower Araks River valley to {{convert|800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} at the highest altitudes. Despite the harshness of winter in most parts (with frosts reaching {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and lower in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] region), the fertility of the plateau's volcanic soil made Armenia one of the world's earliest sites of agricultural activity.\n\n==Environmental problems==\nA broad public discussion of environmental problems began in the mid-1980s, when the first \"green\" groups formed in opposition to Yerevan's intense industrial air pollution and to nuclear power generation in the wake of the 1986 reactor explosion at Chernobyl'. Environmental issues helped form the basis of the nationalist independence movement when environmental demonstrations subsequently merged with those for other political causes in the late 1980s.\nrepublics as they emerge from the centralized planning system's disastrous approach to resource management. By 1980 the infrequency of sightings of Mount Ararat, which looms about sixty kilometers across the closed Turkish border, became a symbol of worsening air pollution in Yerevan.\n\n==Area and boundaries==\n'''Area''':\n<br>''total:'' 29,743&nbsp;km\u00b2\n:''country comparison to the world:'' 143\n''land:'' 28,203&nbsp;km\u00b2\n<br>''water:'' 1,540&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\n'''Area comparative'''\n*[[Australia]] comparative: about one third (33%) the size of [[Tasmania]]\n*[[Canada]] comparative: greater than half (56%) the size of [[Nova Scotia]]\n*[[Turkey]] comparative: about a quarter (%24) smaller than the size of  [[Konya Province]].\n*[[United Kingdom]] comparative: about one third larger (30%) than [[Wales]]\n*[[United States]] comparative: slightly smaller (7%) than [[Maryland]]\n*[[European Union|EU]] comparative: slightly smaller (8%) than [[Belgium]]\n\n'''Land boundaries''':\n<br>''total:'' 1,570&nbsp;km\n<br>''border countries:''\n[[Azerbaijan]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]-proper 566&nbsp;km, [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Azerbaijan-Nakhchivan]] exclave 221&nbsp;km, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] 219&nbsp;km, [[Iran]] 44&nbsp;km, [[Turkey]] 311&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:'''\n0&nbsp;km (landlocked)\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\nnone (landlocked)\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''\n<br>''lowest point:''\n[[Debed River]] 400 m\n<br>''highest point:''\n[[Mount Aragats]] 4,090 m\n\n'''Extreme points of Armenia:'''\n<br>''North:''\n[[Tavush]] ({{Coord|41|17|N|45|0|E|type:landmark_region:AM}})\n<br>''South:''\n[[Syunik Province|Syunik']] ({{Coord|38|49|N|46|10|E|type:landmark_region:AM}})\n<br>''West:''\n[[Shirak Province|Shirak]] ({{Coord|41|5|N|43|27|E|type:landmark_region:AM}})\n<br>''East:''\nSyunik' ({{Coord|39|13|N|46|37|E|type:landmark_region:AM}})\n\n==Resources and land use==\n'''Natural resources:'''\nsmall deposits of [[gold]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[zinc]], [[bauxite]]\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br>''arable land:''15.8%\n<br>''permanent crops:'' 1.9%\n<br>''permanent pastures: 4.2%''\n<br>''forest: 9.1%''\n<br>''other:'' 31.2% (2011)\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\n2,740&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2012)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n7.77 m\u00b3 (2011) Armenia is considered to be a big water \u201csupplier\u201d in the Caspian basin; as a result, the country lacks water, especially in summer when the rate of evaporation exceeds the amount of precipitation.
