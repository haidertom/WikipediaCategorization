Alston was active in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]; Alston was the first African-American supervisor for the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]]. Alston designed and painted murals at the [[Harlem Hospital]] and the [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building (1928)|Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building]]. In 1990 Alston's bust of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] became the first image of an African American displayed at the [[White House]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Early life===\n\nCharles Henry Alston was born on November 28, 1907, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], to [[Reverend]] Primus Priss Alston and Anna Elizabeth Miller Alston, and was the youngest of five children.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\">{{cite book |last=Wardlaw |first=Alvia J. |author2=|title=Charles Alston |publisher=Pomegranate |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7649-3766-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Hollis\">{{cite web | year=2011 | title=Charles Henry Alston | work=Artists | publisher=Hollis Taggart Galleries | url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/charles-henry-alston | accessdate= April 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Pierce\">{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Lemoine |year=2004 |title=Charles Alston \u2013 An Appreciation |journal=The International Review of African American Art |issue=4 |pages=33\u201338 }}</ref> Only three survived past infancy: Charles, his sister Rousmaniere and his brother Wendell.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Schwartzman\">{{cite book |last=Schwartzman |first=Myron |author2=|title=Romare Bearden: His Life and Art |publisher=[[Abrams Books]] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8109-3108-4}}</ref> His father was born into [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in 1851 in [[Pittsboro, North Carolina]]; after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he graduated from [[St. Augustine's College (North Carolina)|St. Augustine's College]] and became a prominent minister and founder of St. Michael's Episcopal Church.  He was described as a \"race man\": an African American who dedicated his skills to the furtherance of the black race.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> Reverend Alston met his wife when she was a student at his school. Charles was nicknamed \"Spinky\" by his father, and kept the nickname as an adult. In 1910, when Charles was three, his father died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Locals described him in admiration as the \"[[Booker T. Washington]] of Charlotte\".<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\nIn 1913 Anna Alston married Harry Bearden. Through the marriage, the future artist [[Romare Bearden]] became Charles\u2019 cousin. The two Bearden families lived across the street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Schwartzman\"/> As a child Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell's drawings of trains and cars, which the young artist copied.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Interview1\">{{cite AV media |people=Murray, Al (interviewer) |date=October 19, 1968 |title=Oral History Interview with Charles Alston |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-charles-henry-alston-11460 |format=mp3 |medium=  |trans-title=|publisher=Archives of American Art |time= }}</ref> Charles also played with clay, creating a sculpture of [[North Carolina]]. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: \"I\u2019d get buckets of it and put it through strainers and make things out of it. I think that's the first art experience I remember, making things.\"<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/> His mother was a skilled [[embroidery|embroiderer]] and took up painting at the age of 75. His father was also good at drawing, wooing Alston's mother with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\nIn 1915 the family moved to New York, as many African-American families did during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\">{{cite book |last1=Wintz|first1=Cary|last2=Finkelman|first2=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance |publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=1-57958-457-8}}</ref> Alston's step-father, Henry Bearden, left before his wife and children to secure a job overseeing [[elevator]] operations and the [[newsstand]] staff at the [[Bretton Hall, Manhattan|Bretton Hotel]] in the [[Upper West Side]]. The family lived in [[Harlem]] and was considered middle-class. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the people of Harlem suffered economically.  The \"stoic strength\" seen within the community was later expressed in Charles\u2019 fine art.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/> At Public School 179 in [[Manhattan]], the boy's artistic abilities were recognized and he was asked to draw all of the school posters during his years there.<ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\nHarry and Anna Bearden had a dauther, Aida C. Bearden (1917\u20132007) who, on June 9, 1943, in [[Manhattan]], married operatic baritone [[Lawrence Whisonant]].\n\n===Higher education===\n\nAlston graduated from [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was nominated for academic excellence and was the art editor of the school's magazine, ''The Magpie''. He was a member of the [[Arista - National Honor Society]] and also studied drawing and anatomy at the Saturday school of the [[National Academy of Design|National Academy of Art]] .<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> In high school he was given his first [[oil paint]]s and learned about his aunt [[Bessye J. Bearden|Bessye Bearden's]] art salons, which stars like [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Langston Hughes]] attended. After graduating in 1925, he attended [[Columbia University]], turning down a scholarship to the [[Yale School of Fine Arts]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Interview1\"/>\n[[File:\"Sgt.

Both were members of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry Regiment]] stationed in New York City.]]\nAlston entered the pre-architectural program only to lose interest upon seeing the lack of success many African-American architects had in the field. After also experimenting with [[pre-med]], he decided that math, physics and chemistry \"was not just my bag\" and he entered the fine arts program. During his time at Columbia he joined [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], worked on the university's ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' and drew cartoons for the school's magazine ''[[Jester of Columbia|Jester]]''.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> He also hung out in Harlem restaurants and clubs, where his love for jazz and black music would be fostered. In 1929 he graduated and received a fellowship to study at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], where he obtained his Master's in 1931.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\n===Later life===\nFor the years 1942\u201343 Alston was stationed in the army at [[Fort Huachuca]] in [[Arizona]]. Upon returning to New York on April 8, 1944, he married Dr. [[Myra Adele Logan]], then an intern at the [[Harlem Hospital]].  They met when he was working on a [[Charles Alston#Murals|mural project]] at the hospital. Their home, including his studio, as on Edgecombe Avenue near [[Highbridge Park]]. The couple lived close to family; at their frequent gatherings Alston enjoyed cooking and Myra played piano. During the 1940s Alston also took occasional art classes studying under [[Alexander Kostellow]].\n\nIn January 1977 Myra Logan died.  Months later on April 27, 1977, Charles ''Spinky'' Alston died after a long bout with cancer.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> His memorial service was held at St. Martins Episcopal Church on May 21, 1977, in New York City.<ref name=\"Funeral\">Charles Henry Alston Memorial Service.

During this period, Alston began to teach the 10-year-old [[Jacob Lawrence]], whom he strongly influenced.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Sentinel\">{{cite news |title=First publication of the migration series captures A defining moment in American history. |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/369369766 |newspaper=Sentinel |year=1993 |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref> Alston was introduced to [[African art]] by the poet [[Alain Locke]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Interview1\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/> In the late 1920s Alston joined Bearden and other black artists who refused to exhibit in [[William E. Harmon Foundation]] shows, which featured all-black artists in their traveling exhibits.  Alston and his friends thought the exhibits were curated for a white audience, a form of segregation which the men protested.  They did not want to be set aside but exhibited on the same level as art peers of every skin color.<ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\nIn 1938 the [[Rosenwald Fund]] provided money for Alston to travel to the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the [[Farm Security Administration]], gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/> These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed ''Tobacco Farmer'', the portrait of a young black farmer in white [[overalls]] and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, sitting in front of the landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at [[Atlanta University]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nDuring the 1930s and early 1940s, Alston created illustrations for magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and others.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> He also designed album covers for artists such as [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]].<ref name=\"Pierce\"/> Alston became staff artist at the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] and Public Relations in 1940, creating drawings of notable African Americans. These images were used in over 200 [[black newspapers]] across the country by the government to \"foster goodwill with the black citizenry.\"<ref name=\"Wintz\"/><ref name=\"Germany\">{{cite web | title=Charles H.

In 1950, he became the first African-American instructor at the [[Art Students League]], where he remained on faculty until 1971.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/> In 1950, his ''Painting'' was exhibited at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and his artwork was one of few purchased by the museum.<ref name=\"Wintz\"/> He landed his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the [[John Heller Gallery]], which represented artists such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. He exhibited there five times from 1953 to 1958.\n\nIn 1956, he became the first African-American instructor at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], where he taught for a year before going to [[Belgium]] on behalf of MOMA and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].  He coordinated the children's community center at [[Expo 58]]. In 1958 he was awarded a grant from and was elected as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\nIn 1963, Alston co-founded [[Spiral (arts alliance)|Spiral]] with [[Romare Bearden]] and [[Hale Woodruff]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/> Spiral served as a collective of conversation and artistic exploration for a large group of artists who \"addressed how black artists should relate to American society in a time of segregation.\" Artists and arts supporters gathered for Spiral, such as [[Emma Amos (painter)|Emma Amos]], [[Perry Ferguson]] and [[Merton Simpson]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Interview1\"/> \n<ref name=\"Patton\">{{cite book |last=Patton |first=Sharon|author2=|title=African-American Art|publisher=Oxford|year=1998|isbn=0-19-284213-7}}</ref> This group served as the 1960s version of 306. Alston was described as an \"intellectual activist\", and in 1968 he spoke at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] about his activism. In the mid-1960s Spiral created an exhibition of black and white artworks, but the exhibition was never officially sponsored by the group due to inner-group disagreements.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nIn 1968, Alston received a presidential appointment from [[Lyndon Johnson]] to the [[National Council of Culture and the Arts]]. Mayor [[John Lindsay]] appointed him to the [[New York City Art Commission]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Wintz\"/> He was made full professor at [[City College of New York]] in 1973 where he had taught since 1968.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/> In 1975 he was awarded the first Distinguished Alumni Award from Teachers College.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/> The Art Student's League created a 21-year merit scholarship in 1977 under Alston's name to commemorate each year of his tenure.<ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\n===Painting a person and a culture===\n\nAlston shared studio space with [[Henry Bannarn]] at 306 W. 141st Street, which served as an open space for artists, photographers, musicians, writers and the like. Other artists held studio space at 306, such as Jacob Lawrence, [[Addison Bate]] and his brother Leon.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/> During this time Alston founded the [[Harlem Artists Guild]] with Savage and [[Elba Lightfoot]] to work towards equality in [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] art programs in New York. During the early years of 306, Alston focused on mastering [[Portrait painting|portraiture]]. Early works such as ''Portrait of a Man'' (1929) show Alston's detailed and realistic style depicted through [[pastel]]s and charcoals, inspired by the style of [[Winold Reiss]]. In his ''Girl in a Red Dress'' (1934) and ''The Blue Shirt'' (1935), he used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem. ''Blue Shirt'' is thought to be a portrait of [[Jacob Lawrence]]. During this time he also created ''Man Seated with Travel Bag'' (c. 1938\u201340), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged ''Vaudeville'' (c. 1930) and its [[caricature]] style of a man in [[blackface]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nInspired from his trip south, Alston began his \"family series\" in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> Intensity and angularity come through in the faces of the youth in his portraits ''Untitled (Portrait of a Girl)'' and ''Untitled (Portrait of a Boy)''. These works also show the influence that [[African sculpture]] had on his portraiture, with ''Portrait of a Boy'' showing more [[cubist]] features. Later family portraits show Alston's exploration of [[religious symbolism]], color, form and space. His family group portraits are often faceless, which Alston states is the way that white America views blacks. Paintings such as ''Family'' (1955) show a woman seated and a man standing with two children \u2013 the parents seem almost solemn while the children are described as hopeful and with a use of color made famous by [[C\u00e9zanne]]. In ''Family Group'' (c. 1950) Alston's use of gray and [[ochre]] tones brings together the parents and son as if one with geometric patterns connecting them together as if a [[puzzle]]. The simplicity of the look, style and emotion upon the family is reflective and probably inspired by Alston's trip south. His work during this time has been described as being \"characterized by his reductive use of form combined with a sun-hued\". During this time he also started to experiment with [[ink and wash painting]] seen in work such as ''Portrait of a Woman'' (1955) as well as creating portraits to illustrate the music surrounding him in Harlem. ''Blues Singer #4'' shows a female singer on stage with a white flower on her shoulder and a bold red dress, reminiscent of [[Ella Fitzgerald]].<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> ''Girl in a Red Dress'' is thought to be [[Bessie Smith]], for whom he drew many times when she was recording and performing. Jazz was an important influence in Alston's work and social life, representing itself in other works like ''Jazz'' (1950) and ''Harlem at Night''.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nThe 1960s civil rights movement influenced his work heavily with artworks influenced by inequality and race relations in the United States. One of his few religious artworks was created in 1960, ''Christ Head'', with an angular \"[[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]esque\" portrait of [[Jesus Christ]]. Seven years later he created ''You never really meant it, did you, Mr. Charlie?'' which, in a similar style as ''Christ Head'' shows a black man standing against a red sky \"looking as frustrated as any individual can look\", according to Alston.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\n====Modernism====\n\nExperimenting with the use of [[negative space]] and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably [[modernist]] style paintings. ''Woman with Flowers'' (1949) has been described as a tribute to [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] and African art makes another strong appearance in ''Ceremonial'' (1950). Untitled works during the era show his use of color overlay using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still live. ''Symbol'' (1953) relates to [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', which was a favorite work of Alston's.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/> His final work of the 1950s, ''Walking'', was inspired by the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] and has come to represent \"the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality.\"<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite web | author=Sharon J.

I called it ''Walking'' on purpose. It wasn't the militancy that you saw later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation.\"<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"BeardernHistory\">{{cite book |last1=Bearden |first1=Romare|last2=Henderson|first2=Henry|title=A History of African-American Artists: From 1792 to the Present  |publisher=Pantheon |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-394-57016-7}}</ref>\n\n====Black and white====\n\nThe [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s was a major influence on Alston. Considered to be one of his most powerful and impressive periods in the late 1950s he began working in black and white up until the mid-1960s. Some of the works are simple abstracts of black ink on white paper, similar to a [[Rorschach test]]. ''Untitled'' (c. 1960s) shows a [[boxing]] match in great simplicity with an attempt to express the drama of the fight through few brushstrokes. Alston worked with oil-on-[[Masonite]] during this period as well, utilizing [[impasto]], cream and [[ochre]] to create a moody cave-like artwork. ''Black and White #1'' (1959) is one of Alston's more \"monumental\" works. Gray, white and black come together to fight for space on an [[abstract art|abstract]] canvas, in a softer form than the more harsh [[Franz Kline]]. Alston continued to explore the relationship between [[monochromatic]] hues throughout the series which Wardlaw describes as \"some of the most profoundly beautiful works of twentieth-century American art.\"<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\n===Murals===\n\nIn the beginning Charles Alston's mural work was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], the latter who he met when they did mural work in New York.<ref name=\"Pierce\"/> In 1943 Alston was elected to the board of directors of the [[National Society of Mural Painters]]. He created murals for the [[Harlem Hospital Center|Harlem Hospital]], [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company|Golden State Mutual]], [[American Museum of Natural History]], Public School 154, the Bronx Family and Criminal Court and the [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\n====Harlem Hospital Murals====\n[[File:Modern Medicine Alston.jpg|thumb|left|''Modern Medicine'' (1936) at the [[Harlem Hospital]]]]\nOriginally hired as an easel painter, in 1935 Alston became the first African-American supervisor to work for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] (FAP) in New York, which would also serve as his first mural work.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/> At this time he was awarded WPA Project Number 1262 \u2013 an opportunity to oversee a group of artists creating [[mural]]s and to supervise their painting for the Harlem Hospital.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/> The first government commission ever awarded to African-American artists including [[Beauford Delaney]], [[Seabrook Powell]] and [[Vertis Hayes]].<ref name=\"Pierce\"/> He also had the chance to create and paint his own contribution to the collection: ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine''.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Hollis\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/> These paintings were part of a diptych completed in 1936 depicting the history of medicine in the African-American community and [[Beauford Delaney]] served as assistant.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/> When creating the murals Alston was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], who a year earlier had created the [[public art]] piece ''Aspects of Negro Life'' for the [[New York Public Library]], and researched traditional [[African culture]], including [[traditional African medicine]]. ''Magic in Medicine'', which depicts African culture and [[holistic]] healing, is considered one of \"America's first public scenes of Africa\". All of the murals sketches submitted were accepted by the FAP, however, four were denied creation by the hospital superintendent Lawrence T. Dermody and commissioner of hospitals S.S. Goldwater due to the excessive amount of African-American representation in the works.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Wintz\"/><ref name=\"ColumbiaMural\">{{cite web | year=2006 | title=The Controversy | work=Harlem Hospital WPA Murals | publisher=Columbia University | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/iraas/wpa/controversy/index.html | accessdate= April 9, 2010}}</ref> The artists fought the response through letter writing and four years later succeeded in gaining the right to complete the murals.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/> The sketches for ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine'' were exhibited in the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s \"New Horizons in American Art\".<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/>\n\n=====Condition=====\n\nAlston's murals were hung in the Women's Pavilion of the hospital over uncapped [[radiator]]s which caused the paintings to deteriorate from the steam. Plans failed to recap the radiators. In 1959 Alston estimated, in a letter to the [[New York State Department of Public Works|Department of Public Works]], that the conservation would cost $1,500 but the funds were never acquired. In 1968, after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s death, Alston was asked to create another mural for the hospital to be placed in a pavilion named after the assassinated [[civil rights]] leader titled ''Man Emerging from the Darkness of Poverty and Ignorance into the Light of a Better World.'' One year after Alston's death in 1977, a group of artists and historians, including the renowned painter and [[Collage|collagist]] [[Romare Bearden]] and art historian Greta Berman, together with administrators from the hospital, and from the NYC Art Commission, examined the murals, and presented a proposal for their restoration to then-mayor [[Ed Koch]].  The request was approved, and conservator Alan Farancz set to work in 1979, rescuing the murals from further decay. Many years passed, and the murals began to deteriorate again \u2013 especially the Alston works, which continued to suffer effects from the radiators.  In 1991 the [[Municipal Art Society]]'s Adopt-a-Mural program was launched and the Harlem Hospital murals were chosen for further restoration (Greta Berman. Personal experience). A grant from Alston's sister Rousmaniere Wilson and step-sister Aida Bearden Winters assisted in completing a restoration of the works in 1993.<ref name=\"Pierce\"/> In 2005 Harlem Hospital announced a $2&nbsp;million project to [[art conservation|conserve]] Alston's murals and three other pieces in the original commissioned project as part of a $225&nbsp;million hospital expansion.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Pierce\"/>\n\n====Golden State Mutual Murals====\n\nIn the late 1940s Alston became involved in a mural project commissioned by [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company]] which asked the artists to create work involving African-American contributions to the settling of California. Alston worked with [[Hale Woodruff]] on the murals in a large studio space in New York where they utilized ladders to reach the upper parts of the canvas.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/> The artworks, which are considered \"priceless contributions to American narrative art\", consists of two panels: ''Exploration and Colonization'' by Alston and ''Settlement and Development'' by Woodruff. Alston's piece covers the [[post-colonial]] period of 1527 to 1850. Images of [[James Beckwourth]], [[Biddy Mason]], and [[William Leidesdorff]] are portrayed in the well detailed historical mural. While both artists kept in contact with African Americans on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] during its creation, influencing the content and depictions. The murals, which were unveiled in 1949, have been on display in the lobby of the Golden State Mutual Headquarters.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/><ref name=\"Patton\"/> Due to [[Recession|economic downturn]] Golden State was forced to sell their entire art collection to ward off its mounting debts and as of spring 2011 the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] had offered $750,000 to purchase the artworks which led to a controversy regarding the importance of the artworks which have been estimated to be worth at least $5&nbsp;million.

During [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]], chromatin facilitates proper segregation of the [[chromosome]]s in [[anaphase]]; the characteristic shapes of chromosomes visible during this stage are the result of DNA being coiled into highly condensed networks of chromatin.\n\nThe primary protein components of chromatin are [[histone]]s, which bind to DNA and function as \"anchors\" around which the strands are wound. In general, there are three levels of chromatin organization:\n# DNA wraps around histone proteins, forming [[nucleosome]]s and the so-called \"beads on a string\" structure ([[euchromatin]]).\n# Multiple histones wrap into a 30-[[nanometer]] fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form ([[heterochromatin]]).{{efn|Though it has been definitively established to exist ''in vitro'', the 30-[[nanometer]] fibre was not seen in recent X-ray studies of human mitotic chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Jeffrey|title=Human mitotic chromosome structure: what happened to the 30-nm fibre?|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=March 2012|volume=31|pages=1621\u20131623|doi=10.1038/emboj.2012.66|pmid=22415369|issue=7|pmc=3321215}}</ref>}}\n# Higher-level [[DNA supercoiling]] of the 30-nm fiber produces the [[metaphase]] chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis).\n\nMany organisms, however, do not follow this organization scheme. For example, [[spermatozoa]] and [[Bird|avian]] [[red blood cell]]s have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells, and [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoa]] do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes at all. [[Prokaryotic]] cells have entirely different structures for organizing their DNA (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called a [[genophore]] and is localized within the nucleoid region).\n\nThe overall structure of the chromatin network further depends on the stage of the [[cell cycle]]. During [[interphase]], the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to [[RNA polymerase|RNA]] and [[DNA polymerase]]s that [[transcription (biology)|transcribe]] and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the specific [[gene]]s present in the DNA. Regions of DNA containing genes which are actively transcribed (\"turned on\") are less tightly compacted and closely associated with RNA polymerases in a structure known as [[euchromatin]], while regions containing inactive genes (\"turned off\") are generally more condensed and associated with structural proteins in [[heterochromatin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chromatin.net/|title=Chromatin Network Home Page.|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Dame, R.T.\n|title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin\n|journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]]\n|volume=56\n|issue=4\n|pages=858\u2013870\n|date=May 2005\n|pmid=15853876\n|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04598.x}}\n</ref> [[Epigenetic]] modification of the structural proteins in chromatin via [[methylation]] and [[acetylation]] also alters local chromatin structure and therefore gene expression. The structure of chromatin networks is currently poorly understood and remains an active area of research in [[molecular biology]].\n\n==Dynamic chromatin structure and hierarchy==\n\nChromatin undergoes various structural changes during a [[cell cycle]]. [[Histone]] proteins are the basic packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing ([[Histone modification]]). Most of the modifications occur on the histone tail. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified and the type of modification. For example, Histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a [[bivalent chromatin|bivalent]] structure (with tri-methylation of both Lysine 4 and 27 on histone H3) was involved in mammalian early development.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title= A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells\n|vauthors = Bernstein BE, Mikkelsen TS, Xie X, Kamal M, Huebert DJ, Cuff J, Fry B, Meissner A, Wernig M, Plath K, Jaenisch R, Wagschal A, Feil R, Schreiber SL, Lander ES \n|journal= [[Cell (journal)|Cell]]\n|date= April 2006\n|volume= 125\n|issue= 2\n|pages= 315\u201326\n|pmid= 16630819\n|issn= 0092-8674\n|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.041}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Polycomb-group proteins]] play a role in regulating genes through modulation of chromatin structure.<ref name= Portoso >{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg|vauthors=Portoso M, Cavalli G|year=2008|chapter=The Role of RNAi and Noncoding RNAs in Polycomb Mediated Control of Gene Expression and Genomic Programming|title=RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-25-7}}</ref>\n\nFor additional information, see [[Histone#Histone modifications in chromatin regulation|Histone modifications in chromatin regulation]] and [[RNA polymerase control by chromatin structure#RNA polymerase control by chromatin structure|RNA polymerase control by chromatin structure]].\n\n===DNA structure===\n[[File:A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA.png|thumb|right|300px|The structures of A-, B-, and Z-DNA.]]\n{{main|Mechanical properties of DNA|Z-DNA}}\nIn nature, DNA can form three structures, A-, B-, and [[Z-DNA]]. A- and B-DNA are very similar, forming right-handed helices, whereas Z-DNA is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.\n\nAt the junction of B- and Z-DNA, one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from [[RNA polymerase]] or nucleosome binding.\n<!---\n Move to [[mechanical properties of DNA]] or [[Z-DNA]]? \"===DNA structure===\n[[File:B&Z&A DNA formula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Fig. 2:''' Alternative structural forms of DNA influencing chromatin structure]]\n\n===Chromatin and Watson/Crick base pairing===\nCrick and Watson's famous structure of [[DNA]] (called B-DNA) is only one of three possible structural forms (Fig. 2).\n\nFor the C-N bond between a base and its sugar, there are two different conformations. The anti-conformation occurs in all A- and B-DNAs as well as in Z-DNA where a Cytosine is present.\nIn case of a Guanine, Z-DNA takes the syn-conformation. The periodic change between a purine and pyrimidine along the strand of a Z-DNA accomplishes the alternating syn-anti-conformation characteristic of the zigzag structure of the Z-DNA helix. The yellow circles designated A, B, Z indicate the axes of the three possible types of DNA (Fig. 2).\n\n[[File:B&Z junction DNA.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Fig. 3:''' Structure of DNA with two B-Z DNA junctions: It encompasses 1. breakage of a hydrogen-bond, where a Guanine rotates around its glycosyl-bond and the sugar thereby transforms into its syn-conformation. 2. Rotation of the corresponding second base (Cytosine) involving rotation of the sugar around the sugar-phosphate-bond. 3. At the B-Z junction hydrogen-bonds remain broken and bases are extruded.]]\n\n===Junction between B- and Z-DNA===\nChromatin regions near the transcription start site frequently contain DNA sequence motifs favourable for forming Z-DNA. Likewise, formation of Z-DNA near the promoter region stimulates transcription. Z-DNA is stabilized by binding specific proteins. Formation of Z-DNA from B-DNA is a dynamic process wherein B-DNA is the relaxed state. When a Z-DNA segment is formed two B-Z junctions form (Fig.3). The crystal structure of such junctions is known. At each junction the hydrogen bonds between a Watson/Crick base-pair is broken and the bases are extruded. Extrusion of a base from the helix is a well-known reaction performed by enzymes (i.e., DNA glycosylase) that edit or repair DNA during Base Excision Repair (BER). Crystal structures of extruded bases co-crystallized with Hha1 methyltransferase, human DNA repair protein AGT(O(6)-alkylguanine-DNAalkyltransferase), or bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V are similar to the extruded bases at B-Z junctions. Z-DNA may also provide a sink to absorb torsional strain following an RNA polymerase or a transient nucleosome. Also, Z-DNA may represent a signal for the recruitment of RNA-editing enzymes. It is possible that chromatin encompassing Z-DNA segments also affect replication.\" --->\n\n===Nucleosomes and beads-on-a-string===\n:''Main articles: [[Nucleosome]], [[Chromatosome]] and [[Histone]]''\n[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|left|150px|A cartoon representation of the nucleosome structure. From {{PDB|1KX5}}.]]\nThe basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of [[linker DNA]], a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.\n\nIn addition to the core histones, there is the linker histone, H1, which contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome core particle, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome.  Nucleosomes, with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, can form, under non-physiological conditions, an approximately 10&nbsp;nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre. (Fig. 1-2). .\n\nThe nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging.  There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning.  This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the inner minor groove. (See [[mechanical properties of DNA]].)\n\n===30-nanometer chromatin fibre===\n[[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|right|200px|Two proposed structures of the 30 nm chromatin filament. <br />Left: 1 start helix \"solenoid\" structure. <br />Right: 2 start loose helix structure. <br />Note: the histones are omitted in this diagram - only the DNA is shown.]]\nWith addition of H1, the beads-on-a-string structure in turn coils into a 30&nbsp;nm diameter helical structure known as the 30&nbsp;nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fibre in the cell is not known in detail, and there is still some debate over this.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Annunziato|first1=Anthony T.|title=DNA Packaging: Nucleosomes and Chromatin|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-packaging-nucleosomes-and-chromatin-310|website=Scitable|publisher=Nature Education|accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nThis level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of [[heterochromatin]], which contains mostly transcriptionally silent genes. EM studies have demonstrated that the 30&nbsp;nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10&nbsp;nm fiber (\"beads-on-a-string\") structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.\n\n[[File:ChromatinFibers.png|thumb|left|250px|Four proposed structures of the 30&nbsp;nm chromatin filament for DNA repeat length per nucleosomes ranging from 177 to 207 bp.\n<br />\nLinker DNA in yellow and nucleosomal DNA in pink.]]\nThe existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.\nA stable 30&nbsp;nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.\nIn this view, different lengths of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber.

The structure of the condensed chromatin is thought to be loops of 30&nbsp;nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues.It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called [[bookmarking]], which is an [[epigenetic]] mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the \"memory\" of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Xing H, Vanderford NL, Sarge KD |title=The TBP-PP2A mitotic complex bookmarks genes by preventing condensin action |journal=Nat.

The acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access.\n\nWhen the chromatin decondenses, the DNA is open to entry of molecular machinery. Fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute to the discontinuity of transcription, or [[transcriptional bursting]].  Other factors are probably involved, such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin.  The phenomenon, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations<ref name=\"pmid22944281\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaochar S, Tu BP |title=Gatekeepers of chromatin: Small metabolites elicit big changes in gene expression |journal=Trends Biochem.

The natural expectation is that in the presence of type II DNA topoisomerases that permit passages of double-stranded DNA regions through each other, all chromosomes should reach the state of topological equilibrium. The topological equilibrium in highly crowded interphase chromosomes forming chromosome territories would result in formation of highly knotted chromatin fibres. However, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methods revealed that the decay of contacts with the genomic distance in interphase chromosomes is practically the same as in the crumpled globule state that is formed when long polymers condense without formation of any knots. To remove knots from highly crowded chromatin, one would need an active process that should not only provide the energy to move the system from the state of topological equilibrium but also guide topoisomerase-mediated passages in such a way that knots would be efficiently unknotted instead of making the knots even more complex. It has been shown that the process of chromatin-loop extrusion is ideally suited to actively unknot chromatin fibres in interphase chromosomes.<ref>\n{{cite biorxiv |last1=Racko |first1=D. |last2=Benedetti |first2=F. |last3=Goundaroulis |first3=D. |last4=Stasiak |first4=A. |date=8 September 2018 |title=Chromatin-loop extrusion and chromatin unknotting. |biorxiv=411629}}\n</ref>\n\n==Chromatin: alternative definitions==\n\nThe term, introduced by [[Walther Flemming]], has multiple meanings:\n# '''Simple and concise definition:''' Chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a DNA macromolecule and protein macromolecules (and RNA).

This is used to measure how [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] a function is to changes or errors in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input. Very frequently, one is solving the inverse problem \u2013 given <math>f(x) = y,</math> one is solving for ''x,'' and thus the condition number of the (local) inverse must be used.

The \"function\" is the solution of a problem and the \"arguments\" are the data in the problem. The condition number is frequently applied to questions in linear algebra, in which case the derivative is straightforward but the error could be in many different directions, and is thus computed from the geometry of the matrix. More generally, condition numbers can be defined for non-linear functions in several variables.\n\nA problem with a low condition number is said to be '''well-conditioned''', while a problem with a high condition number is said to be '''ill-conditioned'''. The condition number is a property of the problem.  Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution.  Some algorithms have a property called '''[[Numerical stability|backward stability]]'''. In general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems. Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify known backward stable algorithms.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if the condition number <math>\\kappa(A) = 10^k</math>, then you may lose up to <math>k</math> digits of accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss of precision from arithmetic methods.<ref name=\"Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUfVZELlrMEC&pg=PA321 |title= Numerical Mathematics and Computing |last1=Cheney |last2=Kincaid |isbn= 978-0-495-11475-8 |date=2007-08-03 }}</ref> However, the condition number does not give the exact value of the maximum inaccuracy that may occur in the algorithm. It generally just bounds it with an estimate (whose computed value depends on the choice of the norm to measure the inaccuracy).\n\n== Matrices ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Invertible matrix]] -->\n\nFor example, the condition number associated with the [[linear equation]]\n''Ax''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b'' gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution ''x'' will be after approximation. Note that this is before the effects of [[round-off error]] are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the [[algorithm]] or [[floating point]] accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution, ''x'', will change with respect to a change in ''b''.  Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in ''b'' may cause a large error in ''x''. On the other hand, if the condition number is small then the error in ''x'' will not be much bigger than the error in ''b''.\n\nThe condition number is defined more precisely to be the maximum ratio of the [[relative error]] in ''x'' to the relative error in ''b''.\n\nLet ''e'' be the error in ''b''. Assuming that ''A'' is a nonsingular matrix, the error in the solution ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''b'' is ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''e''. The ratio of the relative error in the solution to the relative error in ''b'' is\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\frac{ \\left\\| A^{-1} e \\right\\| } {\\left\\| A^{-1} b \\right\\|} }{\\frac{\\| e \\|}{\\| b\\|}} </math>\n\nThis is easily transformed to\n\n: <math>\\left(\\frac{ \\left\\| A^{-1} e \\right\\|} {\\| e\\|} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\| b\\|}{\\left\\| A^{-1} b \\right\\| } \\right) .</math>\n\nThe maximum value (for nonzero ''b'' and ''e'') is then seen to be the product of the two [[operator norm]]s as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\max_{e,b \\neq 0} \\left \\{ \\left(\\frac{\\left\\| A^{-1}e\\right\\| }{\\| e\\|}\\right)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\| b\\|}{\\left\\| A^{-1}b\\right\\|}\\right) \\right \\} &= \\max_{e \\neq 0} \\left \\{\\frac {\\left\\| A^{-1}e\\right\\| }{\\| e\\|} \\right \\} \\cdot \\max_{b \\neq 0} \\left \\{ \\frac {\\| b \\|}{\\left\\| A^{-1}b\\right\\|} \\right \\} \\\\\n&= \\max_{e \\neq 0} \\left \\{\\frac{\\left\\| A^{-1}e\\right\\|}{\\| e \\|}\\right \\} \\cdot \\max_{x \\neq 0} \\left \\{\\frac {\\| Ax\\| }{\\| x\\|} \\right \\} \\\\\n&= \\left \\|A^{-1} \\right \\| \\cdot \\|A\\|\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe same definition is used for any consistent [[matrix norm|norm]], i.e. one that satisfies\n\n: <math> \\kappa(A) = \\left\\| A^{-1} \\right\\| \\cdot \\left\\| A \\right\\| \\ge \\left\\| A^{-1} \\cdot A \\right\\| = 1 .</math>\n\nWhen the condition number is exactly one (which can only happen if ''A'' is a  scalar multiple of a [[Isometry#Linear isometry|linear isometry]]), then a solution algorithm can  find (in principle, meaning if the algorithm introduces no errors of its own) an approximation of the solution whose precision is no worse than that of the data.\n\nHowever, it does not mean that the algorithm will converge rapidly to this solution, just that it won't diverge arbitrarily because of inaccuracy on the source data (backward error), provided that the forward error introduced by the algorithm does not diverge as well because of accumulating intermediate rounding errors.{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe condition number may also be infinite, but this implies that the problem is [[well-posed problem|ill-posed]] (does not possess a unique, well-defined solution for each choice of data -- that is, the matrix is not invertible), and no algorithm can be expected to reliably find a solution.\n\nThe definition of the condition number depends on the choice of norm, as can be illustrated by two examples.\n\nIf <math>\\| \\cdot\\| </math> is the [[matrix norm|norm]] defined in the square-summable [[sequence space]] [[Lp space|\u2113<sup>2</sup>]] (which matches the usual distance in a standard Euclidean space and is usually noted as <math>\\| \\cdot \\|_2 </math>), then\n\n: <math> \\kappa(A) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}(A)}{\\sigma_{\\min}(A)},</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\sigma_{\\max}(A)</math> and <math>\\sigma_{\\min}(A)</math> are maximal and minimal [[singular value]]s of <math>A</math> respectively. Hence\n\n* If <math>A</math> is [[normal matrix|normal]] then\n::<math> \\kappa(A) = \\frac{\\left|\\lambda_{\\max}(A)\\right|}{\\left|\\lambda_{\\min}(A)\\right|} ,</math>\n:where <math>\\lambda_{\\max}(A)</math> and <math>\\lambda_{\\min}(A) </math> are maximal and minimal (by moduli) [[eigenvalue]]s of <math>A</math> respectively.\n\n* If <math>A</math> is [[unitary matrix|unitary]] then <math> \\kappa(A) = 1 .</math>\n\nThe condition number with respect to ''L''<sup>2</sup> arises so often in numerical [[linear algebra]] that it is given a name, the '''condition number of a matrix'''.\n\nIf <math>\\| \\cdot \\| </math> is the [[matrix norm|norm]] defined in the [[sequence space]] [[Lp space|\u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>]] of all [[Bounded operator|bounded]] sequences (which matches the maximum of distances measured on projections into the base subspaces and is usually denoted by <math>\\| \\cdot \\|_\\infty </math>), and <math>A</math> is [[triangular matrix|lower triangular]] non-singular (i.e., <math>\\forall i, a_{ii} \\ne 0</math>) then\n\n: <math> \\kappa(A) \\geq \\frac{\\max_i(|a_{ii}|)}{\\min_i(|a_{ii}|)} .</math>\n\nThe condition number computed with this norm is generally larger than the condition number computed with square-summable sequences, but it can be evaluated more easily (and this is often the only practicably computable condition number, when the problem to solve involves a ''non-linear algebra''{{what?|date=October 2014}}, for example when approximating irrational and transcendental functions or numbers with numerical methods).\n\nIf the condition number is not too much larger than one  (but it can still be a multiple of one), the matrix is well conditioned which means its inverse can be computed with good accuracy. If the condition number is very large, then the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. Practically, such a matrix is almost singular, and the computation of its inverse, or solution of a linear system of equations is prone to large numerical errors. A matrix that is not invertible has condition number equal to infinity.\n\n== Nonlinear ==\nCondition numbers can also be defined for nonlinear functions, and can be computed using calculus. The condition number varies with the point; in some cases one can use the maximum (or supremum) condition number over the domain of the function or domain of the question as an overall condition number, while in other cases the condition number at a particular point is of more interest.\n\n=== One variable ===\n{{See also|Significance arithmetic#Transcendental functions}}\n\nThe condition number of a differentiable function ''f'' in one variable as a function is <math>xf'/f.</math> Evaluated at a point ''x'' this is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{xf'(x)}{f(x)}.</math>\n\nMost elegantly, this can be understood as (the absolute value of) the ratio of the [[logarithmic derivative]] of ''f,'' which is <math>(\\log f)' = f'/f</math> and the logarithmic derivative of ''x,'' which is <math>(\\log x)' = x'/x = 1/x,</math> yielding a ratio of <math>xf'/f.</math> This is because the logarithmic derivative is the infinitesimal rate of relative change in a function: it is the derivative <math>f'</math> scaled by the value of ''f.'' Note that if a function has a zero at a point, its condition number at the point is infinite, as infinitesimal changes in the input can change the output from zero to positive or negative, yielding a ratio with zero in the denominator, hence infinite relative change.\n\nMore directly, given a small change <math>\\Delta x</math> in ''x,'' the relative change in ''x'' is <math>[(x + \\Delta x) - x]/x = (\\Delta x)/x,</math> while the relative change in <math>f(x)</math> is <math>[f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)]/f(x).</math> Taking the ratio yields:\n\n:<math>\\frac{[f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)]/f(x)}{(\\Delta x)/x}= \\frac{x}{f(x)}\\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{(x + \\Delta x) - x}.</math>\n\nThe last term is the [[difference quotient]] (the slope of the secant line), and taking the limit yields the derivative.\n\nCondition numbers of common [[elementary function]]s are particularly important in computing [[significant figures]], and can be computed immediately from the derivative; see [[Significance arithmetic#Transcendental functions|significance arithmetic of transcendental functions]]. A few important ones are given below:\n* Exponential function <math>e^x</math>: <math>x</math>\n* Natural logarithm function <math>\\ln(x)</math>: <math>\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)}</math>\n* Sine function <math>\\sin(x)</math>: <math>x\\cot(x)</math>\n* Cosine function <math>\\cos(x)</math>: <math>x\\tan(x)</math>\n* Tangent function <math>\\tan(x)</math>: <math>x(\\tan(x)+\\cot(x))</math>\n* Inverse sine function <math>\\arcsin(x)</math>: <math>\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\arcsin(x)}</math>\n* Inverse cosine function <math>\\arccos(x)</math>: <math>\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\arccos(x)}</math>\n* Inverse tangent function <math>\\arctan(x)</math>: <math>\\frac{x}{(1+x^2)\\arctan(x)}</math>\n\n=== Several variables ===\n\nCondition numbers can be defined for any function ''f'' mapping its data from some [[function domain|domain]] (e.g. an ''m''-tuple of real numbers ''x'') into some [[codomain]] [e.g. an ''n''-tuple of real numbers ''f''(''x'')], where both the domain and codomain are [[Banach space]]s.  They express how sensitive that function is to small changes (or small errors) in its arguments.  This is crucial in assessing the sensitivity and potential accuracy difficulties of numerous computational problems, for example [[polynomial]] [[root finding]] or computing [[eigenvalue]]s.\n\nThe condition number of ''f'' at a point ''x'' (specifically, its '''relative condition number'''<ref name=TrefethenBau />) is then defined to be the maximum ratio of the fractional change in ''f''(''x'') to any fractional change in ''x'', in the limit where the change \u03b4''x'' in ''x'' becomes infinitesimally small:<ref name=TrefethenBau>{{cite book|isbn= 978-0-89871-361-9|first1=L.

The three orders of architecture\u2014the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\u2014originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], which they made simpler than Doric, and the [[Composite order|Composite]], which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.  The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the [[Musical mode|mode]] or [[Key (music)|key]] of [[classical music]], the [[grammar]] or [[rhetoric]] of a written composition.  It is established by certain ''modules'' like the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.<ref>Summerson, 7-15</ref>\n\nWhereas the orders were essentially structural in [[Ancient Greek architecture]], which made little use of the arch until its late period, in [[Roman architecture]] where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in [[portico]]s and similar uses.  Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into [[pilaster]]s.  This treatment continued after the conscious and \"correct\" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the [[Italian Renaissance]].<ref>Summerson, 19-21</ref>  [[Greek Revival architecture]], inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.\n\n== Elements ==\n[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]\n\nEach style has distinctive [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s at the top of columns and horizontal [[entablature]]s which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders.  The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].  The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its [[entasis]], beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly \"flared\", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.\n\nThe capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]], which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.  The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.  There are names for all the many parts of the orders.\n\n== Measurement ==\n[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|left|Greek orders with full height]] \nThe height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as \"lower diameters high\", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.\n\n== Greek orders ==\nThere are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.\n\nSometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.\n\nBoth the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.  Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style.  \n[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]\n\n=== Doric order===\n{{Main|Doric order}}\nThe Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.\n\nAbove the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.\n\nThe Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the [[stylobate]]. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.\n\n[[File:IonicCapitalPriene.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]\n\n=== Ionic order ===\n{{Main|Ionic order}}\nThe Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.\n\nThe Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.\n\n[[File:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]\n\n=== Corinthian order ===\n{{Main|Corinthian order}}\nThe Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.\n\nThe Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] [[Callimachus (sculptor)#Architecture|credited]] the invention of the Corinthian order to [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.\n\n== Roman orders ==\nThe Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]], respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders.  The Romans also invented the [[superposed order]]. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.\n\nThe [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.\n[[File:PalladioTuscan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Tuscan order in [[Andrea Palladio]], ''Quattro Libri di Architettura,'' 1570]]\n\n=== Tuscan order ===\n{{Main|Tuscan order}}\nThe Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.\n\n[[File:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]\n\n=== Composite order ===\n{{Main|Composite order}}\nThe Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.\n\n== Historical development of the orders ==\n[[File:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor, Ionic at the second floor, Corinthian at the third floor]]\n[[File:Bodleian Library 2 (5650412310).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tower of The Five Orders at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]], completed in 1619, includes Tuscan through Composite orders.]]\nThe [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: ''genus'' (gender), ''mos'' (habit, fashion, manner), ''opera'' (work).\n\nThe term ''order'', as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.<ref>H. Burns and H. Gunthers, ''24\u00e9me Colloque International d'Etude Humanistes'', Tours 1981</ref>\nEver since, the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821\u201323). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.<ref>Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm \"The five orders of classical architecture\"].</ref>\n\n== Vignola defining the concept of \"order\" ==\n{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}\n \nFollowing the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time,  the term '''order''' to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: ''Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura'' (''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture ''<ref>The most recent English translation is the one, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, N.Y. 1999</ref>). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book \"was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times\".<ref>David Watkin, Introduction to the ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture'', translated by John Leeke, reprint of the 1699 edition, N.Y., 2011</ref>\nThe book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises,  \"in accordance with Vitruvius\u2019s example, Vignola chose a \u201cmodule\u201d equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a fa\u00e7ade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement\".[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES64.asp?param=en]\n\nIn America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',<ref>{{cite book| last = Benjamin| first = Asher| title = The American Builder's Companion: Or, a System of Architecture Particularly Adapted to the Present Style of Building| year = 1827| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22236-3 }}</ref> written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's ''Regola'', was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ware| first = William R.| title = The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC| year = 1994| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-28310-4| pages = 160 }}</ref>\n\nThe break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.\n\n== Nonce orders ==\nSeveral orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed \"''nonce orders''\" by analogy to ''[[nonce word]]s''; several examples follow below. \nThese nonce orders all express the \u201cspeaking architecture\u201d (''[[architecture parlante]]'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875\u20131915. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n;British Order\n[[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau|Cl\u00e9risseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''' and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]].\n\n;Ammonite order and Agricultural order\nIn 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].<ref name=\"oxford22\">{{cite book |last1=Curl |first1=James Stevens |last2=Wilson |first2=Susan |title=Oxford Dictionary of Architecture |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967499-2 |page=22}}</ref> An adaptation of the Corinthian order by [[William Donthorne]] that used turnip leaves and [[mangelwurzel]] is termed the '''Agricultural order'''.<ref>Curl, p.&nbsp;238</ref><ref>Curl, p.&nbsp;11</ref>\n\n[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the [[Litchfield Villa]] [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[Alexander Jackson Davis|A.J.

Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24&nbsp;August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, 5&nbsp;November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for \"the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate\" ({{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html |title=United States Capitol exhibit}}).\n\n[[File:Anglo-Indian (3819948065).jpg|thumb|right|The '''Delhi order''' at [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], [[New Delhi]] ]]\n;Delhi order\n[[Edwin Lutyens]], who from 1912 laid out [[New Delhi]] as the new seat of government for the [[British Empire in India]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Gradidge |first=Roderick |title=Edwin Lutyens: Architect Laureate |year=1981 |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |location=London, UK |isbn=0-04-720023-5 |page=69}}</ref> designed a '''Delhi Order''' having a capital displaying a band of vertical ridges, and with bells hanging at each corner as a replacement for volutes.<ref name=Gradidge151>{{cite book |last=Gradidge |first=Roderick |title=Edwin Lutyens: Architect Laureate |year=1981 |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |location=London |isbn=0-04-720023-5 |page=151}}</ref> His design for the new city's central palace, Viceroy's House, now the Presidential residence [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], was a thorough integration of elements of [[Indian architecture]] into a building of classical forms and proportions,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilhide |first=Elizabeth |title=Sir Edwin Lutyens: Designing in the English Tradition |year=2012 |publisher=National Trust Books |location=London |isbn=9781907892271 |pages=41\u201342}}</ref> and made use of the order throughout.<ref name=Gradidge151/> The Delhi Order reappears in some later Lutyens buildings including [[Campion Hall, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gradidge |first=Roderick |title=Edwin Lutyens: Architect Laureate |year=1981 |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |location=London |isbn=0-04-720023-5 |page=161}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Architecture}}\n* [[Temple (Greek)]]\n* [[Temple (Roman)]]\n* ''[[De architectura]]'' by [[Vitruvius]]\n* [[Persian column]]\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = left\n | video1 =[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/v/the-classical-orders Smarthistory - The Classical orders ] A Smarthistory video.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[[John Summerson|Summerson, John]], ''[[The Classical Language of Architecture]]'', 1980 edition, [[Thames and Hudson]] ''World of Art'' series, {{ISBN|0500201773}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Classical order\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n* Barletta, Barbara A., ''The Origins of the Greek Architectural Orders'' (Cambridge University Press) 2001\n* Barozzi da Vignola, Giacomo,  ''Canon of the Five Orders'', Translated into English, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, Acanthus Press, N.Y., 1999\n* Barozzi da Vignola, Giacomo, ''Canon of the Five Orders'', Translated by John Leeke (1669), with an introduction by David Watkin, Dover Publications, N.Y., 2011\n* {{cite book| last = Chitham|first= Robert|authorlink = Robert Chitham |title = The Classical Orders Of Architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YWCnUT0-5xwC| year = 2005| publisher = Elsevier/Architectural Press| isbn = 978-0-7506-6124-9 }}\n* {{cite book| author = James Stevens Curl| title = Classical Architecture: An Introduction to Its Vocabulary and Essentials, With a Select Glossary of Terms| year = 2003| publisher = W.

They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later. She held the position of ambassador of the Aragonese Crown to England in 1507, the first female ambassador in European history.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}} Catherine subsequently married Arthur's younger brother, the recently ascended Henry VIII, in 1509. For six months in 1513, she served as [[regent]] of England while Henry&nbsp;VIII was in France. During that time the English won the [[Battle of Flodden]], an event in which Catherine played an important part with an emotional speech about English courage.{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England}}\n\nBy 1525, Henry VIII was infatuated with [[Anne Boleyn]] and dissatisfied that his marriage to Catherine had produced no surviving sons, leaving their daughter, the future [[Mary&nbsp;I of England]], as [[heir presumptive]] at a time when there was no established precedent for a woman on the throne. He sought to have their marriage [[Annulment|annulled]], setting in motion a chain of events that led to England's schism with the Catholic Church. When [[Pope Clement&nbsp;VII]] refused to annul the marriage, Henry defied him by [[Acts of Supremacy|assuming supremacy]] over religious matters. In 1533 their marriage was consequently declared invalid and Henry married Anne on the judgement of clergy in England, without reference to the Pope. Catherine refused to accept Henry as Supreme Head of the Church in England and considered herself the King's rightful wife and queen, attracting much popular sympathy.{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon (1485\u20131536)}} Despite this, she was acknowledged only as Dowager Princess of Wales by Henry. After being banished from court, she lived out the remainder of her life at [[Kimbolton Castle]], and died there on 7 January 1536. English people held Catherine in high esteem, and her death set off tremendous mourning.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=295}}\n\nThe controversial book ''[[The Education of a Christian Woman]]'' by [[Juan Luis Vives]], which claimed women have the right to an education, was commissioned by and dedicated to her.

She resembles her sister [[Joanna of Castile]].]]\nCatherine was born at the [[Archbishop's Palace of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]] near Madrid, on the night of 16 December 1485. She was the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand&nbsp;II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella&nbsp;I of Castile]].{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=283}} Catherine was quite short in stature{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=24}} with long red hair, wide blue eyes, a round face, and a fair complexion.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=15}} She was descended, on her maternal side, from the English royal house; her great-grandmother [[Catherine of Lancaster]], after whom she was named, and her great-great-grandmother [[Philippa of Lancaster]] were both daughters of [[John of Gaunt]] and granddaughters of [[Edward&nbsp;III of England]]. Consequently, she was third cousin of her father-in-law, [[Henry VII of England]],{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284}} and fourth cousin of her mother-in-law [[Elizabeth of York]].\n\nCatherine was educated by a tutor, [[Alessandro Geraldini]], who was a clerk in Holy Orders. She studied arithmetic, canon and civil law, classical literature, genealogy and heraldry, history, philosophy, religion, and theology.  She had a strong religious upbringing and developed her Roman Catholic faith that would play a major role in later life.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=12}} She learned to speak, read and write in Spanish and Latin, and spoke French and Greek. She was also taught domestic skills, such as cooking, dancing, drawing, embroidery, good manners, lace-making, music, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=20}} Scholar [[Erasmus]] later said that Catherine \"loved good literature which she had studied with success since childhood\".{{sfn|Dowling|1986|p=17}}\n\nAt an early age, Catherine was considered a suitable wife for [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], heir apparent to the English throne, due to the English ancestry she inherited from her mother. By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]: [[Blanche of Lancaster]] and [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]]. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to [[Katherine Swynford]], whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry's descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the [[House of Trast\u00e1mara]] was the most prestigious in Europe,{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284}} due to the rule of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were [[married by proxy]] on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to be married.{{sfn|Sanders & Low|1910|p=235}}\n\nWhen Catherine of Aragon travelled to London, she brought a group of her African attendants with her, including one identified as the trumpeter [[John Blanke]].{{sfn|John Blanke}} They are the first Africans recorded to have arrived in London at the time, and were considered luxury servants.

The death of Catherine's mother, however, meant that her \"value\" in the marriage market decreased. Castile was a much larger kingdom than Aragon, and it was inherited by Catherine's mentally unstable elder sister, [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. Ostensibly, the marriage was delayed until Henry was old enough, but Ferdinand II procrastinated so much over payment of the remainder of Catherine's dowry that it became doubtful that the marriage would take place. She lived as a virtual prisoner at [[Durham House (London)|Durham House]] in London.{{sfn|Williams|1971|p=15}} Some of the letters she wrote to her father complaining of her treatment have survived. In one of these letters she tells him that \"I choose what I believe, and say nothing.

In 1507 she served as the Spanish [[ambassador]] to England, the first female ambassador in European history.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}} While Henry VII and his councillors expected her to be easily manipulated, Catherine went on to prove them wrong.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}}\n\nMarriage to Arthur's brother depended on the Pope granting a [[Papal dispensation|dispensation]] because [[canon law]] forbade a man to [[Affinity (canon law)|marry his brother's widow]] ([[Leviticus 18|Lev. 18]]:16{{efn|[[Canon law]] took this verse out of context, and [[Deuteronomy 25]]:5\u201310 required [[levirate marriage]].}}).

She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter, Mary.

Henry began pursuing her;{{sfn|Scarisbrick|1997|p=154}} Catherine was no longer able to bear children by this time.

Henry refused her the right to any title but \"[[Dowager]] Princess of Wales\" in recognition of her position as his brother's widow.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=292}}\n\nCatherine went to live at [[The More]] castle in the winter of 1531/32.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293}} In 1535 she was transferred to [[Kimbolton Castle]]. There, she confined herself to one room (which she left only to attend Mass), dressed only in the [[hair shirt]] of the Order of St. Francis, and fasted continuously. While she was permitted to receive occasional visitors, she was forbidden to see her daughter Mary. They were also forbidden to communicate in writing, but sympathizers discreetly ferried letters between the two. Henry offered both mother and daughter better quarters and permission to see each other if they would acknowledge Anne Boleyn as the new queen. Both refused.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293}}\n\nIn late December 1535, sensing her death was near, Catherine made her [[will (law)|will]], and wrote to her nephew, the Emperor Charles V, asking him to protect her daughter. It has been alleged that she then penned one final letter to Henry, her \"most dear lord and husband\":<ref>Sharon Turner, ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'' (Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green,1828)</ref>\n{{quotation|My most dear lord, king and husband,\n\nThe hour of my death now drawing on, the tender love I owe you forceth me, my case being such, to commend myself to you, and to put you in remembrance with a few words of the health and safeguard of your soul which you ought to prefer before all worldly matters, and before the care and pampering of your body, for the which you have cast me into many calamities and yourself into many troubles. For my part, I pardon you everything, and I wish to devoutly pray God that He will pardon you also. For the rest, I commend unto you our daughter Mary, beseeching you to be a good father unto her, as I have heretofore desired.

Another theory is that the dressing in yellow was out of respect for Catherine as yellow was said to be the Spanish colour of mourning. Certainly, later in the day it is reported that Henry and Anne both individually and privately wept for her death. On the day of Catherine's funeral, Anne Boleyn [[miscarriage|miscarried]] a boy.

The American historian [[Garrett Mattingly]] was the author of a popular biography ''Katherine of Aragon'' in 1942. In 1966, Catherine and her many supporters at court were the subjects of ''Catherine of Aragon and her Friends'', a biography by John E. Paul. In 1967, Mary M.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry&nbsp;VIII]]'' succeeds in recreating with great accuracy Catherine's statement about the legitimacy of her marriage at the court in Blackfriars before King Henry, and Shakespeare's portrayal of Catherine is remarkably sympathetic; however, most of the rest of the play is an attempt to absolve many, especially Henry&nbsp;VIII, and the timing of key incidents (including Catherine's death) is changed and other events are avoided (the play makes Henry nearly an innocent pawn in the hands of a dastardly Cardinal Wolsey, and the play stops short of Anne Boleyn's execution).\n\nIn January, 2013, the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London revealed that its curators had recently discovered that a portrait at [[Lambeth Palace]] formerly believed to have been a portrait of Catherine Parr in fact shows Catherine of Aragon.

Thomson]] showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the ''electron''. [[Cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image on a television screen.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Crookes tube2 diagram.svg|thumb|A diagram showing a Crookes tube connected to a high voltage supply.  The Maltese cross has no external electrical connection.]]\n\nCathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode, or [[cathode]], in a vacuum tube. To release electrons into the tube, they first must be detached from the [[atom]]s of the cathode. In the early [[cold cathode]] vacuum tubes, called [[Crookes tube]]s, this was done by using a high electrical potential of thousands of [[volt]]s between the anode and the cathode to [[ionization|ionize]] the residual gas atoms in the tube.  The positive ions were accelerated by the [[electric field]] toward the cathode, and when they collided with it they knocked electrons out if its surface; these were the cathode rays.   Modern vacuum tubes use [[thermionic emission]], in which the cathode is made of a thin wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] which is heated by a separate [[electric current]] passing through it. The increased random heat motion of the filament knocks electrons out of the surface of the filament, into the evacuated space of the tube.\n\nSince the electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the negative cathode and attracted to the positive anode. They travel in straight lines through the empty tube. The voltage applied between the electrodes accelerates these low mass particles to high velocities. Cathode rays are invisible, but their presence was first detected in early vacuum tubes when they struck the glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to emit light, a glow called [[fluorescence]]. Researchers noticed that objects placed in the tube in front of the cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall, and realized that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode. After the electrons reach the anode, they travel through the anode wire to the power supply and back to the cathode, so cathode rays carry electric current through the tube.\n\nThe current in a beam of cathode rays through a vacuum tube can be controlled by passing it through a metal screen of wires (a [[Control grid|grid]]) between cathode and anode, to which a small negative voltage is applied. The electric field of the wires deflects some of the electrons, preventing them from reaching the anode. The amount of current that gets through to the anode depends on the voltage on the grid. Thus, a small voltage on the grid can be made to control a much larger voltage on the anode. This is the principle used in [[vacuum tube]]s to [[Amplifier|amplify]] electrical signals. The [[triode]] vacuum tube developed between 1907 and 1914 was the first electronic device that could amplify, and is still used in some applications such as [[radio transmitter]]s. High speed beams of cathode rays can also be steered and manipulated by [[electric field]]s created by additional metal plates in the tube to which voltage is applied, or [[magnetic field]]s created by coils of wire ([[electromagnet]]s). These are used in [[cathode ray tubes]], found in televisions and computer monitors, and in [[electron microscope]]s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\">\n  File:Kat\u00f3dsugarak m\u00e1gneses mez\u0151ben(1).jpg|Crookes tube.

In 1705, it was noted that [[electrostatic generator]] sparks travel a longer distance through low pressure air than through atmospheric pressure air.\n\n===Gas discharge tubes===\n[[File:Glow discharge regions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Glow discharge]] in a low-pressure tube caused by electric current.]]\n\nIn 1838, [[Michael Faraday]] applied a high voltage between two metal [[electrode]]s at either end of a glass tube that had been partially evacuated of air, and noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) and its end are at the [[anode]] (positive electrode).<ref>Michael Faraday (1838) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ypNDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false \"VIII.  Experimental researches in electricity. \u2014 Thirteenth series.,\"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''128''' :  125-168.</ref> In 1857, German physicist and glassblower [[Heinrich Geissler]] sucked even more air out with an improved pump, to a pressure of around 10<sup>\u22123</sup> [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] and found that, instead of an arc, a glow filled the tube. The voltage applied between the two electrodes of the tubes, generated by an [[induction coil]], was anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV. These were called [[Geissler tube]]s, similar to today's [[neon sign]]s.\n\nThe explanation of these effects was that the high voltage accelerated free [[electron]]s and electrically charged [[atom]]s ([[ion]]s)  naturally present in the air of the tube.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} At low pressure, there was enough space between the gas atoms that the electrons could accelerate to high enough speeds that when they struck an atom they knocked electrons off of it, creating more positive ions and free electrons, which went on to create more ions and electrons in a chain reaction,{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} known as a [[glow discharge]].  The positive ions were attracted to the [[cathode]] and when they struck it knocked more electrons out of it, which were attracted toward the anode.  Thus the ionized air was electrically conductive and an electric current flowed through the tube.\n\nGeissler tubes  had enough air in them that the electrons could only travel a tiny distance before colliding with an atom. The electrons in these tubes moved in a slow [[diffusion]] process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn't produce cathode rays. Instead, they produced a colorful [[glow discharge]] (as in a modern [[neon light]]), caused when the electrons struck gas atoms, exciting their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. The electrons released this energy as light. This process is called [[fluorescence]].\n\n===Cathode rays===\n[[File:Crookes tube two views.jpg|thumb|A Crookes tube. The cathode rays travel in straight lines from the cathode ''(left)'' and strike the right wall of the tube, making it glow by fluorescence.]]\n\nBy the 1870s, British physicist [[William Crookes]] and others were able to evacuate tubes to a lower pressure, below 10<sup>\u22126</sup> atm. These were called [[Crookes tube]]s. Faraday had been the first to notice a dark space just in front of the cathode, where there was no luminescence. This came to be called the \"cathode dark space\", \"Faraday dark space\" or \"Crookes dark space\". Crookes found that as he pumped more air out of the tubes, the Faraday dark space spread down the tube from the cathode toward the anode, until the tube was totally dark. But at the anode (positive) end of the tube, the glass of the tube itself began to glow.\n\nWhat was happening was that as more air was pumped from the tube, the electrons knocked out of the cathode when positive ions struck it could travel farther, on average, before they struck a gas atom. By the time the tube was dark, most of the electrons could travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode end of the tube without a collision. With no obstructions, these low mass particles were accelerated to high velocities by the voltage between the electrodes.  These were the cathode rays.\n\nWhen they reached the anode end of the tube, they were traveling so fast that, although they were attracted to it, they often flew past the anode and struck the back wall of the tube. When they struck atoms in the glass wall, they excited their orbital electrons to higher [[energy level]]s.  When the electrons returned to their original energy level, they released the energy as light, causing the glass to [[fluoresce]], usually a greenish or bluish color.  Later researchers painted the inside back wall with fluorescent chemicals such as [[zinc sulfide]], to make the glow more visible.\n\nCathode rays themselves are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube in front of the cathode, such as the anode, cast sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall. In 1869, German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] was first to realize that something must be traveling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows. [[Eugen Goldstein]] named them ''cathode rays'' (German ''kathodenstrahlen'').\n\n===Discovery of the electron===\nAt this time, atoms were the smallest particles known, and were believed to be indivisible. What carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last quarter of the 19th century, many experiments were done to determine what cathode rays were. There were two theories. Crookes and [[Arthur Schuster]] believed they were particles of \"radiant matter,\" that is, electrically charged atoms. German scientists Eilhard Wiedemann, [[Heinrich Hertz]] and Goldstein believed they were \"aether waves\", some new form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], and were separate from what carried the electric current through the tube.\n\nThe debate was resolved in 1897 when [[J. J. Thomson]] measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, [[hydrogen]]. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first ''[[subatomic particle|subatomic]]'' particle to be discovered, which he originally called \"''corpuscle''\" but was later named ''electron'', after particles postulated by [[George Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874. He also showed they were identical with particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials.<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Thomson\n  | first = J.

[[Philipp Lenard]] also contributed a great deal to cathode ray theory, winning the Nobel prize for physics in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and their properties.\n\n===Vacuum tubes===\nThe gas ionization (or [[cold cathode]]) method of producing cathode rays used in Crookes tubes was unreliable, because it depended on the pressure of the residual air in the tube. Over time, the air was absorbed by the walls of the tube, and it stopped working.\n\nA more reliable and controllable method of producing cathode rays was investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and rediscovered by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880. A cathode made of a wire filament heated red hot by a separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The first true electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], used this [[hot cathode]] technique, and they superseded Crookes tubes. These tubes didn't need gas in them to work, so they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around 10<sup>\u22129</sup> atm (10<sup>\u22124</sup> Pa). The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[krytron]]s.\n\nIn 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] found that a small voltage on a grid of metal wires could control a much larger current in a beam of cathode rays passing through a vacuum tube. His invention, called the [[triode]], was the first device that could [[amplifier|amplify]] electric signals, and revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of ''[[electronics]]''. Vacuum tubes made [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]] possible, as well as [[radar]], talking movies, audio recording, and long distance telephone service, and were the foundation of consumer electronic devices until the 1960s, when the [[transistor]] brought the era of vacuum tubes to a close.\n\nCathode rays are now usually called electron beams. The technology of manipulating electron beams pioneered in these early tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, particularly in the invention of the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) by [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897, which was used in [[television set]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s. It is today employed in sophisticated devices such as [[electron microscope]]s, [[electron beam lithography]] and  [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\n==Properties==\nLike a wave, cathode rays travel in straight lines, and produce a shadow when obstructed by objects. [[Ernest Rutherford]] demonstrated that rays could pass through thin metal foils, behavior expected of a particle. These conflicting properties caused disruptions when trying to classify it as a wave or particle. Crookes insisted it was a particle, while Hertz maintained it was a wave. The debate was resolved when an electric field was used to deflect the rays by J. J. Thomson. This was evidence that the beams were composed of particles  because scientists knew it was impossible to deflect electromagnetic waves with an electric field. These can also create mechanical effects, fluorescence, etc.\n\n[[Louis de Broglie]] later (1924) showed in his doctoral dissertation that electrons are in fact much like photons in the respect that they act both as waves and as particles in a [[Wave\u2013particle duality|dual manner]] as [[Einstein]] had shown earlier for light. The wave-like behaviour of cathode rays was later directly demonstrated using a crystal lattice by [[Davisson\u2013Germer experiment|Davisson and Germer]] in 1927.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpha particle|\u03b1 (alpha) particles]]\n*[[Beta particle|\u03b2 (beta) particles]]\n*[[Deflection yoke]]\n*[[Electron beam processing]]\n*[[Electron microscope]]\n*[[Electron beam melting]]\n*[[Electron beam welding]]\n*[[Electron beam technology]]\n*[[Electron gun]]\n*[[Electron irradiation]]\n*[[Ionizing radiation]]\n*[[Particle accelerator]]\n*Rays:\n**[[gamma ray|\u03b3 (gamma) rays]]\n**[[neutron radiation|n (neutron) rays]]\n**[[delta ray|\u03b4 (delta) rays]]\n**[[epsilon ray|\u03b5 (epsilon) rays]]\n*[[Sterilisation (microbiology)]]\n*[[CRT screen]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* General Chemistry (structure and properties of matter) by Aruna Bandara (2010)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crtsite.com/page3.html The Cathode Ray Tube site]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt7ZWEDZ_GI Crookes tube with maltese cross operating]\n*[http://www.bigs.de/BLH/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=117&Itemid=293 The simulation show electrons in crossed fields] made by BIGS\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cathode Ray}}\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n[[Category:Electron beam]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]", "sha1": "myklhdeu97cn15954oh2qux1s63s7lk"}}, {"title": "Cathode", "ns": "0", "id": "6944", "revision": {"id": "865952962", "parentid": "864487129", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T07:59:06Z", "contributor": {"ip": "70.49.10.173"}, "comment": "I made the mnemonic device used more understandable by capitalizing each word.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\nA '''cathode''' is the [[electrode]] from which a [[conventional current]] leaves a polarized electrical device. This definition can be recalled by using the [[mnemonic]] ''CCD'' for ''Cathode Current Departs''. A conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move.  Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic ''cathode current departs'' also means that electrons flow ''into'' the device's cathode.\n\nThe electrode through which conventional current flows the other way, into the device, is termed an [[anode]].\n\n==Charge flow==\n[[Image:Copper cathode 2.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[copper]] cathode in a [[galvanic cell]] (e.g., a battery). Positively charged cations move towards the cathode allowing a positive current ''i'' to flow out of the cathode.]]\n\nThe flow of electrons is almost always from anode to cathode outside of the cell or device, regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode. An exception is in a [[diode]], where electrons flow from the cathode to the anode under a forward-bias.\n\nCathode [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] with respect to the [[anode]] can be positive or negative depending on how the device is being operated. Although positively charged [[ion|cations]] always move towards the cathode (hence their name) and negatively charged [[ion|anions]] move away from it, cathode polarity depends on the device type, and can even vary according to the operating mode. In a device which absorbs energy of charge (such as recharging a battery), the cathode is negative (electrons flow out of the cathode, and charge flows into it), and in a device which provides energy (such as battery in use), the cathode is positive (electrons flow into it and charge flows out):\nA battery or [[galvanic cell]] in use has a cathode that is the positive terminal since that is where the current flows out of the device. This outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the [[electrolyte]] to the positive cathode (chemical energy is responsible for this \"uphill\" motion). It is continued externally by electrons moving into the battery which constitutes positive current flowing outwards. For example, the [[Daniell cell|Daniell galvanic cell]]'s copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode.\nA battery that is recharging or an [[electrolytic cell]] performing electrolysis has its cathode as the negative terminal, from which current exits the device and returns to the external generator as charge enters the battery/ cell.  For example, reversing the current direction in a [[Daniell cell|Daniell galvanic cell]] converts it into an electrolytic cell<ref name=\"Reversed Daniell Cell\">[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrolyt.html#c1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604135153/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/Chemical/electrolyt.html |date=4 June 2011 }}, Daniell cell can be reversed to, technically, produce an electrolytic cell.</ref> where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and also the [[anode]].\nIn a [[diode]], the cathode is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol, where current flows out of the device. Note: electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows \"most easily\"), even for types such as [[Zener diode]]s or [[solar cell]]s where the current of interest is the reverse current.\nIn [[vacuum tube]]s (including [[cathode ray tube]]s) it is the negative terminal where electrons enter the device from the external circuit and proceed into the tube's near-vacuum, constituting a positive current flowing out of the device.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word was coined in 1834 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (''kathodos''), 'descent' or 'way down', by [[William Whewell]], who had been consulted<ref>Ross, S, ''Faraday Consults the Scholars: The Origins of the Terms of Electrochemistry'' in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London (1938\u20131996)'', Volume 16, Number 2 / 1961, Pages: 187\u2013220, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=y61755r466478481]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }} consulted 2006-12-22</ref> by [[Michael Faraday]] over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the \"decomposing body\" (electrolyte) in a direction \"from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move\", the cathode is where the current leaves the electrolyte, on the West side: \"''kata'' downwards, ''`odos'' a way ; the way which the sun sets\".<ref>Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity. Seventh Series, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (1776\u20131886)'', Volume 124, 1 January 1834, Page 77, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=526145013443q040]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }} consulted 2006-12-27 (in which Faraday introduces the words ''[[electrode]]'', ''[[anode]]'', ''cathode'', ''[[anion]]'', ''[[cation]]'', ''[[electrolyte]]'', ''[[electrolyze]]'')</ref><ref>Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity'', Volume 1, 1849, reprint of series 1 to 14, freely accessible Gutenberg.org transcript [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14986] consulted 2007-01-11</ref>\n\nThe use of 'West' to mean the 'out' direction (actually 'out' \u2192 'West' \u2192 'sunset' \u2192 'down', i.e. 'out of view') may appear unnecessarily contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term \"exode\" (the doorway where the current exits). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the West electrode' (other candidates had been \"westode\", \"occiode\" and \"dysiode\") was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for [[electric current|current]], whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical [[solenoid|magnetizing current loop]] around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic [[dipole]] field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the West electrode would not have been the 'way out' any more. Therefore, \"exode\" would have become inappropriate, whereas \"cathode\" meaning 'West electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode's function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the \"cathode\" term is based is subject to [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] whereas the [[electric current|current]] direction convention on which the \"exode\" term was based has no reason to change in the future.\n\nSince the later discovery of the [[electron]], an easier to remember, and more durably technically correct (although historically false), etymology has been suggested: cathode, from the Greek ''kathodos'', 'way down', 'the way (down) into the cell (or other device) for electrons'.\n\n==In chemistry==\nIn [[chemistry]], a '''cathode''' is the [[electrode]] of an [[electrochemical cell]] at which [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] occurs; a useful [[mnemonic]] to remember this is AnOx RedCat (Oxidation at the Anode = Reduction at the Cathode). [[List of chemistry mnemonics#Electrodes|Another mnemonic]] is to note the cathode has a 'c', as does 'reduction'. Hence, reduction at the cathode. Perhaps most useful would be to remember '''cat'''hode corresponds to '''cat'''ion (acceptor) and '''an'''ode corresponds to '''an'''ion (donor).  The cathode can be negative like when the cell is electrolytic (where electrical energy provided to the cell is being used for decomposing chemical compounds); or positive as when the cell is galvanic (where chemical reactions are used for generating electrical energy).  The cathode supplies electrons to the positively charged cations which flow to it from the electrolyte (even if the cell is galvanic, i.e., when the cathode is positive and therefore would be expected to repel the positively charged cations; this is due to [[electrode potential]] relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems in a [[galvanic cell]]).\n\nThe '''cathodic current''', in [[electrochemistry]], is the flow of [[electron]]s from the cathode interface to a species in solution.  The '''anodic current''' is the flow of electrons into the anode from a species in solution.\n\n===Electrolytic cell===\nIn an [[electrolytic cell]], the cathode is where the negative polarity is applied to drive the cell.  Common results of reduction at the cathode are hydrogen gas or pure metal from metal ions.  When discussing the relative reducing power of two redox agents, the couple for generating the more reducing species is said to be more \"cathodic\" with respect to the more easily reduced reagent.\n\n===Galvanic cell===\nIn a [[galvanic cell]], the cathode is where the positive [[Electrical polarity|pole]] is connected to allow the circuit to be completed: as the anode of the galvanic cell gives off electrons, they return from the circuit into the cell through the cathode.\n\n===Electroplating metal cathode (electrolysis)===\nWhen metal ions are reduced from ionic solution, they form a pure metal surface on the cathode.  Items to be plated with pure metal are attached to and become part of the cathode in the electrolytic solution.\n\n==In electronics==\n===Vacuum tubes===\n[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|Glow from the directly heated cathode of a 1 kW power [[tetrode]] tube in a radio transmitter.  The cathode filament is not directly visible]]\n\nIn a vacuum tube or electronic vacuum system, the cathode is a metal surface which emits free electrons into the evacuated space.  Since the electrons are attracted to the positive nuclei of the metal atoms, they normally stay inside the metal and require energy to leave it; this is called the ''[[work function]]'' of the metal.<ref name=\"Avadhanulu\">{{cite book\n |last        = Avadhanulu\n |first       = M.N.\n |author2     = P.G.

Before the advent of transistors in the 1960s, virtually all electronic equipment used hot-cathode [[vacuum tube]]s.  Today hot cathodes are used in vacuum tubes in radio transmitters and microwave ovens, to produce the electron beams in older [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) type televisions and computer monitors, in [[x-ray generator]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, and [[fluorescent tube]]s.\n\nThere are two types of hot cathodes:<ref name=\"Avadhanulu\" />\n* '''Directly heated cathode''': In this type, the filament itself is the cathode and emits the electrons directly.  Directly heated cathodes were used in the first vacuum tubes, but today they are only used in [[fluorescent tube]]s, some large transmitting vacuum tubes, and all X-ray tubes.\n* '''Indirectly heated cathode''': In this type, the filament is not the cathode but rather heats the cathode which then emits electrons.  Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most devices today.  For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube with the filament inside it, and the heat from the filament causes the outside surface of the tube to emit electrons.<ref name=\"Whitaker\" />   The filament of an indirectly heated cathode is usually called the ''heater''.   The main reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament.  Many vacuum tubes use [[alternating current]] to heat the filament.  In a tube in which the filament itself was the cathode, the alternating [[electric field]] from the filament surface would affect the movement of the electrons and introduce hum into the tube output.  It also allows the filaments in all the tubes in an electronic device to be tied together and supplied from the same current source, even though the cathodes they heat may be at different potentials.\n\nIn order to improve electron emission, cathodes are treated with chemicals, usually compounds of metals with a low [[work function]].  Treated cathodes require less surface area, lower temperatures and less power to supply the same cathode current.  The untreated tungsten filaments used in early tubes (called \"bright emitters\") had to be heated to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C (~2500&nbsp;\u00b0F), white-hot, to produce sufficient thermionic emission for use, while modern coated cathodes produce far more electrons at a given temperature so they only have to be heated to 425\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0C (~800\u20131100&nbsp;\u00b0F) ()<ref name=\"Avadhanulu\" /><ref name=\"IanPoole\">{{cite web\n |last        = Poole\n |first       = Ian\n |title       = Vacuum tube electrodes\n |work        = Vacuum Tube Theory Basics Tutorial\n |publisher   = Radio-Electronics.com, Adrio Communications\n |date        = 2012\n |url         = http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/thermionic-valves/vacuum-tube-theory/tube-electrodes.php\n |format      =\n |doi         =\n |accessdate  = 3 October 2013\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131104104630/http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/thermionic-valves/vacuum-tube-theory/tube-electrodes.php\n |archivedate = 4 November 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones\">{{cite book\n |last        = Jones\n |first       = Martin Hartley\n |title       = A Practical Introduction to Electronic Circuits\n |publisher   = Cambridge Univ.

They may emit electrons by [[field electron emission]], and in gas-filled tubes by [[secondary emission]].  Some examples are electrodes in [[neon light]]s, [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]s (CCFLs) used as backlights in laptops, [[thyratron]] tubes, and [[Crookes tube]]s.   They do not necessarily operate at room temperature; in some devices the cathode is heated by the electron current flowing through it to a temperature at which [[thermionic emission]] occurs.   For example, in some fluorescent tubes a momentary high voltage is applied to the electrodes to start the current through the tube; after starting the electrodes are heated enough by the current to keep emitting electrons to sustain the discharge.\n\nCold cathodes may also emit electrons by [[photoelectric emission]].  These are often called ''photocathodes'' and are used in [[phototube]]s used in scientific instruments and [[image intensifier]] tubes used in night vision goggles.\n\n===Diodes===\n[[Image:Diode symbol.svg|thumb|right]]\nIn a [[semiconductor device|semiconductor]] [[diode]], the cathode is the [[N\u2013doped]] layer of the [[PN junction]] with a high density of free electrons due to doping, and an equal density of fixed positive charges, which are the dopants that have been thermally ionized. In the anode, the converse applies: It features a high density of free \"holes\" and consequently fixed negative dopants which have captured an electron (hence the origin of the holes).\n\nWhen P and N-doped layers are created adjacent to each other, diffusion ensures that electrons flow from high to low density areas: That is, from the N to the P side. They leave behind the fixed positively charged dopants near the junction. Similarly, holes diffuse from P to N leaving behind fixed negative ionised dopants near the junction. These layers of fixed positive and negative charges are collectively known as the depletion layer because they are depleted of free electrons and holes. The depletion layer at the junction is at the origin of the diode's rectifying properties. This is due to the resulting internal field and corresponding potential barrier which inhibit current flow in reverse applied bias which increases the internal depletion layer field. Conversely, they allow it in forwards applied bias where the applied bias reduces the built in potential barrier.\n\nElectrons which diffuse from the cathode into the P-doped layer, or anode, become what are termed \"minority carriers\" and tend to recombine there with the majority carriers, which are holes, on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime. Similarly, holes diffusing into the N-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to recombine with electrons. In equilibrium, with no applied bias, thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and recombining, and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and recombining.\n\nLike a typical diode, there is a fixed anode and cathode in a Zener diode, but it will conduct current in the reverse direction (electrons flow from anode to cathode) if its breakdown voltage or \"Zener voltage\" is exceeded.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Battery (electricity)|Battery]]\n* [[Cathode bias]]\n* [[Electrolysis]]\n* [[Electrolytic cell]]\n* [[Gas-filled tube]]\n* [[Oxidation-reduction]]\n* [[Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)|PEDOT]]\n* [[Vacuum tube]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.crtsite.com The Cathode Ray Tube site]\n* [http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm How to define anode and cathode]\n\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Electrodes]]", "sha1": "pzzjhbxby3161cjwe06xa4leucw2uv2"}}, {"title": "Chrominance", "ns": "0", "id": "6945", "revision": {"id": "811424478", "parentid": "811424470", "timestamp": "2017-11-21T14:46:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/2405:205:6086:F262:E535:ABE1:8187:F8A6|2405:205:6086:F262:E535:ABE1:8187:F8A6]] to version by 172.251.77.75.

Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U&nbsp;=&nbsp;B\u2032&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;Y\u2032 (blue&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;luma) and V&nbsp;=&nbsp;R\u2032&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;Y\u2032 (red&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;luma).  Each of these difference components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard.  \n\nIn [[composite video]] signals, the U and V signals modulate a color [[subcarrier]] signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the [[hue]] and [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] of the color.  In digital-video and still-image [[color space]]s such as [[Y\u2032CbCr]], the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.\n\nSeparating [[RGB]] color signals into luma and chrominance allows the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of each to be determined separately.  Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by [[chroma subsampling]].\n\n==History==\nThe idea of transmitting a [[color television]] signal with distinct [[Luma (video)|luma]] and chrominance components originated with [[Georges Valensi]], who patented the idea in 1938.<ref>French patent 841335, issued Feb. 6, 1939; cited in U.S. Patent 2375966 [http://www.google.com/patents?id=dbhHAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&dq=ininventor:valensi+color+television#PPA20,M1 \"System of Television in Colors\"], issued May 15, 1945.</ref> Valensi's patent application described:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe use of two channels, one transmitting the predominating color (signal T), and the other the mean brilliance (signal t) output from a single television transmitter to be received not only by color television receivers provided with the necessary more expensive equipment, but also by the ordinary type of television receiver which is more numerous and less expensive and which reproduces the pictures in black and white only.\n</blockquote>\n\nPrevious schemes for color television systems, which were incompatible with existing monochrome receivers, transmitted [[RGB]] signals in various ways.\n\n==Television standards==\nIn [[analog television]], chrominance is encoded into a [[video signal]] using a [[subcarrier]] frequency. Depending on the video standard, the chrominance subcarrier may be either [[quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature-amplitude-modulated]] ([[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]) or [[frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] ([[SECAM]]).\n\nIn the PAL system, the color subcarrier is 4.43&nbsp;MHz above the video carrier, while in the NTSC system it is 3.58&nbsp;MHz above the video carrier. The NTSC and PAL standards are the most commonly used, although there are other video standards that employ different subcarrier frequencies. For example, [[PAL-M (television)|PAL-M]] (Brazil) uses a 3.58&nbsp;MHz subcarrier, and [[SECAM]] uses two different frequencies, 4.250&nbsp;MHz and 4.40625&nbsp;MHz above the video carrier.\n\nThe presence of chrominance in a video signal is indicated by a [[color burst]] signal transmitted on the [[back porch]], just after horizontal synchronization and before each line of video starts. If the color burst signal were visible on a television screen, it would appear as a vertical strip of a very dark olive color. In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]], hue is represented by a [[phase shift]]<!-- [[quadrature modulation]] --> of the chrominance signal relative to the color burst, while saturation is determined by the amplitude of the subcarrier. In [[SECAM]] (R\u2032&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;Y\u2032) and (B\u2032&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;Y\u2032) signals are transmitted alternately and phase does not matter.\n\nChrominance is represented by the [[YUV|U-V]] color plane in PAL and SECAM video signals, and by the [[YIQ|I-Q]] color plane in NTSC.\n\n==Digital systems==\nDigital video and digital still photography systems sometimes use a luma/chroma decomposition for improved compression.  For example, when an ordinary [[RGB]] digital image is compressed via the [[JPEG]] standard, the RGB colorspace is first converted (by a rotation [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) to a [[YCbCr]] colorspace, because the three components in that space have less correlation redundancy and because the chrominance components can then be subsampled by a factor of 2 or 4 to further compress the image.  On decompression, the Y\u2032CbCr space is rotated back to RGB.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Luma (video)]]\n* [[Chroma subsampling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Analogue TV transmitter topics}}\n{{Color topics}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]", "sha1": "0l9h4u4z3opvaf7yebmxrm69ylmu35y"}}, {"title": "Chirality (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "6946", "revision": {"id": "581523360", "parentid": "571220610", "timestamp": "2013-11-13T19:55:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "JHunterJ", "id": "842922"}, "comment": "Disambiguation page style repair ([[Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation|you can help!]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary|chirality}}\n'''[[Chirality]]''' (''handedness'') is a property of asymmetry.\n\n'''Chirality''' may also refer to:\n\n* [[Chirality (chemistry)]], a property of molecules having a non-superimposable mirror image\n* [[Chirality (electromagnetism)]], an electromagnetic propagation in chiral media\n* [[Chirality (mathematics)]], the property of a figure not being identical to its mirror image\n* [[Chirality (physics)]], when a phenomenon is not identical to its mirror image\n* [[Chirality (journal)|''Chirality'' (journal)]], an academic journal dealing with chiral chemistry\n* [[Chirality (manga)|''Chirality'' (manga)]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chirality in gastropods]]\n* [[Chiral knot]]\n* [[Handedness]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "85whichda23qq4tytnb4hq02htdjk9y"}}, {"title": "Campus", "ns": "0", "id": "6947", "revision": {"id": "856592880", "parentid": "856592866", "timestamp": "2018-08-26T09:13:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bdanh", "id": "19427696"}, "comment": "Undid revision 856592866 by [[Special:Contributions/Buileducanh|Buileducanh]] ([[User talk:Buileducanh|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n[[File:Joseph Ram\u00e9e Union College USA.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e]]'s original plan for [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the first comprehensively planned campus in the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Paul V. |year=1996 |title=Joseph Ram\u00e9e: International Architect of the Revolutionary Era |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=190}}</ref>]]\n\nA '''campus''' is traditionally the land on which a [[college]] or [[university]] and related institutional buildings are situated.

The whole assembly is called ''ji'', for it is just as ingenious as the loom.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=133}}|''[[Shiming]]''}}\n\n===European rolling nut lock===\nThe earliest European designs featured a transverse slot in the top surface of the frame, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out.  This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a ''tickler''.   A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a ''nut'' to retain the string.  This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal ''sear'' or trigger face, usually of metal.  These ''roller nuts'' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally.  Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.  Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little physical straining, allowing crossbowmen to aim better without fatiguing.<ref>Hanafi et al. 2011: 23</ref>\n\n===Bow===\nChinese crossbow bows were made of composite material from the start.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nEuropean crossbows from the 10th to 12th centuries used wood for the bow, also called the ''prod'' or ''lath'', which tended to be [[ash tree|ash]] or [[taxus|yew]].{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nComposite bows started appearing in Europe during the 13th century and could be made from layers of different material, often wood, horn, and sinew glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows made of several layers are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAs steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nTraditionally, the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording. This cording is called the ''[[bridle]]''.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n===Spanning mechanism===\nThe Chinese used winches for large mounted crossbows. Winches may have been used for hand held crossbows during the Han dynasty but there is only one known depiction of it. The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' mentions types of crossbows using winch mechanisms, but it's not known if these were handheld crossbows or mounted crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nDuring the medieval period, both Chinese and European crossbows used stirrups as well as belt hooks.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}} In the 13th century European crossbows started using winches, and from the 14th century an assortment of spanning mechanisms such as winch pulleys, cord pulleys, gaffles, cranequins, and even screws.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ixax|first1=belle|title=Crossbow Reviews 2017|url=http://thetagtech.com/best-crossbow-reviews|website=Archer's Caf\u00e9|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> \n\n<gallery>\nFile:Han brick tile showing a winched crossbow.jpg|[[Han dynasty]] crossbowman using what may be a winch drawn crossbow\nFile:Song dynasty crossbows.jpg|[[Song dynasty]] crossbows with stirrups\nFile:The Martyrdom of St Sebastian (detail).jpg|Fifteenth century crossbowman using a stirrup\nFile:Altarpiece of St Sebastian (detail).jpg|Fifteenth century crossbowman using a cranequin (rack & pinion)\nFile:HJRK A 2269 - Crossbow windlass, late 15th century.jpg|Iron cranequin, South German, late 15th century\nFile:Armborst 4, Nordisk familjebok.png|Twentieth century depiction of a [[windlass]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Variants ===\n[[File:Recurve crossbow with bolts.jpg|right|thumb|Modern recurve crossbow]]\n[[File:Horton Hunter Supreme by IvE.jpg|right|thumb|Modern compound crossbow]]\n[[File:HJRK A 108 - Wallarmbrust c. 1460-70.jpg|thumb|15th-century ''Wallarmbrust'', a heavy crossbow used for siege defense.]]\n\nThe smallest crossbows are pistol crossbows. Others are simple long stocks with the crossbow mounted on them. These could be shot from under the arm. The next step in development was stocks of the shape that would later be used [[Stock (firearms)|for firearms]], which allowed better aiming. The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow that required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses. For [[siege warfare]], the size of crossbows was further increased to hurl large projectiles, such as rocks, at fortifications. The required crossbows needed a massive base frame and powerful windlass devices. <ref>O'Connell, Robert L. (1989). ''Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression''.

These are much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. In ancient times, the bolts of a strong crossbow were usually several times heavier than arrows. Modern bolts are stamped with a proof mark to ensure their consistent weight. Bolts do not have [[fletching|fletch]]ing, i.e. feathered ends like those commonly seen on [[arrow]]s.<ref name=\"foremosthunting1\">[http://www.foremosthunting.com/Resources/Crossbows/BoltsandArrows/tabid/1087/Default.aspx Bolts and Arrows: The Lighter Side of Hunting Projectile Name Calling].

For example in one batch of slips there are only two mentions of bows, but thirty mentions of crossbows.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=141}} Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood stock and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name=\"peers 130 131\">Peers, 130\u2013131.</ref> Crossbows were used in numbers as large as 50,000 starting from the Qin dynasty and upwards of several hundred thousand during the Han.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=143}} According to one authority, the crossbow had become \"nothing less than the standard weapon of the Han armies,\" by the second century BC.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=22}} Han soldiers were required to pull a crossbow with a draw-weight of 76kg to qualify as a crossbowman.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nAfter the Han dynasty, the crossbow lost favor until it experienced a mild resurgence during the Tang dynasty, under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}} [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] and Li Quan prescribed 20 percent of the infantry to be armed with crossbows.{{sfn|Graff|2016|p=52}}\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the government attempted to restrict the spread of military crossbows and sought ways to keep armour and crossbows out of private homes.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=145}} Despite the ban on certain types of crossbows, the weapon experienced an upsurge in civilian usage as both a hunting weapon and pastime. The \"romantic young people from rich families, and others who had nothing particular to do\" formed crossbow shooting clubs as a way to pass time.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=146}}\n\nDuring the late [[Ming dynasty]], no crossbows were mentioned to have been produced in the three year period from 1619 to 1622.

During the Song dynasty, stirrups were added for ease of drawing and to mitigate damage to the bow. Alternatively the bow could also be drawn by a belt claw attached to the waist, but this was done lying down, as was the case for all large crossbows. Winch-drawing was used for the large mounted crossbows as seen below, but evidence for its use in Chinese hand-crossbows is scant.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=150}}\n\nOther sorts of crossbows also existed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, larger field artillery crossbows, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:Ref-chamballista.jpg|right|thumb|Wheelmounted and elephantmounted double-bow-arcuballistae of the [[Champa]] kingdom.]]\n\nIn [[Vietnam]]ese historical legend, general [[Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n]], who ruled over the ancient kingdom of [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] from 257 to 207&nbsp;BC, is said to have owed his power to a magic crossbow, capable of shooting thousands of bolts at once.\n\nThe native [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.

In his ''De Re Militaris'', he describes ''arcubalistarii'' (crossbowmen) working together with archers and artillerymen.{{sfn|Loades|2018}} However it is disputed if arcuballistas were even crossbows or just more torsion powered weapons. The idea that the arcuballista was a crossbow is based on the fact that Vegetius refers to it and the ''manuballista'', which was torsion powered, separately. Therefore if the arcuballista was not like the manuballista, it may have been a crossbow. Some suggest it was the other way around and manuballistas were crossbows.<ref>http://tastesofhistory.blogspot.com/2016/12/arcuballista-late-roman-crossbow.html</ref> The etymology is not clear and their definitions obscure. According to Vegetius, these were well known devices, and as such didn't make the effort to describe them in depth.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=172}}\n\n{{quotation|On the textual side, there is almost nothing but passing references in the military historian Vegetius (fl. + 386) to 'manuballistae' and 'arcuballistae' which he said he must decline to describe as they were so well known. His decision was highly regrettable, as no other author of the time makes any mention of them at all. Perhaps the best supposition is that the crossbow was primarily known in late European antiquity as a hunting weapon, and received only local use in certain units of the armies of Theodosius I, with\nwhich Vegetius happened to be acquainted.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=172}}|Joseph Needham}}\n\n[[Arrian]]'s earlier ''Ars Tactica'', written around 136 AD, does mention 'missiles shot not from a bow but from a machine' and that this machine was used on horseback while in full gallop. It's presumed that this was a crossbow.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\nThe only pictorial evidence of Roman arcuballistas comes from sculptural reliefs in [[Roman Gaul]] depicting them in hunting scenes. These are aesthetically similar to both the Greek and Chinese crossbows, but it's not clear what kind of release mechanism they used.

There is however a depiction of a crossbow as a hunting weapon on four [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval Scotland]] (6th to 9th centuries): [[St Vigeans|St. Vigeans no. 1]], [[Glenferness]], [[Shandwick]], and [[Meigle]].<ref>John M. Gilbert, ''Hunting and Hunting Reserves in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1979), p. 62.</ref> \n\nThe crossbow reappeared again in 947 as a French weapon during the siege of [[Senlis]] and again in 984 at the siege of [[Verdun]].{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=170}} They were used at the [[battle of Hastings]] in 1066 and by the 12th century it had become a common battlefield weapon.<ref name=\"Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey 1995 p. 48\">Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey (1995). \"The Book of the Crossbow\".

Later crossbows (sometimes referred to as [[arbalest]]s), utilizing all-steel prods, were able to achieve power close (and sometime superior) to longbows, but were more expensive to produce and slower to reload because they required the aid of mechanical devices such as the [[cranequin]] or [[windlass]] to draw back their extremely heavy bows. Usually these could only shoot two bolts per minute versus twelve or more with a skilled archer, often necessitating the use of a [[pavise]] to protect the operator from enemy fire.<ref name=\"Robert Hardy 1992 p. 75\">Robert Hardy (1992). \"Longbow: A Social and Military History\". Lyons & Burford. {{ISBN|1-85260-412-3}}, p. 75</ref> Along with [[Pole weapon|polearm]] weapons made from farming equipment, the crossbow was also a weapon of choice for insurgent peasants such as the [[Taborite]]s.

The [[Battle of Cerignola]] in 1503 was largely won by Spain through the use of matchlock firearms, marking the first time a major battle was won through the use of firearms. Later, similar competing tactics would feature [[arquebus|harquebusiers]] or [[musket]]eers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing [[pistol]]s or [[carbine]]s. While the military crossbow had largely been supplanted by firearms on the battlefield by 1525, the sporting crossbow in various forms remained a popular hunting weapon in Europe until the eighteenth century.<ref>Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey (1995). \"The Book of the Crossbow\". Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-28720-3}}, p. 48-53</ref>\n\n===Islamic world===\n\nThere are no references to crossbows in [[Islamic]] texts earlier than the 14th century. [[Arabs]] in general were averse to the crossbow and considered it a foreign weapon. They called it ''qaus al-rijl'' (foot-drawn bow), ''qaus al-zanb\u016brak'' (bolt bow) and ''qaus al-faranj\u012byah'' (Frankish bow). Although [[Muslims]] did have crossbows, there seems to be a split between eastern and western types. Muslims in [[Spain]] used the typical European trigger while eastern Muslim crossbows had a more complex trigger mechanism.{{sfn|Needham|1994|p=175}}\n\n[[Mamluk]] cavalry used crossbows.{{sfn|Loades|2018}}\n\n===Elsewhere===\nIn Western Africa and Central Africa,<ref>[http://www.photographersdirect.com/buyers/stockphoto.asp?imageid=348455 Baaka pygmy with crossbow].

Furthermore, the crossbow could hold the tension for a long time, whereas even the strongest longbowman could only hold a drawn bow for a short period of time. The ease of use of a crossbow allows it to be used effectively with little training, while other types of bows take far more skill to shoot accurately<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wideopenspaces.com/pros-cons-crossbow-hunting/|title=These Are The Pros and Cons of Crossbow Hunting|date=2016-09-01|work=Wide Open Spaces|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref>. The disadvantage is the greater weight and clumsiness compared to a bow, as well as the slower rate of shooting and the lower efficiency of the acceleration system, but there would be reduced [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], making the crossbow a more accurate weapon.\n\nCrossbows have a much smaller draw length than bows. This means that for the same energy to be imparted to the arrow (or bolt), the crossbow has to have a much higher draw weight.\n\nA direct comparison between a fast hand-drawn replica crossbow and a longbow show a 6:10 rate of shooting<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HagCuGXJgUs&feature=grec_index Video comparing longbow and crossbow] Retrieved 16 September 2010</ref> or a 4:9 rate within 30 seconds and comparable weapons.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g-0-RK3cjk longbow vs crossbow behind a pavese] Retrieved 16 September 2010</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main|Laws on crossbows}}\n[[File:Armbrustschiessen.jpg|thumb|right|Modern competition crossbow]]\nCan. 29 of the [[Second Lateran Council]] under [[Pope Innocent II]] in 1139 banned the use of crossbows, as well as slings and bows, against Christians.<ref>The sources are collected in Hefele, Histoire des conciles d'apres les documents originaux, trans. and continued by H.

[[Chalcedon]] was an [[Early centres of Christianity#Western Anatolia|early centre]] of Christianity located in [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]). The council was the fourth of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|Ecumenical Councils]] that are accepted by [[Chalcedonian]] churches which include the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and most [[Protestant]] churches. It was the first council not to be recognised by any [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] church; these churches may be classified as [[non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]].\n\nThe definition defines that Christ is \"acknowledged in two natures\", which \"come together into one person and one [[hypostatic union|hypostasis]]\". The formal definition of \"two natures\" in Christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time, and is understood by many historians and theologians today, to side with western and Antiochene [[Christology]] and to diverge from the teaching of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who always stressed that Christ is \"one\". However, a modern analysis of the sources of the creed (by A. de Halleux, in Revue Theologique de Louvain 7, 1976) and a reading of the acts, or proceedings, of the council (recently translated into English) show that the bishops considered Cyril the great authority and that even the language of \"two natures\" derives from him.\n\nRegarding the [[Person of Christ]] and the [[Hypostatic union]], Chalcedonian Creed affirmed the notion that Christ is \"One Person\", having \"One Hypostasis\". The christological notions of \"One Person\" (monoprosopic - having one ''[[prosopon]]'' / Greek term for ''person'') and \"One Hypostasis\" (monohypostatic - having one [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]]) were stated explicitly, in order to emphasize Council's anti-Nestorian positions.\n\n==Oriental Orthodox dissent==\nThe Chalcedonian Definition was written amid controversy between the [[Latin Church|Western]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]] over the meaning of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (see [[Christology]]), the ecclesiastical influence of the [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], and the supremacy of the Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The Western church readily accepted the creed, but some Eastern churches did not.\n\nIt became standard orthodox doctrine. However the [[Coptic Church of Alexandria]] dissented, holding to [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s preferred formula for the oneness of Christ's nature in the incarnation of God the Word as \"out of two natures\".<ref name=\"BG\">Bindley, T. Herbert & Green, F.&nbsp;W. ''The Oecumenical Documents of the Faith'' Methuen (1950) pp.&nbsp;91\u201392</ref> Cyril's language is not consistent and he may have countenanced the view that it is possible to contemplate in theory two natures after the incarnation,<ref name=\"BG\"/> but the Church of Alexandria felt that the Definition should have stated that Christ be acknowledged \"out of two natures\" rather than \"in two natures\".\n\nThis [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]] position, historically characterised by Chalcedonian followers as \"[[monophysitism]]\" though this is denied by the dissenters, formed the basis for the distinction from other churches of the Coptic Church of Egypt and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopia]] and the \"[[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]\" churches of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syria]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]).\n\n==English translation==\nIn one of the translations into English, the key section, emphasizing the double nature of Christ (human and divine), runs:<br>\n<blockquote>Following, then, the holy Fathers, we all unanimously teach that our Lord Jesus Christ is to us One and the same Son, the Self-same Perfect in Godhead, the Self-same Perfect in Manhood; ''truly God and truly Man''; the Self-same of a rational soul and body; co-essential with the Father according to the Godhead, the Self-same co-essential with us according to the Manhood; like us in all things, sin apart; before the ages begotten of the Father as to the Godhead, but in the last days, the Self-same, for us and for our salvation (born) of Mary the Virgin [[Theotokos]] as to the Manhood; One and the Same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten; acknowledged in Two Natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the difference of the Natures being in no way removed because of the Union, but rather the properties of each Nature being preserved, and (both) concurring into One Person and One Hypostasis; not as though He were parted or divided into Two Persons, but One and the Self-same Son and Only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as from the beginning the prophets have taught concerning Him, and as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself hath taught us, and as the Symbol of the Fathers hath handed down to us.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/MN41552ucmf_1/MN41552ucmf_1_djvu.txt</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe full text of the definition which reaffirms the decisions of the [[Council of Ephesus]], the pre-eminence of the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Nicaea]] (325) and the further definitions of the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] (381) can be found [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_XIV/The_Fourth_Ecumenical_Council/The_Definition_of_Faith here]   It also affirms the authority of two of [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s letters and the [[Tome of Leo]] written against [[Eutyches]] and sent to [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]] in 449.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|isbn=978-0-88-141056-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/chalcedon/chalcedonian_definition.shtml The Chalcedonian Creed in Greek at www.earlychurchtexts.com.] (with dictionary lookup links)\n*[http://creeds.net/ancient/chalcedon.htm Definition of Chalcedon]\n\n[[Category:5th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:Christian statements of faith]]\n[[Category:Christology]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]", "sha1": "g6c9cutl3thehfp24643ijal2tyvb40"}}, {"title": "Conservation law", "ns": "0", "id": "6956", "revision": {"id": "857996129", "parentid": "857995852", "timestamp": "2018-09-04T11:33:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "DVdm", "id": "262666"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/2405:204:5524:EEDC:BCD5:D7C7:40D2:D5C8|2405:204:5524:EEDC:BCD5:D7C7:40D2:D5C8]] ([[User talk:2405:204:5524:EEDC:BCD5:D7C7:40D2:D5C8|talk]]): nonconstructive edits ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|conservation in physics|the legal aspects of environmental conservation|Environmental law|and|Conservation movement|other uses|Conservation (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.\n\nA local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the \"transport\" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.\n\nFrom [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.\n\n==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==\n\nConservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.\n\nConservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.\n\nMost conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.\n\nOne particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.\n\n==Exact laws==\nA partial listing of physical conservation equations [[Symmetry (physics)#Conservation laws and symmetry|due to symmetry]] that are said to be '''exact laws''', or more precisely ''have never been proven to be violated:''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of \"global\" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.<ref name=\"Aitchison\">{{cite book\n |last1       = Aitchison\n |first1      = Ian J.

In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  \n\nA stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.<ref name=\"Aitchison\" /><ref name=\"Will\"/>  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.<ref name=\"Aitchison\" /><ref name=\"Will\"/>  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  \"flux\" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.\n\n==Differential forms==\n{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}\nIn continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u2207\u22c5 is the [[divergence]] operator, ''\u03c1'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.\n\nIf we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = \\rho \\mathbf{u} </math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) \\,.</math>\n\nIn one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:<ref name=\"To24\">see Toro, p.43</ref>\n\n:<math> y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 </math>\n\nwhere the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:\n\n:<math> y_t + A(y) y_x = s </math>\n\nis not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].\n\nIn the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:\n\n:<math> y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 </math>\n\nwhere the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':<ref name=\"To24\" />\n\n:<math> a(y) = j_y (y)</math>\n\nIn this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:\n\n:<math> j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x </math>\n\nthe conservation equation can be put into the current density form:\n\n:<math> y_t + j_x (y)= 0 </math>\n\nIn a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:\n\n:<math> y_t + \\mathbf a(y) \\cdot \\nabla y = 0 </math>\n\nwhere the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''<math>\\cdot</math>'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q.

It was hosted by brothers [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]], known also as \"Click and Clack, the [[Tappet#Internal combustion engines|Tappet]] Brothers\".  \n\nThe show was produced from 1977 to October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired.

Most of the advice sought was diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis made an attempt to identify the malfunction over the telephone and give advice on how to fix it. While the hosts peppered their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis. However, when they were stumped, they attempted anyway with an answer they claimed was \"unencumbered by the thought process\", the official motto of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.npr.org/wear/clothing/car-talk-unencumbered-latin-t-shirt |title=NPR Store Unencumbered by the thought process |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912074149/http://shop.npr.org/wear/clothing/car-talk-unencumbered-latin-t-shirt |archivedate=September 12, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nEdited reruns are carried on [[XM Satellite Radio]] via both the Public Radio and NPR Now channels.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.siriusxm.com/siriusxmpublicradio/weeklyschedule | title=Sirius XM's Public Radio Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.siriusxm.com/nprnow/weeklyschedule | title=Sirius XM's NPR Now Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NPR's Car Talk Listeners Pick Ugliest New Car|url=https://www.npr.org/about/press/050409.uglycar.html |quote=Car Talk is public radio's most popular entertainment program, airing on nearly 600 stations with more than 4.4 million listeners a week tuning in for an hour-long tune-up on car advice and humor.|work=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] | year=2005 | accessdate=2010-12-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NPR Programs Attract Record-Breaking Audiences Public Radio Listenership at All-Time High |url=https://www.npr.org/about/press/020319.recordbreak.html|quote=Growth in the NPR news/talk audience outpaced similar gains realized by commercial news/talk radio. | work=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] | year=2002 | accessdate=2008-12-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Car Talk'' [[theme music]] was \"Dawggy Mountain Breakdown\" by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist [[David Grisman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-4|title=Music on the Show}}</ref>\n\n===Call-in procedure===\nThroughout the program, listeners were encouraged to dial the [[toll-free telephone number]], 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connected to a 24-hour answering service.

After the shift to the three-segment format, it became a running joke to refer to the last segment as \"the third half\" of the program.\n\nThe show opened with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts ran a contest called the \"Puzzler\", in which a riddle, sometimes car-related, was presented. The answer to the previous week's \"Puzzler\" was given at the beginning of the \"second half\" of the show, and a new \"Puzzler\" was given at the start of the \"third half\". The hosts gave instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to \"Puzzler Tower\" on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a \"$26 bill\" or an advanced digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera. This gag initially started as suggestions that the answers be written \"on the back of a $20 bill\". A [[running gag]] concerned Tom's inability to remember the previous week's \"Puzzler\" without heavy prompting from Ray. For each puzzler, one correct answer was chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the ''Car Talk'' store, referred to as the \"Shameless Commerce Division\".<ref>[http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/ \"Puzzler\"], ''Car Talk'' website</ref>  It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years. Originally, the winner received a specific item from the store, but it soon changed to a gift certificate to allow the winner to choose the item they wanted (though Tom often made an item suggestion).\n\nA recurring feature was \"Stump the Chumps,\" in which the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, \"Where Are They Now, Tommy?\"  It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop.  Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of the essence of the previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream.  The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff.  The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn't start) if the diagnosis was wrong.  The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.\n\nThe brothers also had an official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru named Kieran Lindsey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.vt.edu/search/person.html?person=1376104 |title=Kieran Lindsey - People Search &#124; Virginia Tech |work=Search.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09|quote=Kieran Jane Lindsey; Director, Natural Resources Distance Learning Corsortium, College of Natural Resources & Env.}}</ref> She answered questions like ''How do I remove a snake from my car?'' and offered advice on how those living in cities and suburbs could reconnect with wildlife.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://withgoodreasonradio.org/2011/10/girl-scouts-beyond-campfires-and-cookie/ |title=Girl Scouts: Beyond Campfires and Cookies |publisher=[[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities]] |date=October 29, 2011 |quote=Answering questions like how to remove a snake from your car, urban wildlife biologist Kieran Lindsey (Virginia Tech) is the new official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru for Car Talk on NPR.

Grunsfeld]] calling from the [[Space Shuttle]]. There were numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including [[Bob Edwards]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Scott Simon]], [[Ray Suarez]], [[Will Shortz]], [[Sylvia Poggioli]], and commentator and author [[Daniel Pinkwater]]. On one occasion, the show featured [[Martha Stewart]] as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as \"Margaret\".\n\nIn addition to at least one on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing an electric car.  When they asked what kind of car, the caller stated it was a \"kit car\", a $400 million \"kit car\". It was a joke call from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] concerning the preparation of the [[Mars rover]] for the oncoming Martian winter.<ref>[http://www.cartalk.com/content/winter-driving-tips-mars Blog Post | Winter Driving Tips.

Tom and Ray are known for their [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]], often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice and the show in general. They also commented at the end of each show: \"Well, it's happened again\u2014you've wasted another perfectly good hour listening to ''Car Talk''.\"\n\nAt some point in almost every show, usually when giving the address for the Puzzler answers or fan mail, Ray mentioned [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (where the show originated), at which point Tom reverently interjected with a tone of civic pride, \"Our fair city\". Ray invariably mocked \"'Cambridge, MA', the United States Postal Service's two-letter abbreviation for 'Massachusetts\"', by pronouncing the \"MA\" as a word.\n\nPreceding each break in the show, one of the hosts led up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification.  The full line went along the pattern of, for example, \"And even though [[Roger Clemens#SteroidUseControversy|Roger Clemens]] stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears ''us'' say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio\" (later just \"...&nbsp;this is NPR\").\n\nAt one point in the show, often after the break, Ray usually stated that: \"Support for this show is provided by,\" followed by an absurd fundraiser.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe ending credits of the show started with thanks to the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers: producer Doug \"the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman\" Berman;<ref>{{cite news| url=http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2018445674_edit17talk.html| title=Tom and Ray, the Tappet Brothers, are exhausted| date=2012-06-16| publisher=The Seattle Times| accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> \"John 'Bugsy' Lawlor, just back from the&nbsp;...\" every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names; David \"Calves of Belleville\" Greene;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-0|title=Music on the Show |publisher=cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> Catherine \"[[Young Frankenstein|Frau Bl\u00fccher]]\" Fenollosa, whose name caused a horse to neigh and gallop (an allusion to a running gag in the movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'');<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/help-us-help-henry-2010-1 |title=Help Us Help Henry 2010 |publisher=cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713071358/http://www.cartalk.com/content/help-us-help-henry-2010-1 |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}</ref> and Carly \"High Voltage\" Nix,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/whos-real-high-voltage-car-talk-plaza |title=Who's the real \"High Voltage\" at Car Talk Plaza?| last= Nix |first= Carly| publisher= cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> among others.

The council is numbered as the fourth [[ecumenical council]] by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and most [[Protestantism|Protestants]]. [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] Churches do not agree with the conduct and the proceedings of the Council, commonly calling it \"Chalcedon, the Ominous\". Several Oriental Orthodox Church historians have viewed the Council as a power dispute by the Church of Rome of having special patriarchal status among other Churches. The Oriental Orthodox Churches have seen this as the key factor contributing to the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe [[Copts]] consistently repudiate the Western identification of Alexandrine Christianity with the [[Eutychianism]] which originated in Constantinople and which they have always regarded as a flagrant heresy ([[monophysitism]]) since it declared the complete absorption of Christ's manhood in his single divine nature whereas the Copts clearly upheld the doctrine of the two natures, divine and human - mystically united in one ([[miaphysitism]]) without confusion, corruption or change. As a strictly traditional church, its religious leaders have sought biblical justification for this interpretation of the Nicean Creed and the Cyriliian formula, but meanwhile have restricted the substance of their variance to interpretation. Those who can read the Coptic sources<ref>The Christological Teaching of the Non-Chalcedonian Churches, Wahib A. Girgis</ref><ref>The Age of Ecumenical Councils, ArchBishop Basileus of Jerusalem</ref> both in Coptic and in Arabic, rather than study their doctrinal outlook through secondary works by members of the opposite camp (i.e. the Western Churches) are left wondering whether political and ecclesiastical authority was not behind the unnatural exaggeration of existing differences between the two professions....That the East, or more precisely, the Alexandrine Fathers of the Coptic Church, had led the way in the first three crucial ecumenical councils, seems to be a foregone conclusion which needs no elaboration. That a fourth meeting, at Ephesus, should again be dominated by the Coptic element appeared to strike a note of alarm in the imperial cities of Rome and Constantinople. The subsequent fury of the West over the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was demonstrated in its rather impulsive description of it as a \"robber council\".<ref>History of Eastern Christianity, Aziz S. Atiya</ref>\n\nFollowers of the Council believe its most important achievement was to issue the [[Chalcedonian Definition]], stating that Jesus is \"perfect both in deity and in humanness; this selfsame one is also actually God and actually man.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.creeds.net/ancient/chalcedon.htm |title=Definition of Chalcedon |website=Creeds.net |access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref> The council's judgments and definitions regarding the divine marked a significant turning point in the [[Christological]] debates.<ref>{{cite book|title=The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon|author1=Richard Price|author2=Michael Gaddis|date=2006|isbn=0-85323-039-0 |pages=1\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=PA94|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2016-11-01}}</ref>\n\nChalcedon was a city in [[Bithynia]], on the Asian side of the [[Bosphorus]]; today the city is part of the [[Republic of Turkey]] and is known as [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] (a district of [[Istanbul]]).\n\n==Background==\nThe Council of Chalcedon was convened by [[Emperor Marcian]], with the reluctant approval of [[Pope Leo the Great]], to set aside the 449 [[Second Council of Ephesus]] which was named the \"Latrocinium\"<ref>Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). \"''Latrocinium''\". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref>  or \"Robber Council\" by Pope Leo. The Council of Chalcedon issued the [[Chalcedonian Definition]], which repudiated the notion of a single nature in Christ, and declared that he has two natures in one person and [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]. It also insisted on the completeness of his two natures: [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] and manhood.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=167-178}} The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons governing church administration and authority. In a further decree, later known as canon 28, the bishops declared that the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|See of Constantinople]] (New Rome) had the patriarchal status second to the [[Holy See|See of Rome]].<ref>Schwerin, Philip, [http://essays.wls.wels.net/bitstream/handle/123456789/3512/SchwerinBishop.pdf How the Bishop of Rome Assumed the Title of \"Vicar of Christ\"], p3, \"Leo believed that in him was the voice of Peter. The Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451 declared that Constantinople had the same patriarchal status as Rome (28th canon), a statement with which Leo never agreed, and which he even tried to declare invalid. When Leo tried to reinstate a defrocked French bishop, St. Hilary who presided over the Gallican Church as Supreme Pontiff, told Leo to keep his Roman nose out of French affairs.

This was reaffirmed at the [[First Council of Constantinople (381)]] and the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).\n\nAfter the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] had condemned [[Nestorianism]], there remained a conflict between [[Patriarch]]s [[John of Antioch]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. Cyril claimed that John remained Nestorian in outlook, while John claimed that Cyril held to the [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarian]] heresy. The two settled their differences under the mediation of the Bishop of Beroea, [[Acacius of Beroea|Acacius]], on April 12, 433. In the following year, [[Theodoret]] of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus]] assented to this formula as well. He agreed to anathematize Nestorius as a heretic in 451, during the Council of Chalcedon, as the price to be paid for being restored to his see (after deposition at the Council of Ephesus of 449). This put a final end to Nestorianism within the Roman Empire.\n\n===Eutychian controversy===\nAbout two years after [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s death in 444, an aged [[monk]] from Constantinople named [[Eutyches]] began teaching a subtle variation on the traditional [[Christology]] in an attempt (as he described in a letter to [[Pope Leo I]] in 448) to stop a new outbreak of [[Nestorianism]]. He claimed to be a faithful follower of Cyril's teaching, which was declared orthodox in the Union of 433.\n\nCyril had taught that \"There is only one ''physis'', since it is the Incarnation, of God the Word.\" Cyril had apparently understood the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word ''physis'' to mean approximately what the [[Latin]] word ''persona'' (person) means, while most Greek theologians would have interpreted that word to mean ''natura'' (nature). Thus, many understood Eutyches to be advocating [[Docetism]], a sort of reversal of [[Arianism]]\u2014where Arius had denied the [[consubstantial]] divinity of [[Jesus]], Eutyches seemed to be denying his human nature.{{clarify|reason=Rather, this is how Pope Leo misread him|date=January 2012}} Cyril's orthodoxy was not called into question, since the Union of 433 had explicitly spoken of two ''physeis'' in this context. {{clarify|reason=it spoke of a 'union of two natures,' but this did not make plain that one had to speak of two natures AFTER the union|date=July 2012}}\n\nLeo I wrote that Eutyches' error seemed to be more from a lack of skill on the matters than from malice. Further, his side of the controversy tended not to enter into arguments with their opponents, which prevented the misunderstanding from being uncovered. Nonetheless, due to the high regard in which Eutyches was held (second only to the Patriarch of Constantinople in the East), his teaching spread rapidly throughout the East. {{clarify|reason=he was not a teacher, and was never referred to as an authority; the issue was which writings by Cyril of Alexandria had authority|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn November 448, during a local [[synod]] in Constantinople, Eutyches was denounced as a heretic by the Bishop [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]]. Eusebius demanded that Eutyches be removed from office. Patriarch [[Flavian of Constantinople]] preferred not to press the matter on account of Eutyches' great popularity. He finally relented and Eutyches was condemned as a heretic by the synod.  However, the Emperor [[Theodosius II]] and [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria]], rejected this decision ostensibly because Eutyches had repented and confessed his orthodoxy.{{clarify|reason=no one claimed that Eutyches had 'repented'|date=July 2012}} Dioscorus then held his own synod which reinstated Eutyches. The competing claims between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria led the Emperor to call a council which was held in [[Ephesus]] in 449. The emperor invited [[Pope Leo I]] to preside.{{clarify|reason=he did not!|date=January 2012}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=Philip|title=A Popular History of the Catholic Church|publisher=Image Books (Doubleday)|year=1954|location=Garden City, New York|page=37}}</ref> He declined to attend on account of the invasion of Italy by [[Attila the Hun]]. However, he agreed to send four legates to represent him. Leo provided his legates, one of whom died en route, with a letter addressed to Flavian of Constantinople explaining Rome's position in the controversy. Leo's letter, now known as [[Leo's Tome]], confessed that Christ had two natures, and was not of or from two natures.<ref name=SevenCouncils>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-59.htm#P3825_663549 |title=NPNF2-14.

In particular, the third anathema reads: \"If anyone divides in the one Christ the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]] after the union, joining them only by a conjunction of dignity or authority or power, and not rather by a coming together in a union by nature, let him be anathema.\" This appeared to some to be incompatible with Leo's definition of two natures hypostatically joined. However, the council would determine (with the exception of 13 Egyptian bishops) that this was an issue of wording and not of doctrine; a committee of bishops appointed to study the orthodoxy of the Tome using Cyril's letters (which included the twelve anathemas) as their criteria unanimously determined it to be orthodox, and the council, with few exceptions, supported this.{{clarify|reason=this is garbled, and what council is being talked about?|date=July 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm#m7 |title=Orthodox And Oriental Orthodox Consultation |website=Romanity.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}</ref>\n\n==\"Latrocinium\" of Ephesus==\nOn August 8, 449 the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] began its first session with Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria presiding by command of the Emperor. Dioscorus began the council by banning all members of the November 447 synod which had deposed Eutyches. He then introduced [[Eutyches]] who publicly professed that while Christ had two natures before the incarnation, the two natures had merged to form a single nature after the incarnation. Of the 130 assembled bishops, 111 voted to rehabilitate Eutyches. Throughout these proceedings, [[Pope Hilarius|Hilary]] (one of the papal legates) repeatedly called for the reading of Leo's Tome, but was ignored. Dioscorus then moved to depose [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]] and Eusebius of Dorylaeum on the grounds that they taught the Word had been made flesh and not just assumed flesh from the Virgin and that Christ had two natures. When Flavian and Hilary objected, Dioscorus called for a pro-monophysite mob to enter the church and assault Flavian as he clung to the altar. Flavian was mortally wounded. Dioscorus then placed Eusebius of Dorylaeum under arrest and demanded the assembled bishops approve his actions. Fearing the mob, they all did. The papal legates refused to attend the second session at which several more orthodox bishops were deposed, including Ibas of Edessa, Irenaeus of Tyre (a close personal friend of Nestorius), Domnus of Antioch, and Theodoret.

Pope Dioscorus requested deferring reading of Leo's Tome, as it was not seen as necessary to start with, and could be read later. This was seen as a rebuke to the representatives from the Church of Rome not reading the Tome from the start. The claims of the bishops being forced to approve actions, were challenged by Pope Dioscorus and the Egyptian Bishops at Chalcedon, to which the{{clarify|unfinished sentence|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Convocation and session==\nThe situation continued to deteriorate, with Leo demanding the convocation of a new council and Emperor Theodosius II refusing to budge, all the while appointing bishops in agreement with Dioscorus. All this changed dramatically with the Emperor's death and the elevation of [[Marcian]], an orthodox Christian, to the imperial throne. To resolve the simmering tensions, Marcian announced his intention to hold a new council. Leo had pressed for it to take place in [[Italy]], but Emperor Marcian instead called for it to convene at [[\u0130znik|Nicaea]]. Hunnish invasions forced it to move at the last moment to [[Chalcedon]], where the council opened on October 8, 451. Marcian had the bishops deposed by Dioscorus returned to their dioceses and had the body of Flavian brought to the capital to be buried honorably.\n\nThe Emperor asked Leo to preside over the council, but Leo again chose to send legates in his place. This time, Bishops Paschasinus of Lilybaeum and Julian of Cos and two priests Boniface and Basil represented the western church at the council. The Council of Chalcedon condemned the work of the Robber Council and professed the doctrine of the Incarnation presented in Leo's Tome.{{clarify|reason=a tendentious claim: the council attached more authority to Cyril of Alexandria's Second Letter to Nestorius|date=January 2012}} The council was attended by about 520 bishops or their representatives and was the largest and best-documented of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils#The Councils|first seven ecumenical councils]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Council-of-Chalcedon |title=Council of Chalcedon &#124; Christianity |website=Britannica.com |date=1955-04-15 |accessdate=2016-11-01}}</ref> Paschasinus refused to give Dioscorus (who had [[excommunicated]] Leo leading up to the council) a seat at the council. As a result, he was moved to the nave of the church. Paschasinus further ordered the reinstatement of Theodoret and that he be given a seat, but this move caused such an uproar among the council fathers, that Theodoret also sat in the nave, though he was given a vote in the proceedings, which began with a trial of Dioscorus.\n\nMarcian wished to bring proceedings to a speedy end, and asked the council to make a pronouncement on the doctrine of the Incarnation before continuing the trial. The council fathers, however, felt that no new creed was necessary, and that the doctrine had been laid out clearly in Leo's Tome.<ref name=SevenCouncils /> They were also hesitant to write a new creed as the Council of Ephesus had forbidden the composition or use of any new creed. The second session of the council ended with shouts from the bishops, \"It is [[Saint Peter|Peter]] who says this through Leo. This is what we all of us believe. This is the faith of the Apostles. Leo and Cyril teach the same thing.\" However, during the reading of Leo's Tome, three passages were challenged as being potentially Nestorian, and their orthodoxy was defended by using the writings of Cyril.<ref name=\"romanity.org\">{{cite journal|author=Fr.

A number of other bishops also entered statements to the effect that they believed that Leo's Tome was not in contradiction with the teaching of Cyril as well.<ref name=\"romanity.org\"/>\n\nThe council continued with Dioscorus' trial, but he refused to appear before the assembly. However, historical accounts from the Eastern Orthodox Church note that Pope Dioscorus was put under solitary arrest. As a result, he was condemned, but by an underwhelming amount (more than half the bishops present for the previous sessions did not attend his condemnation), and all of his decrees were declared null. Empress Pulcheria (Marcian's wife) told Dioscorus \"In my father's time, there was a man who was stubborn (referring to St. John Chrysostom) and you are aware of what was made of him\", to which Dioscorus famously responded \"And you may recall that your mother prayed at his tomb, as she was bleeding of sickness\". Pulcheria is said to have slapped Dioscorus in the face, breaking some of his teeth, and ordered the guards to confine him, which they did pulling his beard hair. Pope Dioscorus is said to have put these in a box and sent them back to his Church in Alexandria noting \"this is the fruit of my faith\"<ref>History of the Coptic Church, Father Menassa Yo7anna</ref><ref>The Coptic Church, Orthodox and Spiritual, Father Tadros Yacoub Malaty</ref>. Marcian responded by exiling Dioscorus. All of the bishops were then asked to sign their assent to the Tome, but a group of thirteen Egyptians refused, saying that they would assent to \"the traditional faith\". As a result, the Emperor's commissioners decided that a ''credo'' would indeed be necessary and presented a text to the fathers. No consensus was reached, and indeed the text has not survived to the present. Paschasinus threatened to return to Rome to reassemble the council in Italy. Marcian agreed, saying that if a clause were not added to the ''credo'' supporting Leo's doctrine {{clarify|reason=Marcian made no mention of Leo|date=July 2012}}, the bishops would have to relocate. The bishops relented and added a clause, saying that, according to the decision of Leo, in Christ there are two natures united, inconvertible, inseparable.{{clarify|reason=this misrepresents both the extent and the details of the revision, and it was Cyril not Leo who was said to have provided the correct exposition of the Nicene Creed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Confession of Chalcedon===\n{{Main article|Chalcedonian Definition}}\nThe Confession of Chalcedon provides a clear statement on the two natures of Christ, human and divine:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/chalcedon/chalcedonian_definition.shtml |title=Chalcedonian Definition |website=Earlychurchtexts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach people to confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a reasonable [rational] soul and body; consubstantial [co-essential] with the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; (\u1f10\u03bd \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2, \u1f00\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2, \u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2, \u1f00\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u2013 ''in duabus naturis inconfuse, immutabiliter, indivise, inseparabiliter'') the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, and concurring in one Person (''prosopon'') and one Subsistence (''hypostasis''), not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten God (\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u1fc6 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03bd), the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the beginning [have declared] concerning Him, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself has taught us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.}}\n\nThe full text of the definition which reaffirms the decisions of the [[Council of Ephesus]], the pre-eminence of the [[Nicene Creed|Creed of Nicea]] (325) and the further definitions of the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] (381) can be found here <ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_XIV/The_Fourth_Ecumenical_Council/The_Definition_of_Faith |title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XIV/The Fourth Ecumenical Council/The Definition of Faith - Wikisource, the free online library |website=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}</ref>  It also canonises as authoritative two of [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s letters and the [[Tome of Leo]] written against [[Eutyches]] and sent to [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]] in 449.\n\n===Canons===\nThe work of the council was completed by a series of 30 disciplinary [[canon law|canons]] the Ancient [[Epitome]]s of which are:<ref name=SevenCouncils />\n# The canons of every Synod of the holy Fathers shall be observed.\n# Whoso buys or sells an ordination, down to a Prosmonarius, shall be in danger of losing his grade.

At the time, the See of Constantinople was not yet of ecclesiastical prominence, but its proximity to the Imperial court gave rise to its importance. The Council of Constantinople in 381 modified the situation somewhat by placing Constantinople second in honor, above Alexandria and Antioch, stating in Canon III, that \"the bishop of Constantinople... shall have the prerogative of honor after the bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome\". In the early 5th century, this status was challenged by the bishops of Alexandria, but the Council of Chalcedon confirmed in Canon XXVIII:\n{{quote|For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city.  And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges (\u1f34\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1) to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her.<ref name=SevenCouncils />}}\n\nIn making their case, the council fathers argued that tradition had accorded \"honor\" to the see of older Rome because it was the first imperial city. Accordingly, \"moved by the same purposes\" the fathers \"apportioned equal prerogatives to the most holy see of new Rome\" because \"the city which is honored by the imperial power and senate and enjoying privileges equaling older imperial Rome should also be elevated to her level in ecclesiastical affairs and take second place after her\".<ref>''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils'', ed. Norman P. Tanner, SJ, 99\u2013100.</ref>  The framework for allocating ecclesiastical authority advocated by the council fathers mirrored the allocation of imperial authority in the later period of the [[Roman Empire]]. The Eastern position could be characterized as being political in nature, as opposed to a doctrinal view. In practice, all Christians East and West addressed the papacy as the See of Peter and Paul or the Apostolic See rather than the See of the Imperial Capital. Rome understands this to indicate that its precedence has always come from its direct lineage from the apostles Peter and Paul rather than its association with Imperial authority.{{clarify|reason=The debate was not over Roman primacy, or the grounds for it, for over primacy in the East: Constantinople was now given primacy over Alexandria and Antioch, and this could only be done on the basis of its status as the imperial capital. Rome objected because it saw the demotion of Alexandria and Antioch as uncanonical|date=January 2012}}\n\nAfter the passage of the Canon 28, Rome filed a protest against the reduction of honor given to Antioch and Alexandria. However, fearing  that withholding Rome's approval would be interpreted as a rejection of the entire council, in 453 the pope confirmed the council's canons with a protest against the 28th.\n\n==Consequences: Chalcedonian Schism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Nestorianism]] -->\nThe near-immediate result of the council was a major schism.{{clarify|reason=it was not 'near-immediate': there was certainly opposition to the council, but schism, in the sense of a rival episcopal hierarchy, distinct from that of the imperial church, only began to develop in the mid-sixth century, and only became complete after the Arab conquest of Syria and Egypt|date=January 2012}} The bishops that were uneasy with the language of Pope Leo's Tome repudiated the council, saying that the acceptance of two ''physes'' was tantamount to Nestorianism.

This must be regarded as the outward expression of the growing nationalist trends in that province against the gradual intensification of Byzantine imperialism, soon to reach its consummation during the reign of Emperor Justinian.\nA significant effect on the Orthodox Christians in Egypt, was a series of persecutions by the Roman (later, Byzantine) empire forcing followers of the Eastern Orthodox Church to claim allegiance to Leo's Tome, or Chalcedon. This led to the martyrdom, persecution and death of thousands of Egyptian saints and bishops till the Arab Conquest of Egypt<ref>The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion, Alfred Joshua Butler</ref>. As a result, The Council of Chalcedon is referred to as \"Chalcedon, the Omnious\" among Coptic Egyptians given how it led to Christians persecuting other Christians for the first time in history. Until today, Coptic Orthodox Christians distinct themselves from followers of Chalcedon. Although the theological differences are seen as limited (if non-existent), it is politics, the subsequent persecutions and the power struggles of a rising Roman Empire that may have led to the Great Schism, or at least contributed significantly to amplifying it through the centuries.\n\n[[Justinian I]] attempted to bring those monks who still rejected the decision of the Council of Chalcedon into communion with the greater church. The exact time of this event is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 535 and 548. [[Abraham (Copt)|St Abraham of Farshut]] was summoned to Constantinople and he chose to bring with him four monks. Upon arrival, Justinian summoned them and informed them that they would either accept the decision of the council or lose their positions. Abraham refused to entertain the idea.

(Of those clubs, only the Toronto club is still in continuous operation today.)\n\nThis rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's [[McGill University]].

The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks.

The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game was played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums.\n\nThe [[Grey Cup]] was established in 1909 after being donated by [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], The Governor General of Canada as the championship of teams under the CRU for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada.<ref name=\"cfl.ca\" /> Initially an amateur competition, it eventually became dominated by professional teams in the 1940s and early 1950s. The [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], the last amateur organization to compete for the trophy, withdrew from competition in 1954. The move ushered in the modern era of Canadian professional football, culminating in the formation of the present-day [[Canadian Football League]] in 1958.\n\nCanadian football has mostly been confined to Canada, with the United States being the only other country to have hosted high-level Canadian football games. The CFL's controversial \"[[Canadian Football League in the United States|South Division]]\" as it would come to be officially known attempted to put CFL teams in the United States playing under Canadian rules between 1992 and 1995. The move was aborted after three years; the [[Baltimore Stallions]] were the most successful of the numerous Americans teams to play in the CFL, winning the [[83rd Grey Cup]]. Continuing financial losses, a lack of proper Canadian football venues, a pervasive belief that the American teams were simply pawns to provide the struggling Canadian teams with expansion fee revenue, and the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|return of the NFL to Baltimore]] prompted the end of Canadian football on the American side of the border.\n\nThe CFL hosted the [[Touchdown Atlantic]] regular season game at Nova Scotia in 2005 and New Brunswick in 2010, 2011 and 2013. In 2013, Newfoundland and Labrador became the last province to establish football at the minor league level, with teams playing on the Avalon Peninsula and in Labrador City.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The province however has yet to host a college or CFL game. [[Prince Edward Island]], the smallest of the provinces, has also never hosted a CFL game.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Ottawa and Hamilton Tigers football game 5.jpg|A game between the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats|Hamilton Tigers]] and the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], 1910\nFile:Football game between the 4th Canadian Armoured Division Atoms and the 1st Canadian Army Red and Blue Bombers.jpg|A game between the [[4th Canadian Armoured Division]] Atoms and [[First Canadian Army]] Red and Blue Bombers, in [[Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]], October 1945\nFile:Statue touchdown cfhof.jpg|''Touchdown'' monument outside the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]\n</gallery>\n\n== League play ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:CFL footballs and helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Footballs and a helmet at a [[Calgary Stampeders]] ([[Canadian Football League|CFL]]) team practice]]\nCanadian football is played at several levels in Canada; the top league is the professional nine-team [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs for the [[Grey Cup]] are completed by mid-November. In cities with outdoor stadiums such as [[Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.\n\nAmateur football is governed by [[Football Canada]]. At the university level, 26 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of [[U Sports]] (known from 2001\u20132016 as Canadian Interuniversity Sport); the U Sports champion is awarded the [[Vanier Cup]]. Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 20 junior teams in three divisions in the [[Canadian Junior Football League]] competing for the [[Canadian Bowl]]. The [[Quebec Junior Football League]] includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.\n\n[[Semi-professional]] leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the [[Alberta Football League]] becoming especially popular. The Northern Football Conference formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity for former college players who do not continue to professional football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the \"National Championship\". The Canadian Major Football League is the governing body for the semi-professional game.\n\nWomen's football has gained attention in recent years in Canada. The first Canadian women's league to begin operations was the [[Maritime Women's Football League]] in 2004. The largest women's league is the [[Western Women's Canadian Football League]].\n\n== The field ==\n[[File:Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, August 2005.jpg|thumb|Edmonton's [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]], in 2005. A [[Canadian Football League]] venue.]]\nThe Canadian football field is {{convert|150|yd|m|0}} long and {{convert|65|yd|m|0}} wide, within which the [[end zone|goal areas]] are {{convert|20|yd|m|0}} deep, and the goal lines are {{convert|110|yd|m|0}} apart. Including the endzones, the total area of the field is {{convert|87750|sqft}}.\n\nAt each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by an {{convert|18+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the ground) is preferred.\n\nThe sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} from the goal line. These lateral lines are called \"yard lines\" and often marked with the distance in yards from and an arrow pointed toward the nearest goal line. In previous decades, arrows were not used and every yard line (in both multiples of 5 and 10) was usually marked with the distance to the goal line, including the goal line itself which was marked with either a \"0\" or \"00\"; in most stadiums today, only the yard markers in multiples of 10 are marked with numbers, with the goal line sometimes being marked with a \"G\". The centre (55-yard) line usually is marked with a \"C\" (or, more rarely, with a \"55\"). \"Hash marks\" are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at {{convert|1|yd|m|1}} intervals, {{convert|24|yd|m|1}} from the sidelines.\n\nOn fields that have a surrounding [[running track]], such as [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]] and many [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|universities]], the end zones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. Until 1986,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://cfldb.ca/faq/game-rules-regulations/#what-is-the-size-of-the-cfl-field\n|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Game Rules and Regulations\n|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> the end zones were {{convert|25|yd|m}} deep, giving the field an overall length of {{convert|160|yd|m}}, and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners. The first field to feature the shorter 20-yard endzones was [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver's]] [[BC Place]] (home of the [[BC Lions]]), which opened in 1983. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field. The end zones in Toronto's [[BMO Field]] are only 18 yards instead of 20 yards.\n\n== Play of the game ==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}\nTeams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, [[prolate spheroid]] ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.\n\n=== Start of play ===\nAt the beginning of a match, an official tosses a coin and allows the captain of the visiting team call heads or tails. The captain of the team winning the coin toss is given the option of having first choice, or of deferring first choice to the other captain. The captain making first choice may either choose a) to kick off or receive the kick at the beginning of the half, or b) which direction of the field to play in. The remaining choice is given to the opposing captain. Before the resumption of play in the second half, the captain that did not have first choice in the first half is given first choice. Teams usually choose to defer, so it is typical for the team that wins the coin toss to kick to begin the first half and receive to begin the second.\n\nPlay begins at the start of each half with one team place-kicking the ball from its own 35-yard line. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.\n\n=== Stoppage of play ===\nPlay stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a ''tackle''); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from ''scrimmage''.\n\n=== Scrimmage ===\nBefore scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is similar to \"[[no-man's land]]\"; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.\n\n[[File:Anthony Calvillo game action, 93rd Grey Cup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montreal Alouettes]] quarterback [[Anthony Calvillo]] looks down field with the ball during the [[93rd Grey Cup]] game at [[BC Place]].]]\nOn the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence.<!-- Canadian spelling uses the \"c\" --> Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a \"direct snap\" to a running back is also not uncommon. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:\n* run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).\n* ''drop-kick'' the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football.)\n* pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a ''lateral'', and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a ''forward pass'' (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.\n* ''hand-off''\u2014hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.\n* ''punt'' the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it ''before'' it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the no-yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).\n* place the ball on the ground for a ''place kick''\n* throw a ''[[forward pass]]'', where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:\n** They must be made from ''behind'' the line of scrimmage\n** Only one forward pass may be made on a play\n** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver or pass 10 yards after the line of scrimmage\n\nEach play constitutes a ''down''. The offence<!-- Canadian spelling uses the \"c\" --> must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.\n\n=== Change in possession ===\nThe ball changes possession in the following instances:\n* If the offence scores a field goal, the scored-against team can either scrimmage from its 35-yard line or have the scoring team kickoff from its 35-yard line.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html |title=CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Company |accessdate=13 July 2010 | date=2009-05-11}}</ref>\n* If a team scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.\n* If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence's own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.\n* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.\n* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defence ''takes over on downs''.\n* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is ''intercepted'' by the defence; the defence takes possession immediately (and may try to advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.\n* If the offence ''fumbles'' (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.\n* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half will receive a kickoff to start the second half.\n* After the three-minute warning near the end of each half, the offence can lose possession for a time count violation (failure to legally put the ball into play within the 20-second duration of the play clock). However, this can only occur in one very specific scenario:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf |title=Rule 1, Section 7, Article 9: Time Count |work=The Official Playing Rules for the Canadian Football League 2015 |publisher=Canadian Football League |pages=18\u201319 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133157/http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n** The offence committed a time count violation on its last attempted scrimmage play.\n** This prior violation took place on third down.\n** The referee deemed said violation to be deliberate, and warned the offence that it had to legally place the ball into play within the 20-second clock or lose possession. Such a loss of possession is statistically treated as the defence taking over on downs.\n\n=== Rules of contact ===\nThere are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.\n\n=== Infractions and penalties ===\nInfractions of the rules are punished with ''penalties'', typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as ''offside'' (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations of the rules (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, from where the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.\n\nIf the defence is penalized on a two-point convert attempt and the offence chooses to attempt the play again, the offence must attempt another two-point convert; it cannot change to a one-point attempt. Conversely, the offence can attempt a two-point convert following a defensive penalty on a one-point attempt.\n\nPenalties may occur before a play starts (such as offside), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]).\n\nPenalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.\n\nIn most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of ''declining'' the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.\n\n=== Kicking ===\nCanadian football distinguishes four ways of kicking the ball:\n\n; [[Place kick]]: Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), optionally placed on a [[Tee#Kicking tee|tee]].\n; [[Drop kick]]: Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's [[Rugby football|rugby]] heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.\n; [[Punt (gridiron football)|Punt]]: Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.\n; Dribbled ball: A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.\n\nOn any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.\n\n=== Scoring ===\nThe methods of scoring are:\n\n; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's end zone, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a \"major score\" or simply a \"major.\"\n; Conversion (or convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored gets one scrimmage play to attempt to add one or two more points. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a \"point-after\"); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a \"two-point conversion\"). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents' 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well, but starting in 2015 the line of scrimmage for one-point kick attempts became the 25-yard line, while two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2015/04/08/major-rule-changes-approved-by-cfl-governors/|title=Major rule changes approved by CFL Governors|date=8 April 2015|work=cfl.ca}}</ref> No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).\n; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is '''not''' considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a '''rouge''' (see below).\n; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a ''single'' (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), by way of a kickoff from the 25 yard line or scrimmaging from the {{convert|35|yd|adj=on}} line on their side of the field.\n; [[Single (football)|Single (rouge)]] : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a Safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.\n:Officially, the single is called a ''rouge'' ([[French language|French]] for \"red\") but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag. A ''rouge'' is also a method of scoring in the [[Eton field game]], which dates from at least 1815.\n\n==== Resumption of play ====\nResumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.\n* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).\n* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard line.\n* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard line.\n* Following a single or [[rouge (football)|rouge]], play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the 35-yard line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.\n\n=== Game timing ===\nThe game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.\nA short break interval of 2 minutes occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break of 15 minutes at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.\n\nIn the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:\n* points are scored,\n* the ball goes out of bounds,\n* a forward pass is incomplete,\n* the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,\n* the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),\n* the ball is dead and a player is injured, or\n* the ball is dead and a captain or a coach calls a [[sport time-out|time-out]].\n\nThe clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).\n\nIn the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play\n* the ball was kicked off,\n* the ball was punted,\n* the ball changed possession,\n* the ball went out of bounds,\n* there were points scored,\n* there was an incomplete forward pass,\n* there was a penalty applied (not declined), or\n* there was a team time-out.\n\nDuring the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as \"time count\" (this foul is known as \"delay of game\" in American football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, as noted previously, the referee can give possession to the defence for repeated deliberate time count violations on third down.\n\nThe clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to ''decline'' any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.\n\n=== Overtime ===\nIn the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of offensive possessions to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and conducts a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a two-point conversion.<ref name=\"TSN-Rules2010\">{{cite web\n  | author = The Canadian Press\n  | authorlink = The Canadian Press\n  | title = CFL approves rule requiring two-point convert attempts in OT\n  | publisher = CTVglobemedia\n  | date = 2010-04-14\n  | url = http://tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=317959\n  | accessdate = 18 April 2010 }}</ref>\nThe other team then scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.\n\nIn U Sports football, for the [[Uteck Bowl]], [[Mitchell Bowl]], and [[Vanier Cup]], the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.\n\n== Players ==\n{| border=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:600px;\"\n|-\n|{{Image label begin|image=Canadian football positions.jpg|width=602}}\n{{Image label small|x=10.0|y=106.0|scale=1|text=[[running back|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">running<br>back</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=105.0|y=105.0|scale=1|text=[[quarterback|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">quarter-<br>back</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=70.0|y=50.0|scale=1|text=[[slotback|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">slot-<br>back</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=120.0|y=170.0|scale=1|text=[[slotback|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">slot-<br>backs</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=200.0|y=115.0|scale=1|text=[[offensive line|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">offensive<br>{{nbsp|4}}line</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=195.0|y=21.0|scale=1|text=[[wide receiver|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">wide<br>receiver</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=285.0|y=325.0|scale=1|text=[[wide receiver|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:#014617;\">wide<br>receiver</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=293.0|y=122.0|scale=1|text=[[defensive line|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">defensive<br>{{nbsp|3}}line</span>]]}}<!--Dinos' yellow: #ffd51d; with saturation set to 38 (lighter): #ffed9e;-->\n{{Image label small|x=360.0|y=115.0|scale=1|text=[[linebacker|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">line-<br>backers</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=495.0|y=115.0|scale=1|text=[[Official (Canadian football)#Umpire|<span style=\"background-color:white; opacity:0.75;\">umpire</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=405.0|y=30.0|scale=1|text=[[cornerback|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">cornerback</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=410.0|y=55.0|scale=1|text=[[defensive back|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">defensive<br>backs</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=465.0|y=170.0|scale=1|text=[[defensive back|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">defensive<br>backs</span>]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=570.0|y=312.0|scale=1|text=[[cornerback|<span style=\"background-color:#ed1b2d; opacity:0.75; line-height:1.3em; color:white;\">corner-<br>back</span>]]}}\n{{Image label end}}\n|- style=\"font-size:85%\"\n|\n----The offence (yellow and white) are [[down (football)|first-and-ten]] at their 54-yard line against the defence (red and black) in a [[U Sports football]] game.

However, among offensive players, the rules recognize three different types of players:\n\n; Down linemen: Down linemen are players who, at the start of every play, line up at the line of scrimmage; once in their stance, they may not move until the play begins. The offence must have at least seven players lined up at the line of scrimmage on every play. The exception to this rule is the player (typically the ''centre'') who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a hand-off or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it. Interior linemen (that is, excluding the two players at either end of the scrimmage line) are ineligible receivers; they may not receive a forward pass either. (The two [[offensive end]]s on the line of scrimmage may receive forward passes, and may be in motion along the line of scrimmage prior to the snap.)\n; Backs: Backs line up behind the linemen; they may run with the ball, receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.\n\nSpecific offensive positions include:\n\n;Backs/Receivers:\n; Quarterback: Generally the leader of the offence. Calls all plays to teammates, receives the ball off of snap, and initiates the action usually by running the ball himself, passing the ball to a receiver, or handing the ball off to another back.\n; Fullback: Multiple roles including pass protection, receiving, and blocking for the running back. On short yardage situations may also carry the ball.\n; Running back/Tailback: As the name implies, the main runner on the team. Also an eligible receiver and blocker on pass plays.\n; Wide receiver: Lines up on the line of scrimmage, usually at a distance from the centre. Runs a given route to make a successful play catch ball and gain yardage, not that a tight end can count as an eligible receiver  so if one is on the wide outs field that the wideout cannot be on the line of scrimmage and may adopt a slotback start.\n; [[Slotback]]: Is an eligible receiver but lines up off the line (usually 8yds back) of scrimmage and runs before snap and can not have any part on field over scrimmage or it's an off-side call\n; Down linemen:\n; Centre: Snaps the ball to the quarterback. Most important pass blocker on pass plays. Calls offensive line plays.\n; Left/right guard: Stands to the left and right of the centre helps protect the quarterback, Usually very good run blockers to open holes up the middle for runners.\n; Left/right tackle: Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over {{convert|300|lb}}. Usually very good pass blockers.\n; Offensive lineman: Collective name for the centre, guards and tackles.\n\n=== Defence ===\nThe rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself (other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts).\n\n; Cornerback: Covers the wide receivers on most plays.\n; Safety: Covers deep. Last line of defence, can offer run support or blitz.\n; Defensive halfback: Covers the slotback and helps contain the run from going to the outside.\n; Defensive back: Collective term for cornerback, safety and defensive halfback.\n; Nose tackle: Lineman across from centre, tries to get past the offensive-line or take double team and open holes for blitzes.\n; Defensive tackle: Inside defensive linemen try to break through the offensive line and open holes for linebackers.\n; Defensive end: Main rushing lineman.

This position is generally filled by a reserve quarterback; occasionally the starting quarterback or punter will fill in as holder.\n; Kicker: Kicks field goals, converts, kick-offs\n; Punter: Punts ball, usually on third downs\n; Returners: Fast, agile runners who specialize in fielding punts, field goals and kickoffs, attempting to advance them for better field position or a score.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Canadian football|Sport in Canada}}\n* [[Comparison of American and Canadian football]]\n* [[Glossary of Canadian football]]\n* [[List of gridiron football teams in Canada]]\n* [[Comparison of Canadian football and rugby league]]\n* [[Rugby football]]\n* [[Rugby league]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Canadian football}}\n* [https://www.cfl.ca/2016-cfl-rule-book-and-facts-figures-records/ CFL Rule Book] (2016)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070714004259/http://share.geocities.com/Colosseum/5743/index.htm Canadian Football Resources] (archived 14 July 2007)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070809030147/http://www.qjfl.ca/english/ Quebec Junior Football League]\n\n{{Sport in Canada}}\n{{Team Sport}}\n{{American football concepts}}\n{{CFL seasons}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian football| ]]\n[[Category:Canadian inventions]]\n[[Category:Football codes]]\n[[Category:Sports originating in Canada]]\n[[Category:Team sports]]", "sha1": "1a0gp471rta0y6n54eue1b50jcs9tll"}}, {"title": "Court Jester", "ns": "0", "id": "6965", "redirect": {"title": "Jester"}, "revision": {"id": "95103340", "parentid": "15905072", "timestamp": "2006-12-18T15:23:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "Duja", "id": "80797"}, "minor": "", "comment": "fix dbl redir", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Jester]]", "sha1": "ti8wstwc9rwhnznio47v75mhihwrsk0"}}, {"title": "Chinese calendar", "ns": "0", "id": "6966", "revision": {"id": "866634631", "parentid": "864406132", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T15:25:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "A garbage person", "id": "32251677"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Lunisolar calendars */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the traditional Chinese calendar|the most commonly and officially used calendar in modern China|Gregorian calendar|and|Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#China}}\n{{History of science and technology in China}}\n[[File:Chinese Calendar of 2017.png|thumb|alt=See caption|2017 Chinese calendar]]\n[[File:Chinese Calendar(Daoguang 15).jpg|thumb|alt+Handwritten calendar|Page of a Chinese calendar]]\nThe traditional '''Chinese calendar''' (officially known as the Rural Calendar [{{zh|labels=no |s=\u519c\u5386 |t=\u8fb2\u66c6 |p=N\u00f3ngl\u00ec |l=farming calendar}}]), or Former Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = \u65e7\u5386 |t = \u820a\u66c6 |p = Ji\u00f9l\u00ec}}), Traditional Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = \u8001\u5386 |t = \u8001\u66c6 |p = L\u01ceol\u00ec}}) or Lunar Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = \u9634\u5386 |t = \u9670\u66c6 |p = Y\u012bnl\u00ec |l = [[Yin and yang|yin]] calendar }}), is a [[lunisolar calendar]] which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. It is defined by [[GB/T]] 33661-2017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardization Administration of China on May 12, 2017. \n\nAlthough China uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays (such as the [[Chinese New Year]]) in China and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities. It lists the dates of traditional Chinese holidays and guides people in selecting auspicious days for [[Auspicious wedding dates|weddings]], funerals, moving, or starting a business.\n\nLike [[Chinese characters]], variants of this calendar are used in different parts of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural sphere]]. Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the calendar, and it evolved into [[Korean calendar|Korean]], [[Vietnamese calendar|Vietnamese]], and [[Ryukyuan religion#religious calendar|Ryukyuan calendars]]. The main difference from the traditional Chinese calendar is the use of different [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], which leads to some astronomical events\u2014and calendar events based on them\u2014falling on different dates. The traditional [[Japanese calendar]] also derived from the Chinese calendar (based on a Japanese meridian), but its official use in Japan was abolished in 1873 as part of reforms after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Calendars in [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolia]] and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibet]] have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar, but are not direct descendants of it.\n\nDays begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the [[new moon]]. Years begin on the second (or third) new moon after the [[winter solstice]]. [[Solar term]]s govern the beginning and end of each month. Written versions in ancient China{{when|date=May 2018}} included [[sexagenary cycle|stems and branches]] of the year and the names of each month, including [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|leap months]] as needed. Characters indicated whether a month was long ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|\u5927}}}}, 30 days) or short ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}, 29 days); stem branches for the first, eleventh, and 21st days, and the date, stem branch and time of the solar terms.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section |date=October 2018}}\n==={{anchor|Earlier Chinese calendars|Ancient Chinese calendars}}Solar calendars===\n[[File:Five Phases and Four Seasons Calendar.png|thumb|alt=See caption|Five-phase and four-quarter calendars]]\nThe traditional Chinese calendar was developed between 771 and 476 BC, during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the [[Eastern Zhou]] dynasty. Before the [[Zhou dynasty]], solar calendars were used. \n\nOne version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u4e94\u884c\u5386|t=\u4e94\u884c\u66c6}}), which derives from the [[Wu Xing]]. A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u884c\u5fa1}}), followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long.

According to [[oracle bone]] records, the [[Shang dynasty]] calendar ({{Circa|1600|1046}} BC) was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was ''Zh\u0113ngyu\u00e8''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmth.net/bbsanc.php?path=/groups/sci.faq/Astronomy/bw/all2/bk37k/M.1275291864.z0&ap=353 |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u5386\u53d1\u5c55\u7b80\u53f2 |trans-title=A brief history of the development of Chinese Lunar calendar |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n====Lunisolar calendars====\nThe first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5468\u66c6|s=\u5468\u5386}}), introduced under the [[Zhou dynasty]]. This calendar set the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice. It also set the ''sh\u00e0ngyu\u00e1n'' as the winter solstice of a ''d\u012bngs\u00ec'' year, making the year it was introduced around 2,758,130.{{cn|date=October 2018|reason=Also needs an explanation.}}\n\nSeveral competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the [[Warring States period]]. The state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] issued its own Lu calendar({{zh|labels=no|t=\u9b6f\u66c6|s=\u9c81\u5386}}). [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] issued the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u590f\u66c6|s=\u590f\u5386}}) in 102 AD,<ref name=\"Petersen\">{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Jens \u00d8sterg\u00e5rd |year=1992 |title=The Taiping Jing and the A.D. 102 Clepsydra Reform |journal=Acta Orientalia |volume=53 |location=Copenhagen |pages=122\u2013158 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12945035/The_Taiping_Jing_%E5%A4%AA%E5%B9%B3%E7%B6%93_and_the_A.D._102_Clepsydra_Reform}}</ref> with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the [[March equinox]].

Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months (a 13th month) are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by mountain peoples.\n\n===={{anchor|Calendar of the Qin and early Han dynasties}}Qin and early Han dynasties====\nAfter [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the Qin calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u79e6\u66c6|s=\u79e6\u5386}}) was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second ''Ji\u01d4yu\u00e8'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5f8c\u4e5d\u6708|s=\u540e\u4e5d\u6708|l=later ''Ji\u01d4yu\u00e8''}}), was placed at the end of the year.

His Taichu Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u592a\u521d\u66c6|s=\u592a\u521d\u5386|l=grand beginning calendar}}) defined a solar year as {{frac|365|385|1539}} days, and the lunar month was {{frac|29|43|81}} days. This calendar introduced the 24 [[solar term]]s, dividing the year into 24 equal parts. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms. {{citation needed span|date=October 2018|text=The first solar term of the period was known as a pre-climate, and the second was a mid-climate. Months were named for the mid-climate to which they were closest, and a month without a mid-climate was an intercalary month.}}\n\nThe Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula. The D\u00e0m\u00edng Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5927\u660e\u66c6|s=\u5927\u660e\u5386|l=brightest calendar}}), created in the [[Liang dynasty]] by [[Zhu Chongzhi]], introduced the equinoxes.

In the early [[Qing dynasty]], [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] submitted the calendar to the [[Shunzhi Emperor]]. The Qing government issued it as the Sh\u00edxi\u00e0n (seasonal) calendar.\n\nIn this calendar, the [[solar term]]s are 15\u00b0 each along the [[ecliptic]] and it can be used as a [[solar calendar]]. However, the length of the climate term near [[Apsis|perihelion]] is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The Sh\u00edxi\u00e0n calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to \"decides the month in sequence, except the intercalary month.\"{{Quote without source|date=October 2018}} The present traditional calendar follows the Sh\u00edxi\u00e0n calendar, except:\n# The baseline is Chinese Standard Time, rather than Beijing local time.\n# Astronomical data is used, rather than mathematical calculations.\n\n===={{anchor|Proposals to optimize the Chinese calendar}}Proposals====\nTo optimize the Chinese calendar, astronomers have proposed a number of changes. Gao Pingzi ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u9ad8\u5e73\u5b50}}; 1888-1970), a Chinese astronomer who co-founded the [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], proposed that month numbers be calculated before the new moon and solar terms be rounded to the day. Since the intercalary month is determined by the first month without a mid-climate and the mid-climate time varies by time zone, countries which adopted the calendar but calculate with their own time could vary from the time in China.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Other practices}}Outlying areas ===\nCalendars of ethnic groups in the mountains and plateaus of southwestern China and the grasslands of northern China are based on their [[phenology]] and algorithms of traditional calendars of different periods, particularly the Tang and pre-Qin dynasties.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Structure ==\n=== {{anchor|General}}Elements ===\nElements of the traditional Chinese calendar are:\n* ''Day'', from one midnight to the next\n* ''Month'', the time from one [[new moon]] to the next.

The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches make up [[Sexagenary cycle|60 stem-branches]]. The stem-branches mark days and years.

Instead of using half-days to balance months with the lunar cycle, every other month of the year has 29 days (short month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5c0f\u6708}}}}) and the rest have 30 (long month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5927\u6708}}}}). Years start on a long month and alternate. \n\nA 12-month-year using this system has 354 days, which would drift significantly from the [[tropical year]]. To fix this, traditional Chinese years have a 13-month year every other year. The 13-month version has the same alternation of long and short months, but adds a 30-day month at the end of the year. Years with 12 months are called common years, and 13-month years are known as long years. \n\nAlthough most of the above rules were used until the [[Tang dynasty]], different eras used different systems to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] of the Taichu calendar was {{frac|29|43|81}} days long. The 7th-century, Tang-dynasty W\u00f9y\u00edn Yu\u00e1n Calendar was the first to determine month length by synodic month instead of the cycling method. Since then, month lengths have primarily been determined by observation and prediction.\n\nThe days of the month are numbered beginning with 1, and the day number is written with two characters.\nDays one to 10 are written with the day [[Chinese numerals|numeral]], preceded by the character ''Ch\u016b'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u521d}}}}); ''Ch\u016by\u012b'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u521d\u4e00}}}}) is the first day of the month, and ''Ch\u016bsh\u00ed'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u521d{{linktext|\u5341}}}}) the 10th. Days 11 to 20 are written as numerals; ''Sh\u00edw\u01d4'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5341\u4e94}}}}) is the 15th day of the month, and ''\u00c8rsh\u00ed'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u4e8c\u5341}}}}) the 20th. Days 21 to 29 are written with the character ''Ni\u00e0n'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5eff}}}}) before the characters one through nine; ''Ni\u00e0ns\u0101n'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5eff\u4e09}}}}), for example, is the 23rd day of the month. Day 30 (as applicable) is written as the numeral ''S\u0101nsh\u00ed'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u4e09\u5341}}}}).\n\nHistory books use days of the month numbered with the 60 stem-branches: {{Quote| text={{zh|labels=no|c=\u5929\u8056\u5143\u5e74....{{linktext|\u4e8c\u6708}}....{{linktext|\u4e01|\u5df3}}, \u5949\u5b89\u592a\u7956\u3001\u592a\u5b97\u5fa1\u5bb9\u4e8e\u5357\u4eac\u9d3b\u6176\u5bae}}. <br />[[Tiansheng Era (Song)|''Ti\u0101nsh\u00e8ng'']] 1st year....''\u00c8ryu\u00e8''....''D\u012bngs\u00ec'', the emperor's funeral was at his temple, and the imperial portrait was installed in Nanjing's ''Hongqing Palace''. |title=[[History of Song Dynasty]]|sign=|source=[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/\u5b8b\u53f2/\u5377009 Part 9, Volume 9: Renzong part 1] {{link language|zh}}}}\n\nBecause astronomical observation determines month length, dates on the calendar correspond to moon phases. The first day of each month is the new moon. On the seventh or eighth day of each month, the first-quarter moon is visible in the afternoon and early evening. In the 15th or 16th day of each month, the full moon is visible all night. On the 22nd or 23rd day of each month, the last-quarter moon is visible late at night and in the morning.\n\nSince the beginning of the month is determined by the new moon occurs, other countries using this calendar use their own time standards to calculate it; this results in deviations. The first new moon in 1968 was at 16:29 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on January 29. Since [[North Vietnam]] used [[UTC+07:00]] to calculate their [[Vietnamese calendar]] and [[South Vietnam]] used [[UTC+08:00]] (Beijing time) to calculate theirs, North Vietnam began the [[T\u1ebft]] holiday at January 29 at 23:29 and South Vietnam began it on January 30 at 00:15. The time difference allowed asynchronous attacks in the [[Tet Offensive]].<ref name=\"aslaksen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf |title=Mathematics of the Chinese calendar |last=Aslaksen |first=Helmer |date=July 17, 2010 |format=PDF |lang=en |website=www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen|publisher=Department of Maths, National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\n===Solar year and solar term===\n{{See also|Solar term}}\nThe [[tropical year|solar year]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u5c81|t=\u6b72|p=Su\u00ec}}), the time between [[winter solstice]]s, is divided into 24 [[solar term]]s. Different versions of the traditional calendar might have different average solar-year lengths. One solar year of the [[1st century BC]] T\u00e0ich\u016b calendar is {{frac|365|385|1539}} (365.25016) days. A solar year of the 13th-century Sh\u00f2ush\u00ed calendar is {{frac|365|97|400}} (365.2425) days, identical to the Gregorian calendar. The additional .00766 day from the T\u00e0ich\u016b calendar leads to a one-day shift every 130.5 years.\n\nPairs of solar terms are climate terms, or solar months. The first solar term is \"pre-climate\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u8282\u6c14|t=\u7bc0\u6c23|p=Ji\u00e9q\u00ec}}), and the second is \"mid-climate\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u4e2d\u6c14|t=\u4e2d\u6c23|p=Zh\u014dngq\u00ec}}).\n\nThere are generally 11 or 12 complete months, plus two incomplete months around the winter solstice, in a solar year. The 11 mid-climates, except for the winter solstice, are in the 11 or 12 complete months. The complete months are numbered from 0 to 10, and the incomplete months are considered the 11th month.\n\nThe first month without a mid-climate is the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|leap]], or intercalary, month. Leap months are numbered with ''r\u00f9n'' {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u958f}}}}, the character for \"intercalary\", plus the name of the month they follow. In 2017, the intercalary month after month six was called ''R\u00f9n Li\u00f9yu\u00e8'', or \"intercalary sixth month\" ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u958f|\u516d\u6708}}}}) and written as ''6i'' or ''6+''. The next intercalary month (in 2020, after month four) will be called ''R\u00f9n S\u00ecyu\u00e8'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u958f|\u56db\u6708}}}}) and written ''4i'' or ''4+''.\n\n==={{anchor|Estimate the Chinese date|Birthday issue}}Lunisolar year===\nThe lunisolar year begins with the first spring month, ''Zh\u0113ngyu\u00e8'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u6b63\u6708}}|l=capital month}}), and ends with the last winter month, ''L\u00e0yu\u00e8'' ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|\u814a\u6708}}|t={{linktext|\u81d8\u6708}}|l=sacrificial month}}). All other months are named for their number in the month order. If a leap month falls after month 11\u2014as it will in 2033\u2014the 11th month will be ''Sh\u00ed\u00e8ryu\u00e8'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5341\u4e8c\u6708}}|l=twelfth month}}), and the leap month will be ''L\u00e0yu\u00e8''.\n\nYears were traditionally numbered by the reign in ancient China, but this was abolished after the founding of the People's Republic of [[China]] in 1949.

When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of its marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgement of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions.

H. (2012). Customer relationship management  Benefits for Customers: Literature Review (2005-2012).</ref>\n\n# Improve customer services: In general, customers would have some questions, concerns or requests. CRM services provide the ability to a company for producing, allocating and managing requests or something made by customers. For example, [[call center]] software, which helps to connect a customer to the manager or person who can best assist them with their existing problem, is one of the CRM abilities that can be implemented to increase efficiency.<ref>Bolte, T.

For example, [[MBNA]] Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction.

One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate or anything in between.<ref name=\":45\"/>\n\n=== Analyzing the information ===\nManagers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can [[data collection|collect]] this information by using [[survey (human research)|surveys]], interviews, and more, with current customers. For example, [[Frito-Lay]] conducted many [[ethnographic]] interviews with customers to try and understand the relationships they wanted with the companies and the brands. They found that most customers were adults who used the product to feel more playful. They may have enjoyed the company's bright orange color, messiness and shape.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nCompanies must also improve their relational intelligence of their CRM systems. These days, companies store and receive huge amounts of data through [[email]]s, [[online chat]] sessions, phone calls, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A CRM success story|url = http://www.computerworld.com/article/2578532/crm/a-crm-success-story.html|website = Computerworld|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}</ref> Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence.<ref name=\":72\"/> Companies can use [[data mining]] technologies and [[web search]]es to understand relational signals. [[Social media]] such as Facebook, Twitter, [[blog]]s, etc. is also a very important factor in picking up and analyzing information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customer's signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.<ref name=\":6\">Avery, Jill.

By managing different portfolios for different segments of the customer base, the firm can achieve strategic goals.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Employee training ===\nMany firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and effectively create strong customer-brand relationships. For example, [[Harley Davidson]] sent its employees on the road with customers, who were motorcycle enthusiasts, to help solidify relationships. Other employees have also been trained in [[social psychology]] and the [[social science]]s to help bolster strong customer relationships.

There are fewer figure propositions in business-to-business, but in some cases, they cost a lot more than business-to-consumer items and relationships in business-to-business environment are built over a longer period of time. Furthermore, business-to-business CRM must be easily integrated with products from other companies. Such integration enables the creation of forecasts about customer behavior based on their buying history, bills, business success, etc. An application for a business-to-business company must have a function to connect all the contacts, processes and deals among the customers segment and then prepare a paper. Automation of sales process is an important requirement for business-to-business products. It should effectively manage the deal and progress it through all the phases towards signing.

The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly, so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communications with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly.

It is derived from [[grand hazard]] and both can be considered a variant of [[sic bo]], which is a popular [[casino game]], although chuck-a-luck is more of a [[carnival game]] than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for [[Charitable organization|charity]].\n\n==Rules==\nChuck-a-luck is played with three standard [[dice]] that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an [[hourglass]] that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.\n\nWagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice.  The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in [[sic bo]] and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.\n\nThe wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.<!-- Note that \"dice\" is plural, the  singular being \"die\"; do not \"correct\" this, as you would actually be introducing a grammatical error -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type\n!Wager\n!Odds\n|-\n|Single Die Bet\n|A specific number will appear\n|1 die, 1 to 1; 2 dice, 2 to 1; 3 dice, 10 to 1 (sometimes 3 to 1)\n|-\n|Any Triple (sometimes offered)\n|Any of the triples (all three dice show the same number) will appear\n|30 to 1\n|-\n|Big (sometimes offered)\n|The total score will be 11 (sometimes 12) or higher with the exception of a triple\n|1 to 1\n|-\n|Small (sometimes offered)\n|The total score will be 10 (sometimes 9) or lower with the exception of a triple\n|1 to 1\n|-\n|Field (sometimes offered)\n|The total score will be outside the range of 8 to 12 (inclusive)\n|1 to 1\n|}\n\n==House advantage or edge==\n{{Expert-subject|Gambling|section|date=February 2009}}\nChuck-a-luck is a [[gambling|game of chance]]. That is, on average, the players are expected to lose more than they win.  The casino's advantage ([[house advantage]] or house edge) is greater than most other [[casino games]] and can be much greater.\n\nFor example, there are 216 (6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6) possible outcomes for a single throw of three dice. For a specific number:\n\n* there are 75 possible outcomes, where only one die will match the number;<!-- Note that \"dice\" is plural, the  singular being \"die\"; do not \"correct\" this, as you would actually be introducing a grammatical error -->\n* there are 15 possible outcomes, where only two dice will match; and\n* there is one possible outcome, where all three dice will match.\n\nAt odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) \u00d7 2 + (15/216) \u00d7 3 + (1/216) \u00d7 11) = 4.6%\n\nAt worse odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) \u00d7 2 + (15/216) \u00d7 3 + (1/216) \u00d7 4) = 7.9%\n\nIt should be noted that if the odds are adjusted to 1 to 1, 3 to 1 and 5 to 1 respectively, the expected loss as a percentage is:\n\n1 - ((75/216) \u00d7 2 + (15/216) \u00d7 4 + (1/216) \u00d7 6) = 0%\n\nHowever, commercially organised gambling games always have a house advantage which acts as a fee for the privilege of being allowed to play the game, so the last scenario does not represent real practice.\n\n==Variants==\n* A version of the [[Big Six wheel]] is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with various combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.\n* Chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to the traditional Vietnamese game [[Bau cua ca cop]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThere is a reference to chuck-a-luck in the [[Abbott and Costello]] film ''[[Hold That Ghost]]''.\n\nIn [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1952 film, ''[[Rancho Notorious]]'', chuck-a-luck is the name of the ranch run by Altar Keane (played by [[Marlene Dietrich]]) where outlaws hide from the law. Chuck-a-luck is featured in the lyrics to the theme song and in some plot points.\n\nThe game is played by Lazar in the James Bond movie ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.\n\nThe game is played by [[Freddie Rumsen]] in ''Mad Men Season 2 Episode 9: Six-Month Leave''.\n\nIn [[Dragonfly in Amber]] the character Claire Randall describes the activity inside of an inn as having a several soldiers playing chuck-a-luck on the floor along with a dog sleeping by the fire and smelling strongly of hops.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Crown and anchor]]\n\n[[Category:Dice games]]", "sha1": "fsug234e8ro1v071lch3l1khcm5xoky"}}, {"title": "Chipmunk", "ns": "0", "id": "6972", "revision": {"id": "866543391", "parentid": "866543353", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T00:06:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pvmoutside", "id": "1956573"}, "comment": "/* See also */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Chipmunk (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-move-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Automatic Taxobox\n| name = Chipmunk\n| fossil_range =Early [[Miocene]] to Recent\n| image = Chipmunk (71669).jpg\n| image_caption = \n| taxon = Tamias\n| authority = [[Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger|Illiger]], 1811<ref>{{cite book|last1=Illigeri|first1=Caroli|title=Prodromus systematis mammalium et avium|date=1811|publisher=C.

Chipmunks are found in [[North America]], with the exception of the [[Siberian chipmunk]] which is found primarily in [[Asia]].\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nChipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, ''Tamias'' ({{lang-el|\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}), or as three genera: ''Tamias'', of which the [[eastern chipmunk]] (''T. striatus'') is the only living member; ''[[Eutamias]]'', of which the [[Siberian chipmunk]] (''E. sibiricus'') is the only living member; and ''[[Neotamias]]'', which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus. However, studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between ''[[Marmot]]a'' and ''[[Spermophilus]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/msw/ | title = Mammal Species of the World | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | author = Wilson, D.

It includes the theory and application of new and existing computer [[software]] technologies and basic aspects of music, such as [[sound synthesis]], [[digital signal processing]], [[sound design]], sonic diffusion, [[acoustics]], and [[psychoacoustics]]. The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origins of [[electronic music]], and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIn the 2000s, with the widespread availability of relatively affordable [[personal computing|home computers]] that have a fast processing speed, and the growth of [[home recording]] using [[digital audio recording]] systems ranging from [[Garageband]] to [[Protools]], the term is sometimes used to describe music that has been created using digital technology.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Computer music programming languages}}\n[[image:CSIRAC-Pano,-Melb.-Museum,-12.8.2008.jpg|thumb|left|300x300px|[[CSIRAC]], Australia's first digital computer, as displayed at the [[Melbourne Museum]]]]\nMuch of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between [[music]] and [[mathematics]], a relationship which has been noted since the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] described the \"[[harmony of the spheres]]\".\n\nMusical melodies were first generated by the computer [[CSIRAC]] in Australia in 1950.

Although any music which uses computers in its composition or realisation is computer-generated to some extent, the use of computers is now so widespread (in the editing of pop songs, for instance) that the phrase computer-generated music is generally used to mean a kind of music which could not have been created ''without'' the use of computers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nWe can distinguish two groups of computer-generated music: music in which a computer generated the score, which could be performed by humans, and music which is both composed and performed by computers. There is a large genre of music that is organized, synthesized, and created on computers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Music composed and performed by computers===\n{{Main|Algorithmic composition}}\n{{See also|Generative music|Evolutionary music|Genetic algorithm}}\nLater, composers such as [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] had computers generate the sounds of the composition as well as the score. Koenig produced [[algorithmic composition]] programs which were a generalisation of his own [[serial composition]] practice. This is not exactly similar to Xenakis' work as he used mathematical abstractions and examined how far he could explore these musically. Koenig's software translated the calculation of mathematical equations into codes which represented musical notation. This could be converted into musical notation by hand and then performed by human players. His programs Project 1 and Project 2 are examples of this kind of software. Later, he extended the same kind of principles into the realm of synthesis, enabling the computer to produce the sound directly. SSP is an example of a program which performs this kind of function. All of these programs were produced by Koenig at the [[Institute of Sonology]] in [[Utrecht]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nProcedures such as those used by Koenig and Xenakis are still in use today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Since the invention of the [[MIDI]] system in the early 1980s, for example, some people have worked on programs which map MIDI notes to an algorithm and then can either output sounds or music through the computer's [[sound card]] or write an [[audio file format|audio file]] for other programs to play.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSome of these simple programs are based on [[fractal geometry]], and can map midi notes to specific [[fractal]]s, or fractal equations. Although such programs are widely available and are sometimes seen as clever toys for the non-musician, some professional musicians have given them attention also. The resulting 'music' can be more like noise, or can sound quite familiar and pleasant. As with much algorithmic music, and [[algorithmic art]] in general, more depends on the way in which the parameters are mapped to aspects of these equations than on the equations themselves. Thus, for example, the same equation can be made to produce both a lyrical and melodic piece of music in the style of the mid-nineteenth century, and a fantastically dissonant [[cacophony]] more reminiscent of the avant-garde music of the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nOther programs can map mathematical formulae and constants to produce sequences of notes. In this manner, an [[irrational number]] can give an infinite sequence of notes where each note is a digit in the decimal expression of that number. This sequence can in turn be a composition in itself, or simply the basis for further elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nOperations such as these, and even more elaborate operations can also be performed in computer music programming languages such as [[Max/MSP]], [[Reaktor]], [[SuperCollider]], [[Csound]], [[Pure Data]] (Pd), [[Keykit]], and [[ChucK]]. These programs now easily run on most personal computers, and are often capable of more complex functions than those which would have necessitated the most powerful mainframe computers several decades ago.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThere exist programs that generate \"human-sounding\" melodies by using a vast database of phrases. One example is [[Band-in-a-Box]], which is capable of creating [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]] instrumental solos with almost no user interaction. Another is [[Impro-Visor]], which uses a [[stochastic context-free grammar]] to generate phrases and complete solos.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nAnother 'cybernetic' approach to computer composition uses specialized hardware to detect external stimuli which are then mapped by the computer to realize the performance. Examples of this style of computer music can be found in the middle-80's work of [[David Rokeby]] (Very Nervous System) where audience/performer motions are 'translated' to MIDI segments. Computer controlled music is also found in the performance pieces by the Canadian composer [[Udo Kasemets]] such as the Marce(ntennia)l Circus C(ag)elebrating Duchamp (1987), a realization of the [[Marcel Duchamp]] process piece ''Erratum Musical'' using an electric model train to collect a hopper-car of stones to be deposited on a drum wired to an Analog:Digital converter, mapping the stone impacts to a score display (performed in Toronto by pianist [[Gordon Monahan]] during the 1987 Duchamp Centennial), or his installations and performance works (e.g. Spectrascapes) based on his Geo(sono)scope (1986) 15x4-channel computer-controlled audio mixer. In these latter works, the computer generates sound-scapes from tape-loop sound samples, live shortwave or sine-wave generators.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Computer-generated scores for performance by human players===\nMany systems for generating musical scores actually existed well before the time of computers. One of these was [[Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel]] ''(Musical dice game''; 18th century), a system which used throws of the dice to randomly select measures from a large collection of small phrases. When patched together, these phrases combined to create musical pieces which could be performed by human players. Although these works were not actually composed with a computer in the modern sense, it uses a rudimentary form of the random combinatorial techniques sometimes used in computer-generated composition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe world's first digital computer music was generated in Australia by programmer Geoff Hill on the [[CSIRAC]] computer which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard, although it was only used to play standard tunes of the day. Subsequently, one of the first composers to write music with a computer was [[Iannis Xenakis]]. He wrote programs in the [[FORTRAN]] language that generated numeric data that he transcribed into scores to be played by traditional [[musical instrument]]s. An example is ''ST/48'' of 1962. Although Xenakis could well have composed this music by hand, the intensity of the calculations needed to transform probabilistic mathematics into musical notation was best left to the number-crunching power of the computer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nComputers have also been used in an attempt to imitate the music of great composers of the past, such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. A present exponent of this technique is [[David Cope]]. He wrote computer programs that analyse works of other composers to produce new works in a similar style. He has used this program to great effect with composers such as Bach and Mozart (his program ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'' is famous for creating \"Mozart's 42nd Symphony\"), and also within his own pieces, combining his own creations with that of the computer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n[[Melomics]], a research project from the [[University of M\u00e1laga]], Spain, developed a computer composition cluster named [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]], which composes complex, multi-instrument pieces for editing and performance. Since its inception, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] has composed a full album in 2012, appropriately named [[Iamus (album)|Iamus]], which [[New Scientist]] described as \"The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal=New Scientist |date=5 July 2012 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}</ref> The group has also developed an [[API]] for developers to utilize the technology, and makes its music available on its website.\n\n==={{anchor|Computer-Aided Algorithmic Composition}}Computer-aided algorithmic composition===\n[[Image:GenSystemVenn.png|thumb|right|Diagram illustrating the position of CAAC in relation to other [[Generative music]] Systems]]Computer-aided algorithmic composition (CAAC, pronounced \"sea-ack\") is the implementation and use of [[algorithmic composition]] techniques in software. This label is derived from the combination of two labels, each too vague for continued use. The label ''computer-aided composition'' lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms. Music produced with notation or sequencing software could easily be considered computer-aided composition. The label ''algorithmic composition'' is likewise too broad, particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer. The term [[computer-aided]], rather than computer-assisted, is used in the same manner as [[computer-aided design]].<ref>Christopher Ariza: An Open Design for Computer-Aided Algorithmic Music Composition, Universal-Publishers Boca Raton, Florida, 2005, p. 5</ref>\n\n==Machine improvisation==\n{{See also|Machine learning|Machine listening|Artificial intelligence|Computer models of musical creativity}}\nMachine improvisation uses computer algorithms to create [[improvisation]] on existing music materials. This is usually done by sophisticated recombination of musical phrases extracted from existing music, either live or pre-recorded. In order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style, machine improvisation uses [[machine learning]] and [[pattern matching]] algorithms to analyze existing musical examples. The resulting patterns are then used to create new variations \"in the style\" of the original music, developing a notion of stylistic reinjection.\nThis is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use [[algorithmic composition]] to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Statistical style modeling===\nStyle modeling implies building a computational representation of the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data. Statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions, which are later recombined to generate new musical data. Style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles. Machine Improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with Hiller and Isaacson's ''Illiac Suite for String Quartet'' (1957) and Xenakis' uses of [[Markov chains]] and [[stochastic processes]]. Modern methods include the use of [[lossless data compression]] for incremental parsing, [[prediction suffix tree]] and [[string searching]] by [[factor oracle]] algorithm (basically a ''factor oracle'' is a finite state automaton constructed in linear time and space in an incremental fashion<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtMYxwzUL00C&pg=PA295&dq=Factor+oracle:+a+new+structure+for+pattern+matching&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6TyfUtTlA4yxrgGfxIGYBw&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Factor%20oracle%3A%20a%20new%20structure%20for%20pattern%20matching&f=false |editor1=Jan Pavelka |editor2=Gerard Tel |editor3=Miroslav Bartosek |quote=Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1725 |pages=291\u2013306 |publisher=Springer-Verlag, Berlin |year=1999 |isbn=3-540-66694-X |title=Factor oracle: a new structure for pattern matching; Proceedings of SOFSEM\u201999; Theory and Practice of Informatics |accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>).\n\n===Uses of machine improvisation===\nMachine improvisation encourages musical creativity by providing automatic modeling and transformation structures for existing music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} This creates a natural interface with the musician without need for coding musical algorithms. In live performance, the system re-injects the musician's material in several different ways, allowing a semantics-level representation of the session and a smart recombination and transformation of this material in real-time. In offline version, machine improvisation can be used to achieve style mixing, an approach inspired by Vannevar Bush's [[memex]] imaginary machine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Implementations===\n\nThe first system implementing interactive machine improvisation by means of [[Markov models]] and style modeling techniques is the Continuator,<ref>[http://francoispachet.fr/continuator/continuator.html]</ref> developed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pachet]] at Sony CSL Paris in 2002<ref>Pachet, F., [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/uploads/pachet-02f.pdf The Continuator: Musical Interaction with Style].

Traditionally most computer music programs have tended toward the old write/compile/run model which evolved when computers were much less powerful. This approach has locked out code-level innovation by people whose programming skills are more modest. Some programs have gradually integrated real-time controllers and gesturing (for example, [[MIDI]]-driven software synthesis and parameter control). Until recently, however, the musician/composer rarely had the capability of real-time modification of program code itself.

Additionally, there is the \"basic\" or \"middle\" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.<ref>Eysenck. M.

Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it \"believing\", \"doubting\", \"wondering\", \"accepting\", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology.

The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract</ref>\n\n[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,<ref name=\"concepts core readings\">{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3\u201383|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}</ref>\n\nThere is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept \"dog\" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept \u2013 or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].<ref name=\"Origin of Concepts\" /> Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called \"lexical concepts\".<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" />\n\nStudy of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].<ref name=\"Big Book\" />\n\nIn the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word \"moon\" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.\n\n=== A priori concepts ===\n{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}\n\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction \"a posteriori concepts\" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., \u00a71, Note 1)\n\nA concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.\n{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:\n\n# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;\n# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally\n# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...\n\nIn order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, \u00a76}}\n\n===Embodied content===\n{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}\n\nIn [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier & Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Ontology===\n{{Main article|Ontology}}\n\n[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.<ref>'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\n[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).\n\nAccording to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.\n\n== Mental representations ==\n{{Main article|Mental representation}}\n\nIn a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.<ref name=\"Origin of Concepts\">{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Big Book\">{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}</ref> Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.<ref name=\"Origin of Concepts\" /> The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nConcepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,<ref>Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor & Francis</ref> in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  (\"Sort\" is itself another word for concept, and \"sorting\" thus means to organise into concepts.)\n\n== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==\n\n=== Classical theory ===\n{{Main article|Definitionism}}\n\nThe classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,<ref name=\"Origin of Concepts\" /> is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle<ref name=\"Big Book\" />), and was prominently held until the 1970s.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.<ref name=\"Origin of Concepts\" /> Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.<ref name=\"Big Book\" />\n\nThe classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] \u2013 [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic \"[[Time Without Change]]\" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.\n\n==== Arguments against the classical theory ====\nGiven that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> summarized as follows:\n*It seems that there simply are no definitions \u2013 especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> See below.\n*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n\n=== Prototype theory ===\n{{Main article|Prototype theory}}\n\nPrototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /><ref name=\"new paradigm\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159\u2013166}}</ref> Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /><ref name=\"new paradigm\" /> It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member \u2013 the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.\n\n=== Theory-theory ===\nTheory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.<ref name=\"Stanford Encycl\" /> Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.<ref name=\"Big Book\" /> In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" /> When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory\u2013Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.<ref name=\"concepts core readings\" />\n\n== Ideasthesia ==\nAccording to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or \"sensing concepts\"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.<ref name=\"MroczkoNikolic2014\">Mroczko-W\u0105sowicz, A., Nikoli\u0107 D.

As a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] serving in South Korea, Powell was very close to General [[Henry \"Gunfighter\" Emerson]]. Powell said he regarded Emerson as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson insisted his troops train at night to fight a possible North Korean attack, and made them repeatedly watch the television film ''[[Brian's Song]]'' to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare. After a [[race riot]] occurred, in which [[African American]] soldiers almost killed a White officer, Powell was charged by Emerson to crack down on [[Black Power|black militants]]; Powell's efforts led to the discharge of one soldier, and other efforts to reduce racial tensions.<ref name=\"CNN1996\" /> During 1976\u20131977 he commanded the 2nd Brigade of the [[101st Airborne Division]].<ref name=\"CNN staff\"/>\n\n===A \"political general\"===\nIn the early 1980s, Powell served at [[Fort Carson, Colorado]].

Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years.\n<ref name=WashingtonPost_Kessler_20040714 >{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48010-2004Jul13.html|title=Powell Flies in the Face of Tradition; The Secretary of State Is Least Traveled in 30 Years |author=Kessler, Glenn|date=July 14, 2004| page=A01|work=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Powell was in [[Lima]], Peru, meeting with President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and [[US Ambassador]] John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] that subsequently adopted the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]], Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the [[War on Terrorism]].\n\nPowell came under fire for his role in [[Rationale for the Iraq War|building the case]] for the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said that [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Iraq had prevented the development of any [[weapons of mass destruction]] by [[Saddam Hussein]]. As was the case in the days leading up to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] in front of the [[9/11 Commission]]. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a [[Unilateralism|unilateral approach]]. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.\n\n[[File:Powell UN Iraq presentation, alleged Mobile Production Facilities.jpg|thumb|300px|Computer-generated image of an alleged [[Mobile weapons laboratory|mobile production facility for biological weapons]], presented by Powell at the UN [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|Security Council]].

The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light.  Having done so, these same centers execute their second function: the transfer of that light energy by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specific chlorophyll pair in the [[reaction center]] of the photosystems.  This pair effects the final function of chlorophylls, charge separation, leading to biosynthesis.\nThe two currently accepted photosystem units are [[photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]], which have their own distinct reaction centres, named [[P680]] and [[P700]], respectively. These centres are named after the wavelength (in [[nanometer]]s) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them.

The absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation. The removal of the electron from the chlorophyll is an oxidation reaction. The chlorophyll donates the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediates called an [[electron transport chain]]. The charged reaction center of chlorophyll (P680<sup>+</sup>) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water. The electron that reduces P680<sup>+</sup> ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O<sub>2</sub> gas, and is the source for practically all the O<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700<sup>+</sup> of Photosystem I is usually reduced as it accepts the electron, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons coming, ultimately, from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700<sup>+</sup> can vary.\n\nThe electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to pump H<sup>+</sup> ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] potential used mainly in the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (stored chemical energy) or to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to [[NADPH]]. NADPH is a universal [[redox|agent]] used to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> into sugars as well as other biosynthetic reactions.\n\nReaction center chlorophyll\u2013protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other chlorophyll pigments, but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small. Thus, the other chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment proteins all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll ''a'', there are other pigments, called [[accessory pigment]]s, which occur in these pigment\u2013protein antenna complexes.\n\n==Chemical structure==\n[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll{{ns|1}}''a'' molecule]]\nChlorophylls are numerous in types, but all are defined by the presence of a fifth ring beyond the four pyrrole-like rings.  Most chlorophylls are classified as [[chlorin]]s, which are reduced relatives to [[porphyrins]] (found in [[hemoglobin]]).  They share a common biosynthetic pathway as porphyrins, including the precursor [[uroporphyrinogen III]].  Unlike hemes, which feature iron at the center of the [[tetrapyrrole]] ring, chlorophylls bind  [[magnesium]]. For the structures depicted in this article, some of the [[ligand]]s attached to the Mg<sup>2+</sup> center are omitted for clarity. The chlorin ring can have various side chains, usually including a long [[phytol]] chain.

In [[Angiosperm]] plants, the last step, the conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent and such plants are pale ([[etiolation|etiolated]]) if grown in darkness. [[Non-vascular plant]]s and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green even in darkness.\n\nChlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a [[photosensitizer]], forming highly toxic [[free radicals]]. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| author1=Meskauskiene R |author2=Nater M |author3=Goslings D |author4=Kessler F |author5=op den Camp R |author6=Apel K. | date = 23 October 2001\n| title = FLU: A negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana\n| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]\n| volume = 98\n| issue = 22\n| pages = 12826\u201312831\n| jstor=3056990\n| doi =10.1073/pnas.221252798\n| pmid = 11606728| pmc = 60138\n|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9812826M }}</ref>\n\n{{Further|Chlorosis}}\nChlorosis is a condition in which [[leaf|leaves]] produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]] \u2014 called iron chlorosis \u2014 or by a shortage of [[magnesium deficiency (plants)|magnesium]] or [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen]]. Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| author = Duble, Richard L.\n| title = Iron Chlorosis in Turfgrass\n| publisher = [[Texas A&M University]]\n| url = http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/turf/iron.html\n| accessdate = 2010-07-17\n}}</ref> Chlorosis can also be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungal infections, or sap-sucking insects.\n\n== Complementary light absorbance of anthocyanins with chlorophylls ==\n[[File:Spectra Chlorophyll ab oenin (1).PNG|thumb|right| Superposition of spectra of chlorophyll a and b with [[oenin]] (malvidin 3O glucoside), a typical [[anthocyanidin]], showing that, while chlorophylls absorb in the blue and yellow/red parts of the visible spectrum, oenin absorbs mainly in the green part of the spectrum, where chlorophylls don't absorb at all.]]\n[[Anthocyanin]]s are other [[plant pigment]]s.

Places where chlorophyll amounts were very low, indicating very low numbers of [[phytoplankton]], are blue. Places where chlorophyll concentrations were high, meaning many phytoplankton were growing, are yellow. The observations come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite. Land is dark gray, and places where MODIS could not collect data because of sea ice, polar darkness, or clouds are light gray.The highest chlorophyll concentrations, where tiny surface-dwelling ocean plants are [[thriving]], are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface, such as around the equator and along the shores of continents. It is not the cold water itself that stimulates the phytoplankton. Instead, the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has welled up to the surface from deeper in the ocean, carrying nutrients that have built up over time. In polar waters, nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants cannot grow. When sunlight returns in the spring and summer, the plants flourish in high concentrations.<ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MY1DMM_CHLORA Chlorophyll : Global Maps].

Carotenes contain no oxygen atoms. They absorb ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light.\n\nCarotenes are responsible for the orange colour of the [[carrot]], for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits, vegetables and fungi (for example, [[sweet potato]]es, [[chanterelle]] and orange [[cantaloupe]] melon). Carotenes are also responsible for the orange (but not all of the yellow) colours in dry foliage. They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids have yellowed-coloured body fat, as a result of the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet. The typical yellow-coloured fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of carotenes from their diets.\n\nCarotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they absorb to [[chlorophyll]]. They also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb the energy from [[singlet oxygen]], an excited form of the oxygen molecule O<sub>2</sub> which is formed during photosynthesis.\n\n[[Beta-Carotene|\u03b2-Carotene]] is composed of two [[retinol|retinyl]] groups, and is broken down in the [[mucosa]] of the human [[small intestine]] by [[\u03b2-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] to [[retinal]], a form of [[vitamin A]]. \u03b2-Carotene can be stored in the [[liver]] and body fat and converted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of vitamin A for humans and some other mammals. The carotenes [[alpha-Carotene|\u03b1-carotene]] and [[gamma-Carotene|\u03b3-carotene]], due to their single retinyl group (\u03b2-[[ionone]] ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than \u03b2-carotene), as does the [[xanthophyll]] carotenoid \u03b2-[[cryptoxanthin]]. All other carotenoids, including [[lycopene]], have no beta-ring and thus '''no''' vitamin A activity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways).\n\nAnimal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl (beta-[[ionone]]) containing carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids. Pure carnivores such as [[ferret]]s lack \u03b2-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all (resulting in carotenes '''not''' being a form of vitamin A for this species); while cats can convert a trace of \u03b2-carotene to retinol, although the amount is totally insufficient for meeting their daily retinol needs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Green AS, Tang G, Lango J, Klasing KC, Fascetti AJ |title=Domestic cats convert ((2) H(8))-\u03b2-carotene to ((2) H(4))-retinol following a single oral dose |journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition |year=2011 |pmid=21797934 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.2011.01196.x |pages=681\u201392 |volume=96 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\n==Molecular structure==\nChemically, carotenes are polyunsaturated [[hydrocarbon]]s containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable numbers of hydrogen atoms, and no other elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of [[conjugated double bond]]s. Structurally carotenes are [[tetraterpene]]s, meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon [[terpene]] units, which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon [[isoprene]] units.\n\nCarotenes are found in plants in two primary forms designated by characters from the [[Greek alphabet]]: [[alpha-Carotene|alpha-carotene]] (\u03b1-carotene) and [[beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] (\u03b2-carotene). [[gamma-Carotene|Gamma-]], [[delta-Carotene|delta-]], [[epsilon-Carotene|epsilon-]], and [[zeta-Carotene|zeta-carotene]] (\u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other [[carotenoid]]s, the [[xanthophyll]]s, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).\n\n==Dietary sources==\nThe following foods are particularly rich in carotenes<ref name=lpi>{{cite web | author = Linus Pauling Institute | title = Micronutrient Information Center: Carotenoids |publisher=Oregon State University | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/carotenoids/\n|date= June 2009 | accessdate = February 15, 2010}}</ref> (also see [[Vitamin A]] article for amounts):\n{{Div col}}\n*[[sweet potato]]es<ref name=whfoods>[http://www.whfoods.org/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=125 What can foods rich in beta-carotene do for you?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626174921/http://www.whfoods.org/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=125 |date=June 26, 2007 }}.

Carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as [[xanthophyll]]s.\n\nThe two ends of the \u03b2-carotene molecule are structurally identical, and are called '''\u03b2-rings'''.

There is no such thing as an \"\u03b1-ring\".\n\nThese and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme, according to which:\n* \u03b1-carotene is '''\u03b2,\u03b5-carotene''';\n* \u03b2-carotene is '''\u03b2,\u03b2-carotene''';\n* \u03b3-carotene (with one \u03b2 ring and one uncyclized end that is labelled ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'') is '''\u03b2,\u03c8-carotene''';\n* \u03b4-carotene (with one \u03b5 ring and one uncyclized end) is '''\u03b5,\u03c8-carotene''';\n* \u03b5-carotene is '''\u03b5,\u03b5-carotene'''\n* [[lycopene]] is '''\u03c8,\u03c8-carotene'''\n\n\u03b6-Carotene is the [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[neurosporene]], which is the precursor of lycopene, which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes \u03b1 through \u03b5.\n\n==Food additive==\nCarotene is also used as a substance to colour products such as juice, cakes, desserts, butter and margarine.

PKA is normally inactive as a tetrameric [[holoenzyme]], consisting of two [[catalysis|catalytic]] and two regulatory units (C<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>), with the regulatory units blocking the catalytic centers of the catalytic units.\n\nCyclic AMP binds to specific locations on the regulatory units of the protein kinase, and causes dissociation between the regulatory and catalytic subunits, thus enabling those catalytic units to [[phosphorylate]] substrate proteins.\n\nThe active subunits catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. The phosphorylated proteins may act directly on the cell's ion channels, or may become activated or inhibited enzymes. Protein kinase A can also phosphorylate specific proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA, causing increases in transcription. Not all protein kinases respond to cAMP. Several classes of [[protein kinase]]s, including protein kinase C, are not cAMP-dependent.\n\nFurther effects mainly depend on [[function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase|cAMP-dependent protein kinase]], which vary based on the type of cell.\n\nStill, there are some minor PKA-independent functions of cAMP, e.g., activation of [[calcium channel]]s, providing a minor pathway by which [[growth hormone-releasing hormone]] causes a release of [[growth hormone]].<ref name=GeneGlobe>[https://www1.qiagen.com/GeneGlobe/PathwayView.aspx?pathwayID=199 GeneGlobe -> GHRH Signaling]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on May 31, 2009</ref>\n\nHowever, the view that the majority of the effects of cAMP are controlled by PKA is an outdated one. In 1998 a family of cAMP-sensitive proteins with [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] (GEF) activity was discovered. These are termed Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) and the family comprises [[RAPGEF3|Epac1]] and [[RAPGEF4|Epac2]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bos|first1=Johannes L.|title=Epac proteins: multi-purpose cAMP targets|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=December 2006|volume=31|issue=12|pages=680\u2013686|doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2006.10.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000406002921}}</ref> The mechanism of activation is similar to that of PKA: the GEF domain is usually masked by the N-terminal region containing the cAMP binding domain. When cAMP binds, the domain dissociates and exposes the now-active GEF domain, allowing Epac to activate small Ras-like GTPase proteins, such as [[Rap1]].\n\n==== Additional role of secreted cAMP in social amoebas ====\n{{See also|Fungal behavior}}\nIn the species ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', cAMP acts outside the cell as a secreted signal.  The [[chemotaxis|chemotactic]] aggregation of cells is organized by periodic waves of cAMP that propagate between cells over distances as large as several centimetres. The waves are the result of a regulated production and secretion of extracellular cAMP and a spontaneous biological oscillator that initiates the waves at centers of territories.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Role in bacteria ===\nIn [[bacteria]], the level of cAMP varies depending on the medium used for growth.  In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source.  This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylate cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell.  The transcription factor [[cAMP receptor protein]] (CRP) also called [[Catabolite activator protein|CAP (catabolite gene activator protein)]] forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA.  CRP-cAMP increases expression of a large number of genes, including some encoding [[enzyme]]s that can supply energy independent of glucose.\n\ncAMP, for example, is involved in the positive regulation of the [[lac operon]]. In an environment with a low glucose concentration, cAMP accumulates and binds to the allosteric site on CRP ([[cAMP receptor protein]]), a transcription activator protein. The protein assumes its active shape and binds to a specific site upstream of the lac promoter, making it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the adjacent promoter to start transcription of the lac operon, increasing the rate of lac operon transcription. With a high glucose concentration, the cAMP concentration decreases, and the CRP disengages from the lac operon.\n\n==Pathology==\nSince cyclic AMP is a second messenger and plays vital role in cell signalling, it has been implicated in various disorders but not restricted to the roles given below:\n=== Role in human carcinoma ===\nSome research has suggested that a deregulation of cAMP pathways and an aberrant activation of cAMP-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers.<ref>[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/1338 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP-responsive Genes and Tumor Progression)]</ref><ref>[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/19/9483 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP Dysregulation and Melonoma)]</ref><ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/201 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP-binding Proteins' Presence in Tumors)]</ref>\n\n=== Role in prefrontal cortex disorders ===\nRecent research suggests that cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the [[prefrontal cortex]] through its regulation of ion channels called [[hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels]] (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, closing the brain cell to communication and thus interfering with the function of the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This research, especially the cognitive deficits in age-related illnesses and ADHD, is of interest to researchers studying the brain.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070420143324.htm ScienceDaily ::Brain Networks Strengthened By Closing Ion Channels, Research Could Lead To ADHD Treatment ]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP)\n* [[8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate]] (8-Br-cAMP)\n* [[Acrasin]] specific to chemotactic use in ''Dictyostelium discoideum''.\n* [[phosphodiesterase 4]] (PDE 4) which degrades cAMP\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\n Image:CAMP.PNG|cAMP represented in three ways\n Image:ATP chemical structure.png|[[Adenosine triphosphate]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Intracellular signaling peptides and proteins}}\n{{Nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate}}\n[[Category:Nucleotides]]\n[[Category:Signal transduction]]\n[[Category:Cell signaling]]\n[[Category:Cyclic nucleotides]]", "sha1": "3p52hreiepm12i4gkrtramfytr4qkq4"}}, {"title": "Channel Islands/Jersey", "ns": "0", "id": "6989", "redirect": {"title": "Jersey"}, "revision": {"id": "430148458", "parentid": "93159023", "timestamp": "2011-05-21T05:25:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:Channel Islands/Jersey]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Jersey]]", "sha1": "6u95aazkw5mtjpiax6wm9u3zt72xj07"}}, {"title": "Cimabue", "ns": "0", "id": "6991", "revision": {"id": "865290146", "parentid": "865290039", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T00:01:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Theinstantmatrix", "id": "31567860"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/2604:2000:DD46:3500:559F:8047:4A28:9E66|2604:2000:DD46:3500:559F:8047:4A28:9E66]] ([[User talk:2604:2000:DD46:3500:559F:8047:4A28:9E66|talk]]) to last version by Modernist", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Cimabue - Maest\u00e0 di Santa Trinita - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Maest\u00e0 di [[Santa Trinita]]'', 1280\u20131285, [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]], [[Florence]].]]\n'''Cimabue''' ({{IPA-it|t\u0283ima\u02c8bu\u02d0e}}; {{IPA-la|t\u0361\u0283i\u02c8ma\u02d0.bu.e|church}}; {{c.}} 1240 \u2013 1302),<ref name=vas>[[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari, G]].

January 11, 2010).</ref> Corporatization, in his view, is the antithesis of free market capitalism.  It is characterized by semi-monopolistic organizations and banks, big employer confederations, often acting with complicit state institutions in ways that discourage (or block) the natural workings of a free economy.  The primary effects of corporatization are the consolidation of economic power and wealth, with end results being the attrition of entrepreneurial and free market dynamism.\n\nHis follow-up book, ''Mass Flourishing'', further defines corporatization by the following attributes: power-sharing between government and large corporations (exemplified in the U.S. by widening government power in areas such as financial services, healthcare, energy, law enforcement/[[Private prison|prison systems]], and the [[Private military company|military]] through regulation and outsourcing), an expansion of corporate lobbying and campaign support in exchange for government reciprocity, escalation in the growth and influence of financial and banking sectors, increased consolidation of the corporate landscape through merger and acquisition (with ensuing increases in corporate executive compensation), increased potential for corporate/government corruption and malfeasance, and a lack of entrepreneurial and small business development leading to lethargic and stagnant economic conditions.<ref name=\"Princeton University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Phelps|first1=Edmund|title=Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change|date=August 25, 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691158983|page=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Flourishing-Grassroots-Innovation-Challenge/dp/0691158983}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579066790248178438|title=Book Review: 'Mass Flourishing' by Edmund Phelps|author=Edward Glaeser|date=18 October 2013|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n[[File:U.S. Compensation as Percent of GDP - v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Labor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2013, measured based on total compensation as well as salaries and wages.

With regard to income inequality, the 2014 income analysis of [[University of California, Berkeley]] economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] confirms that relative growth of income and wealth is not occurring among small and mid-sized entrepreneurs and business owners (who generally populate the lower half of top one per-centers in income),<ref>[https://thecfoalliance.org/documents/CFO_Alliance_Executive_Compensation_Survey_Presentation_Final_1_10_2013.pdf The CFO Alliance Executive Compensation Survey 2013]</ref> but instead only among the top .1 percent of income distribution ... whom Economics Nobel  Prize winner, Paul Krugman describes as \"super-elites \u2013 corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/opinion/we-are-the-99-9.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&ref=opinion&adxnnlx=1413381816-Gy6K3nXHunUOH3N8AnSa7Q We Are The 99.9%, Paul Krugman, New York Times, November 24, 2011.]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/how-you-i-and-everyone-got-the-top-1-percent-all-wrong/359862/|title=How You, I, and Everyone Got the Top 1 Percent All Wrong|author=Derek Thompson|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>... who earn $2,000,000 or more every year.<ref name=\"gabriel-zucman.eu\">[http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014Slides.pdf The Distribution of US Wealth, Capital Income and Returns since 1913, Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman], March 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2013/11/25/are-you-rich-enough-the-terrible-tragedy-of-income-inequality-among-the-1/|title=Are You Rich Enough?

Nobel Prize winner of Economics, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in May 2011: \"Much of today\u2019s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself\u2014one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest.\" Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly \"one-quarter\" of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105|title=Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeasured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends|title=Monetary policy and long-term trends|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Wages and salaries have fallen from approximately 51% GDP in 1970 to 43% GDP in 2013.{{update-inline|date=October 2018}} Total compensation has fallen from approximately 58% GDP in 1970 to 53% GDP in 2013.{{update-inline|date=October 2018}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=205101&updated=1530|title=FRED Graph|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>{{obsolete source|date=October 2018}}\n\nTo put this in perspective,{{editorializing|date=October 2018}} five percent of U.S. GDP was approximately $850 billion in 2013. This represents an additional $7,000 in compensation for each of the 120 million U.S. households. [[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution (a period of much greater equality), or approximately $7,000 per family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/|title=Harness market forces to share prosperity |author=Larry Summers|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nNot receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007\u20132009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.<ref name=\"Mian and Sufi2014\">{{cite book\n| last = Mian, Atif and\n| first = Sufi, Amir\n| year = 2014\n| title = [[House of Debt]] | publisher = University of Chicago\n| isbn = 978-0-226-08194-6}}</ref>\n\n===Effective corporate tax rates===\n[[File:U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Receipts and Pre-Tax Profits.png|thumb|right|400px|U.S. corporate effective tax rates have fallen significantly since the year 2000.]]\nAs another indication of U.S. corporate political influence, U.S. corporate effective tax rates have also fallen significantly, from 29% in 2000 to 17% in 2013.

About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Tax Inversion|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===\nOne indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate [[share repurchase|stock buybacks]] for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality.  Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock.  An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor.  He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1|title=Profits Without Prosperity|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-in-corporations-its-owner-take-all/2014/08/26/0c1a002a-2ca7-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html|title=In corporations, it\u2019s owner-take-all|author=Harold Meyerson|date=26 August 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef626fc4-f6f7-11e3-b271-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IVLb48yU|title=US share buybacks and dividends hit record|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014.

It\u2019s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity.\"<ref name=Brennan2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/state-corporate-power|title=The State of Corporate Power|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/briefing/state-power-2014|title=State of Power 2014|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn example of such industry concentration is in banking. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB|title=5-Bank Asset Concentration for United States|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[The Economist]] also explained how an increasingly profitable corporate financial and banking sector caused Gini coefficients to rise in the U.S. since 1980: \"Financial services' share of GDP in America doubled to 8% between 1980 and 2000; over the same period their profits rose from about 10% to 35% of total corporate profits, before collapsing in 2007\u201309. Bankers are being paid more, too. In America the compensation of workers in financial services was similar to average compensation until 1980. Now it is twice that average.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17957381|title=Unbottled Gini|work=The Economist|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe summary argument, considering these findings, is that if corporatization is the consolidation and sharing of economic and political power between large corporations and the state ... then a corresponding concentration of income and wealth (with resulting income inequality) is an expected by-product of such a consolidation.<ref name=Brennan2014/>\n\n===Corporate influence on legislation===\n{{main|Regulatory capture}}\nCorporations have significant influence on the regulations and regulators that monitor them. For example, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] explained in December 2014 how an omnibus spending bill required to fund the government was modified late in the process to weaken banking regulations. The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking \"swaps entities\", which the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] banking regulations prohibited. She singled out [[Citigroup]], one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also explained how both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt's warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the \"very foundations of Democracy.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpTxONxvoo&feature=youtu.be|title=Remarks by Senator Warren on Citigroup and its bailout provision|date=12 December 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Historical corporatocracies ==\n[[File:American corporate flag.jpg|thumb|Protester holding [[Adbusters]] Corporate American Flag at Bush's 2nd inauguration, [[Washington DC.]]]]\nSeveral companies that typify corporatocracy power structures are listed below by incorporation date:\n\n===Indian Subcontinent===\n* 1600: [[Company rule in India]] by the British East India Company\n* 1602: [[Dutch East India Company]]\n* 1616: [[Danish East India Company]]\n* 1664: [[French East India Company]]\n\n===Caribbean===\n* 1621: [[Dutch West India Company]]\n* 1671: [[Danish West India Company]]\n* 1674: [[French West India Company]]\n\n===North America===\n* 1670: The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] which operated as not only a monopoly, but the de facto government, in parts of North America which would later become Canada and the United States\n\n===Africa===\n* 1672: [[Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]]\n* 1879: [[International Association of the Congo]]\n* 1889: [[Company rule in Rhodesia]] by the British South Africa Company\n\n===Central America===\n* 1899: [[United Fruit Company]] (which later became [[Chiquita Brands International]]), operating as a [[banana republic]] in [[Guatemala]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Honduras]]\n* 1924: [[Standard Fruit Company]] (which later became [[Dole Food Company]]), operating as a [[banana republic]] in [[Honduras]] and other countries\n\n==Voting rights==\nCorporations have held the right to vote in some jurisdictions.

probability distribution]].  It is also known, especially among [[physicist]]s, as the '''Lorentz distribution''' (after [[Hendrik Lorentz]]), '''Cauchy\u2013Lorentz distribution''', '''Lorentz(ian) function''', or '''Breit\u2013Wigner distribution'''.  The Cauchy distribution <math>f(x; x_0,\\gamma)</math> is the distribution of the ''x''-intercept of a ray issuing from <math>(x_0,\\gamma)</math> with a uniformly distributed angle.  It is also the distribution of the [[Ratio distribution|ratio of two]] independent [[Normal Distribution | normally distributed]] random variables if the denominator distribution has mean zero.\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a \"[[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]\" distribution since both its [[expected value]] and its [[variance]] are undefined. (But see the section ''[[#Explanation of undefined moments|Explanation of undefined moments]]'' below.) The Cauchy distribution does not have finite [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of order greater than or equal to one; only fractional absolute moments exist.<ref name=jkb1>{{cite book|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=N. Balakrishnan |title=Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1994|ref=harv}}, Chapter 16.</ref> The Cauchy distribution has no [[moment generating function]].\n\nIn [[mathematics]], it is closely related to the [[Poisson kernel]], which is the [[fundamental solution]] for the [[Laplace equation]] in the [[upper half-plane]].  In [[spectroscopy]], it is the description of the shape of [[spectral line]]s which are subject to [[homogeneous broadening]] in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably [[Line broadening#Pressure broadening|collision broadening]].<ref>{{cite book |author=E. Hecht |year=1987 |title=Optics |page=603 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIt is one of the few distributions that is [[stable distribution|stable]] and has a probability density function that can be expressed analytically, the others being the [[normal distribution]] and the [[L\u00e9vy distribution]].\n\n==History==\nFunctions with the form of the density function of the Cauchy distribution were studied by mathematicians in the 17th century, but in a different context and under the title of the [[witch of Agnesi]]. Despite its name, the first explicit analysis of the properties of the Cauchy distribution was published by the French mathematician [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] in 1824, with Cauchy only becoming associated with it during an academic controversy in 1853.<ref>Cauchy and the Witch of Agnesi in ''Statistics on the Table'', S M Stigler Harvard 1999 Chapter 18</ref> As such, the name of the distribution is a case of [[Stigler's law of eponymy|Stigler's Law of Eponymy]]. Poisson noted that if the mean of observations following such a distribution were taken, the mean error did not converge to any finite number. As such, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace's]] use of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] with such a distribution was inappropriate, as it assumed a finite mean and variance. Despite this, Poisson did not regard the issue as important, in contrast to [[Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e-Jules Bienaym\u00e9|Bienaym\u00e9]], who was to engage Cauchy in a long dispute over the matter.\n\n==Characterisation==\n\n===Probability density function===\nThe Cauchy distribution has the [[probability density function]] (PDF)<ref name=jkb1/><ref name=feller>{{cite book|last=Feller|first=William|title=An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Volume II|edition=2|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.|location=New York|year=1971|pages=704|isbn=978-0-471-25709-7}}</ref>\n:<math>f(x; x_0,\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x - x_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2\\right]} = { 1 \\over \\pi \\gamma } \\left[ { \\gamma^2 \\over (x - x_0)^2 + \\gamma^2  } \\right], </math>\n\nwhere <math>x_0</math> is the [[location parameter]], specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[scale parameter]] which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), alternatively <math>2\\gamma</math> is [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). <math>\\gamma</math> is also equal to half the [[interquartile range]] and is sometimes called the [[probable error]].

This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the [[central limit theorem]] cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all [[stable distribution]]s, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is an [[infinitely divisible probability distribution]].

In addition, the Cauchy distribution is closed under [[M\u00f6bius transformation|linear fractional transformations]] with real coefficients.<ref>{{cite journal|author=F. B.

The [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the Cauchy distribution is given by\n\n:<math>\\varphi_X(t; x_0,\\gamma) = \\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{iXt} \\right ] =\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x;x_0,\\gamma)e^{ixt}\\,dx =  e^{ix_0t - \\gamma |t|}.</math>\n\nwhich is just the [[Fourier transform]] of the probability density. The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:\n\n:<math>f(x; x_0,\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_X(t;x_0,\\gamma)e^{-ixt} \\, dt \\!</math>\n\nThe ''n''th moment of a distribution is the ''n''th derivative of the characteristic function evaluated at <math>t=0</math>. Observe that the characteristic function is not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have well-defined moments higher than the zeroth moment.\n\n==Explanation of undefined moments==\n\n===Mean===\nIf a [[probability distribution]] has a [[probability density function|density function]] <math>f(x)</math>, then the mean, if it exists, is given by\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx. \\qquad\\qquad (1)\\!</math>\n\nWe may evaluate this two-sided [[improper integral]] by computing the sum of two one-sided improper integrals. That is,\n:<math>\\int_a^\\infty x f(x)\\,dx+\\int_{-\\infty}^a x f(x)\\,dx.\\qquad\\qquad (2) \\!</math>\nfor an arbitrary real number <math>a</math>.\n\nFor the integral to exist (even as an infinite value), at least one of the terms in this sum should be finite, or both should be infinite and have the same sign. But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the terms in this sum (2) are infinite and have opposite sign. Hence (1) is undefined, and thus so is the mean.<ref name=\"uah\">{{cite web | url=http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/special/Cauchy.html | title=Cauchy Distribution | publisher=[[University of Alabama]] at Huntsville | work=Virtual Laboratories | accessdate=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nNote that the  [[Cauchy principal value]] of the Cauchy distribution is\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!</math>\n\nwhich is zero. On the other hand, the related integral\n:<math>\\lim_{a\\to\\infty}\\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\\,dx, \\!</math>\n\nis ''not'' zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral. This again shows that the mean (1) can not exist.\n\nVarious results in probability theory about [[expected value]]s, such as the [[strong law of large numbers]], fail to hold for the Cauchy distribution.<ref name=\"uah\"/>\n\n===Higher moments===\nThe Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of any order.  Some of the higher [[raw moment]]s do exist and have a value of infinity, for example the raw second moment:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}[X^2] & \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 1 - \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx-\\pi = \\infty.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nBy re-arranging the formula, one can see that the second moment is essentially the infinite integral of a constant (here 1).  Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity.  Odd-powered raw moments, however, are undefined, which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to <math>\\infty - \\infty</math> since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs.  The first raw moment is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the [[central moment]]s and [[standardized moment]]s are undefined, since they are all based on the mean.  The variance\u2014which is the second central moment\u2014is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).\n\nThe results for higher moments follow from [[H\u00f6lder's inequality]], which implies that higher moments (or halves of moments) diverge if lower ones do.\n\n==Estimation of parameters ==\nBecause the parameters of the Cauchy distribution do not correspond to a mean and variance, attempting to estimate the parameters of the Cauchy distribution by using a sample mean and a sample variance will not succeed.<ref>[http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/ee_distri_cauchy.html Illustration of instability of sample means]</ref> For example, if an i.i.d. sample of size ''n'' is taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:\n\n:<math>\\bar{x}=\\frac 1 n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i</math>\n\nAlthough the sample values <math>x_i</math> will be concentrated about the central value <math>x_0</math>, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more observations are taken, because of the increased probability of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the observations themselves; i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of <math>x_0</math> than any single observation from the sample.

Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called [[automatic control]] systems (such as [[cruise control]] for regulating the speed of a car). [[Multi-disciplinary]] in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical model]]ing of a diverse range of [[system]]s.\n\n==Overview==\nModern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the 20th century with the advancement of technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of [[control theory]]. Control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance [[F-16]] fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modelling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; use control systems design tools to develop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s for those systems; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A [[control system|system]] can be [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[fluid]], [[chemical]], [[finance|financial]] or [[biology|biological]], and the mathematical modelling, analysis and controller design uses [[control theory]] in one or many of the [[Time domain|time]], [[frequency domain|frequency]] and [[S domain|complex-s]] domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb| Control of [[fractionating column]]s is one of the more challenging applications]]Automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient [[Ktesibios]]'s [[water clock]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt around the third century B.C.E. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|captured]] the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or \"closed-loop\" automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to [[Cornelis Drebbel|Drebbel]], circa 1620, and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.\n\nIn his 1868 paper \"On Governors\", [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and it signalled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell's analysis.\n\nControl theory made significant strides over the next century. New mathematical techniques, as well as advancements in electronic and computer technologies, made it possible to control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor could stabilize. New mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive, nonlinear, and azid-based control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner automobile engines, and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes.\n\nBefore it emerged as a unique discipline, control engineering was practiced as a part of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[control theory]] was studied as a part of [[electrical engineering]] since [[electrical circuits]] can often be easily described using control theory techniques. In the very first control relationships, a current output was represented by a voltage control input. However, not having adequate technology to implement electrical control systems, designers were left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems. A very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the [[Centrifugal governor|governor]]. Later on, previous to modern [[power electronics]], process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] and [[Hydraulic system|hydraulic]] control devices, many of which are still in use today.\n\n== Control theory ==\n{{main|Control theory}}\n\nThere are two major divisions in control theory, namely, classical and modern, which have direct implications for the control engineering applications. The scope of classical control theory is limited to [[Single-input single-output system|single-input and single-output]] (SISO) system design, except when analyzing for disturbance rejection using a second input. The system analysis is carried out in the time domain using [[differential equations]], in the complex-s domain with the [[Laplace transform]], or in the frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. Many systems may be assumed to have a second order and single variable system response in the time domain. A controller designed using classical theory often requires on-site tuning due to incorrect design approximations. Yet, due to the easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are [[PID controller]]s. A less common implementation may include either or both a Lead or Lag filter. The ultimate end goal is to meet requirements typically provided in the time-domain called the step response, or at times in the frequency domain called the open-loop response. The step response characteristics applied in a specification are typically percent overshoot, settling time, etc. The open-loop response characteristics applied in a specification are typically Gain and Phase margin and bandwidth. These characteristics may be evaluated through simulation including a dynamic model of the system under control coupled with the compensation model.\n\nIn contrast, modern control theory is carried out in the [[state space (controls)|state space]], and can deal with [[Multiple-input multiple-output system|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO) systems. This overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems, such as fighter aircraft control, with the limitation that no frequency domain analysis is possible. In modern design, a system is represented to the greatest advantage as a set of decoupled first order [[differential equation]]s defined using [[state variables]]. [[Nonlinear control|Nonlinear]], [[multivariable control|multivariable]], [[adaptive control|adaptive]] and [[robust control]] theories come under this division. Matrix methods are significantly limited for MIMO systems where linear independence cannot be assured in the relationship between inputs and outputs. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like [[Rudolf E. Kalman]] and [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] are well-known among the people who have shaped modern control theory.\n\n== Control systems ==\nControl engineering is the engineering [[discipline]] that focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic systems]] (e.g. [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[system]]s) and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controller]]s that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.  Although such controllers need not be electrical, many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering.  However, the falling price of microprocessors is making the actual implementation of a control system essentially trivial{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.  As a result, focus is shifting back to the mechanical and process engineering discipline, as intimate knowledge of the physical system being controlled is often desired.\n\n[[Electrical circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s can all be used to implement [[control system]]s. Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s. \n\nIn most cases, control engineers utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. This is often accomplished using a [[PID controller]] system. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system, which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[torque]] accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. In practically all such systems [[stability theory|stability]] is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved.\n\nAlthough feedback is an important aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as [[open loop control]]. A classic example of [[open loop control]] is a [[washing machine]] that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of [[sensor]]s.\n\n== Control engineering education ==\nAt many universities around the world, control engineering courses are taught primarily in [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]], but some courses can be instructed in [[mechatronics engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[aerospace engineering]]. In others, control engineering is connected to [[computer science]], as most control techniques today are implemented through computers, often as [[embedded systems]] (as in the automotive field). The field of control within [[chemical engineering]] is often known as [[process control]]. It deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant. It is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program and employs many of the same principles in control engineering. Other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived. However, specialised control engineering departments do exist, for example, the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse|website=|title=ACSE - The University of Sheffield|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> and the Department of Systems Engineering at the United States Naval Academy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/WSE/|website=USNA Weapons and Systems Engineering|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nControl engineering has diversified applications that include science, finance management, and even human behavior.  Students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain, which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and [[Laplace transform]], called classical control theory.  In linear control, the student does frequency and time domain analysis.  [[Digital control]] and [[nonlinear control]] courses require [[Z transform]]ation and algebra respectively, and could be said to complete a basic control education.\n\n== Recent advancement ==\nOriginally, control engineering was all about continuous systems. Development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a [[computer clock]]. The equivalent to [[Laplace transform]] in the discrete domain is the [[Z-transform]]. Today, many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components.\n\nTherefore, at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain, or analog components are mapped into discrete domain and design is carried out there. The first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components, including mechanical, fluid, biological and analog electrical components, with a few digital controllers.\n\nSimilarly, the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to [[computer-aided design]] and now to [[computer-automated design]] or CAutoD which has been made possible by [[evolutionary computation]]. CAutoD can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme, but also to controller structure optimisation, system identification and invention of novel control systems, based purely upon a performance requirement, independent of any specific control scheme.<ref>Tan, K.C. and Li, Y.

For example, intracellular [[amastigote]]s destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.<ref name=emed/>\n\n==Transmission==\n[[File:Rhodnius prolixus70-300.jpg|thumb|''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' is the principal vector in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and some parts of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]].]]\n\n===Main methods===\nIn Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] called a [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug.<ref name=CDC/> A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.<ref name=CDC/>\n\nThe bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as \"kissing bugs\". After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound.<ref name=CDC/>\n\nScratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s.

His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, pages 48-49, Barnard's work remedying intestinal atresia\"/>  In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by [[Owen Harding Wangensteen]].<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, page 51\"/>  He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer [[C.

Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.<ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/><ref name=Science-Museum-patient-Louis-Washkansky/>  Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.<ref name=\"Calculated-Risks-Gerd-Gigerenzer-2002\"/><ref name=\"Companion-To-Bioethics-Second-Edition-2012\"/><ref name=\"Barnard stating to Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky 80% of success, in Every Second Counts, by Donald McRae\"/>\n\nBarnard's second transplant patient [[Philip Blaiberg]], with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.<ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/><ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Philip-Blaiberg-1968/>\n\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted ''[[Glycel]]'', an expensive \"anti-aging\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the [[Christiaan Barnard Foundation]], dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\n\n== Early life ==\nBarnard grew up in [[Beaufort West]], [[Cape Province]], [[Union of South Africa]]. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa|Dutch Reformed Church]].<ref name=\"mcrae2006\"/> One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \"blue baby\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was [[tetralogy of Fallot]]).  The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.<ref>''Every Second Counts'', McRae [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=%22Chris+and+Marius+often+felt+that+she+was+grieving+over+the+loss+of+her+only+daughter%22&source=bl&ots=0sfG2pL-b5&sig=AHk7xZK5s6ocBHV7gUmxq6fKvao&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ-8GRvO_RAhUnw1QKHS1rDakQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Chris%20and%20Marius%20often%20felt%20that%20she%20was%20grieving%20over%20the%20loss%20of%20her%20only%20daughter%22&f=false page 46].</ref> Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the [[University of Cape Town]] [[Medical School]], where he obtained his [[MBChB|MB ChB]] in 1945.\n\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples.  His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.<ref name=New-York-Times-2001-obituary-Christiaan-Barnard/>\n\n==Career==\nBarnard did his [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and [[residency (medicine)|residency]] at the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]], after which he worked as a general practitioner in [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]], a rural town in the Cape Province.<ref name=\"mcrae2006\">''Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart'', [[Donald McRae (author)|Donald McRae]], New York: Penguin (Berkley/Putnam), 2006.  See esp. Ch. 10 \"The Wait\" and Ch. 11 \"Fame and Heartbreak,\" pages 173\u2013214.</ref> In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.<ref name=\"mcrae2006\"/> He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\".\n\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines.  He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus.  After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia.  He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply.  The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply.  To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches).  Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town.  This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US.  In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, pages 48-49, Barnard's work remedying intestinal atresia\">''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&pg=PT45&lpg=PT45&dq=%22Soon+after+qualifying+as+a+doctor,+Barnard+produced+a+staggering+piece+of+experimental+research%22&source=bl&ots=0sfG1rO1f1&sig=nA43OxSj7yF1KpnylXq1K8yOp8Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIkrSVnu3RAhUJxmMKHXvEB_QQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Soon%20after%20qualifying%20as%20a%20doctor%2C%20Barnard%20produced%20a%20staggering%20piece%20of%20experimental%20research%22&f=false pages 48\u201349].</ref>  \n\nOwen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota.  He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, page 49, Barnard goes to Minnesota\">''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&pg=PT47&dq=%22In+December+1955,+Christiaan+Barnard+flew+to+the+city+of+snow%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiK3vTLo5DSAhVDMGMKHalQCt4Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20December%201955%2C%20Christiaan%20Barnard%20flew%20to%20the%20city%20of%20snow%22&f=false page 49].</ref>  In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis]], United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, page 51\">''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&pg=PT48&lpg=PT48&dq=%22Wangensteen+considered+gastrointestinal+research+to+be+intellectually+delicious%22&source=bl&ots=0sfI2oM_g3&sig=jPUPhhkvTYfmK5dlqON8uzv_nas&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi67cj_tKnSAhVIwWMKHVSsAZIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Wangensteen%20considered%20gastrointestinal%20research%20to%20be%20intellectually%20delicious%22&f=false page 51].</ref>  Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with [[Vince Gott]] who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer [[C. Walton Lillehei|Walt Lillehei]].  Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\").  In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.<ref name=\"Every Second Counts, page 53, Barnard meets Vince Gott\">''Every Second Counts'', McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Fv9dRT9TC4C&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq=%22Whenever+he+needed+a+break+from+the+gullet,+Barnard+wandered+across+the+hall%22&source=bl&ots=0sfI2oPW86&sig=_mVcwW7qo08i8kXim2ERnySlu9k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwja28myvqnSAhVQ42MKHeTSBgsQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Whenever%20he%20needed%20a%20break%20from%20the%20gullet%2C%20Barnard%20wandered%20across%20the%20hall%22&f=false page 53].</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service.

(The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.)

Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions.  For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs.  Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \"piggy back\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \"double heart\".  Barnard performed the first such [[Heart transplantation#Heterotopic procedure|heterotopic]] heart transplant in 1974.<ref name=\"South-African-Medical-Journal-2012\"/><ref name=\"Postgrad-Medical-Journal-2016\">[http://pmj.bmj.com/content/early/2016/07/27/postgradmedj-2016-134309.extract \"A tale of two hearts\"], ''Postgrad Medical Journal'', 27 July 2016.  \"...  HHT [Heterotopic Heart Transplantation] involves transplanting the donor heart without removing the recipient heart, effectively forming a 'double heart'.  It was widely used in the pre-cyclosporine era when the donor was not strong enough (eg, the recipient had a much larger body) or the recipient had pre-existing pulmonary hypertension.  Christiaan Barnard performed the first HHT ('piggy back' transplant) in 1974 ...\"</ref>\n\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.<ref name=\"South-African-Medical-Journal-2012\"/>\n\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to [[Transplant rejection|rejection of the transplanted heart]] by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of [[ciclosporin|cyclosporine]], an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted [[xenotransplantation]] in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\n\n== Public life ==\n[[File:Christiaan Barnard 1968.jpg|thumb|Christiaan Barnard in Italy in 1968]]\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law.

The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious or professional prohibitions (for example Roman soldiers), or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities. The woman or man in such a relationship is referred to as a '''concubine''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u0252|\u014b|k|j|\u1d7f|\u02cc|b|a\u026a|n}}), and occasionally so is a man in such a relationship.\n\nThe prevalence of concubinage and the status of rights and expectations of a concubine have varied among cultures, as have the rights of children of a concubine. Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. Historically, concubinage was frequently entered into voluntarily (by the woman or her family) as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman. Involuntary or servile concubinage sometimes involved sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, usually the woman. Nevertheless, sexual relations outside marriage were not uncommon, especially among royalty and nobility, and the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even when there was an absence of legitimate heirs.\n\nWhile forms of long-term sexual relationships and [[co-habitation]] short of marriage have become increasingly common in the Western world, these are generally not described as concubinage. The terms concubinage and concubine are used today primarily when referring to non-marital partnerships of earlier eras. In modern usage, a non-marital domestic relationship is commonly referred to as co-habitation (or similar terms), and the woman in such a relationship is generally referred to as a [[girlfriend]], [jig-a-low], [bastard] [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], [[fianc\u00e9e]], lover or [[life partner]].\n\n==In Asia==\nConcubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over Asia. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].\n\n===China===\n[[File:\u300a\u4e07\u56fd\u6765\u671d\u56fe\u300b\u4e4b\u4e7e\u9686\u540e\u5983.jpg|thumb|Consorts and children of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], [[Qing dynasty]], 18th century]]\n[[File:The Fourth Concubine of Hexing.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a concubine, by Chinese painter [[Lam Qua]], 1864]]\nIn China, [[Women in ancient and imperial China|successful men often had concubines]] until the practice was outlawed when the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was ''qi\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u59be}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference))\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=\u5a62\u59be|p=b\u00ec qi\u00e8}}) are of lower status, and their children are considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''p\u00ednf\u0113i'' ({{zh|t=\u5b2a\u5983}}), or \"consorts of emperors\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''.

From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25\u2013220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.<ref>Shi Fengyi \u53f2\u51e4\u4eea (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating \u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u5a5a\u59fb\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead ''Marriage and Family in Ancient China''.

In the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' chapter on \"The Pattern of the Family\" ({{zh|t=\u5167\u5247}}) it says, \u201cIf there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|title=Nei Ze|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051012/http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Wives brought a [[dowry]] to a relationship, but concubines did not.

Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife's children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children.

It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2002: 60\"/>\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.<ref name=\"Concubines of Ancient China\"/> In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368-1644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16.

Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became [[Tongzhi Emperor]].

In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to make her fall in love with him again at her father\u2019s house; he brings a servant and two asses to show off what glory he has. Her father seeks to keep him there until one day he refuses to remain and leaves. He is offered hospitality at Gibeah. The way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure. The Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womenfolk, both the host\u2019s virgin daughter and his companion\u2019s concubine, to their aggressors for sex in exchange for their own safety. In the morning, the Levite tries to wake her up, but then realizes that she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel to remind them of the blessing that God gave them of liberating them from the likewise sexually vicious and sadistic land of Egypt, and to inform them of the horribleness of the land of Gibeah. The sadistic rape of the concubine is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.\n\n====In modern Judaism====\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d2\u05e9}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c2}},<ref>Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994</ref><ref>Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999</ref><ref>Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002</ref> meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] (\"formal betrothal\"). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" />\n\nCertain Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines were strictly reserved for Royal leadership, kings and queens, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]\"&mdash;i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations&mdash;regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>\n\n===In Islam===\n{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}\n{{See also|Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse}}\n{{POV section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:V.M.

It is the third tallest tower in the city after [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|2 International Finance Centre]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and the [[International Commerce Centre|ICC]] in [[West Kowloon]]. It was the tallest building in Asia from 1992 to 1996, until the [[Shun Hing Square]] was built in [[Shenzhen]], a neighbouring city. Central Plaza surpassed the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] as the [[List of tallest buildings in Hong Kong|tallest building in Hong Kong]] until the completion of [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|2 IFC]].\n\nCentral Plaza was also the tallest [[reinforced concrete]] building in the world, until it was surpassed by [[CITIC Plaza]], [[Guangzhou]]. The building uses a triangular [[floor plan]]. On the top of the tower is a four-bar neon clock that indicates the time by displaying different colours for 15-minute periods, blinking at the change of the quarter.\n\nAn [[anemometer]] is installed on the tip of the building's mast, at {{convert|378|m}} above sea level. The mast has a height of {{convert|102|m|abbr=on}}. It also houses the world's highest [[Church (building)|church]] inside a skyscraper, Sky City Church.\n\n==History==\nThe land upon which Central Plaza sits was reclaimed from [[Victoria Harbour]] in the 1970s. The {{convert|77800|sqft|sqm}} site was auctioned off by the Hong Kong Government at [[Hong Kong City Hall|City Hall Theatre]] on 25 January 1989. It was sold for a record HK$3.35 billion to a joint venture called \"Cheer City Properties\", owned 50 per cent by [[Sun Hung Kai Properties]] and 50 per cent by fellow real estate conglomerate [[Sino Land]] and their shareholders the [[Ng Teng Fong]] family.<ref name=\"record\">{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Chi-keung|title=Site sold for record $3.35 billion|work=South China Morning Post|date=26 January 1989|page=1}}</ref><ref name=\"tocost\">{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Chi-keung|title=Wan Chai site development to cost $1.8b|work=South China Morning Post|date=27 January 1989|page=47}}</ref> A third developer, Ryoden Development, joined the consortium afterward.<ref name=\"arupjournal\">{{cite journal|last1=Ayres|first1=Peter|last2=MacArthur|first2=John|title=Central Plaza, Hong Kong|journal=Arup Journal|date=1993|volume=28|issue=4|pages=16\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe first major tenant to sign a lease was the [[Provisional Airport Authority]], who on 2 August 1991 agreed to lease the 24th to 26th floors.<ref name=\"PAA\">{{cite news|last1=Moreira|first1=Peter|title=Central Plaza draws airport authority|work=South China Morning Post|date=3 August 1991|page=21}}</ref> A topping-out ceremony, presided over by Sir [[David Ford (civil servant)|David Ford]], was held on 9 April 1992.<ref name=\"heady\">{{cite news|last1=Wigan|first1=David|title=New tower lures a heady mix|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 April 1992|page=29}}</ref><ref name=\"newheights\">{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Nick|title=Central Plaza reaches new heights|work=South China Morning Post|date=10 April 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[Image:HK Central Plaza 60407 1st.jpg|left|thumb|Main Lobby]]\nCentral Plaza is made up of two principal components: a free standing {{convert|368|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} office tower and a {{convert|30.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} podium block attached to it. The tower is made up of three sections: a {{convert|30.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a {{convert|235.4|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower body containing 57 office floors, a [[sky lobby]] and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consist of six mechanical plant floors and a {{convert|102|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower mast.\n\nThe ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an {{convert|8400|m\u00b2|abbr=on}} landscaped garden with fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resource Building. By turning these space to public use, the building got 20% plot ratio more as bonus. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.\n\nCentral Plaza was designed by the Hong Kong architectural firm Ng Chun Man and Associates and engineered by [[Arup Group|Arup]]. The main contractor was a joint venture, comprising the contracting firms Sanfield and Tat Lee, called Manloze Ltd.<ref name=\"arupjournal\"/>\n\n==Design constraints==\n\n===Triangular shaped floor plan===\nThe building was designed to be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of {{convert|9|to|13.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.\nNonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.\n\n===Super high-rise building===\nAs the building is situated opposite to the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]], the only way to get more sea view for the building and not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings is to build it tall enough. However, a tall building brings a lot of difficulties to structural and building services design, for example, excessive system static pressure for water systems, high line voltage drop and long distance of vertical transportation. All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operation of the building.\n\n===Maximum clear ceiling height===\nAs a general practice, for achieving a clear height of {{convert|2.6|to|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a floor-to-floor height of {{convert|3.9|to|4.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} would be required. However, because of high windload in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of {{convert|3.6|m|abbr=on}} was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of {{convert|2.6|m|abbr=on}} in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.\n\n===Structural constraints===\n[[Image:Sky City Church Lounge.jpg|thumb|Sky City Church lounge area in the Apex]]\n*The site is a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rises to about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} below ground level. In the original brief, a 6-storey basement is required, therefore a diaphragm wall design came out.\n*The keyword to this project is time. With a briefing in a limited detail, the structural engineer needed to start work The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allows the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time consuming basement construction period from the critical path.\n*Wind loading is another major design criterion in Hong Kong as it is situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor [[Alan Davenport]] at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the [[University of Western Ontario]].\n\n===Steel structure vs reinforced concrete===\nSteel structure is more commonly adopted in high-rise building. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also of steelwork, designed to carry vertical load only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a highstrength concrete solution became possible.\n\nIn the final scheme, columns at {{convert|4.6|m|abbr=on}} centres and {{convert|1.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep}} floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.\n\nIn the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.\n\nAnother advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[Image:Central Plaza Sky Lobby.JPG|right|thumb|The ''Sky Lobby'' on the 46th floor was visited by American TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]''.]]\nThis skyscraper was visited in the seventh leg of the reality TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]'', which described Central Plaza as \"the tallest building in Hong Kong\".

He made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening shadows and transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light. Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes, often featuring violent struggles, torture and death. He worked rapidly, with live models, preferring to forego drawings and work directly onto the canvas. His influence on the new Baroque style that emerged from Mannerism was profound. It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]], and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the \"Caravaggisti\" or \"Caravagesques\", as well as [[Tenebrism|tenebrists]] or ''tenebrosi'' (\"shadowists\").\n\nCaravaggio trained as a painter in Milan before moving in his twenties to Rome. He developed a considerable name as an artist, and as a violent, touchy and provocative man. A brawl led to a death sentence for murder and forced him to flee to Naples. There he again established himself as one of the most prominent Italian painters of his generation. He traveled in 1607 to Malta and on to Sicily, and pursued a papal pardon for his sentence. In 1609 he returned to Naples, where he was involved in a violent clash; his face was disfigured and rumours of his death circulated. Questions about his mental state arose from his erratic and bizarre behavior. He died in 1610 under uncertain circumstances while on his way from Naples to Rome. Reports stated that he died of a fever, but suggestions have been made that he was murdered or that he died of lead poisoning.\n\nCaravaggio's innovations inspired Baroque painting, but the Baroque incorporated the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. The style evolved and fashions changed, and Caravaggio fell out of favor. In the 20th century interest in his work revived, and his importance to the development of Western art was reevaluated. The 20th-century art historian Andr\u00e9 Berne-Joffroy stated, \"What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.\"<ref>Quoted in Gilles Lambert, \"Caravaggio\", p.8.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life (1571\u20131592)===\n[[File:Canestra di frutta (Caravaggio).jpg|thumb|''[[Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Basket of Fruit]],'' c. 1595\u20131596, oil on canvas, [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]], [[Milan]]]]\n\nCaravaggio (Michelangelo Merisi or Amerighi) was born in [[Milan]], where his father, Fermo (Fermo Merixio), was a household administrator and architect-decorator to the Marchese of [[Caravaggio, Lombardy|Caravaggio]], a town not far from the city of [[Bergamo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Confirmed by the finding of the baptism certificate from the Milanese parish of Santo Stefano in Brolo |url=http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=bio&scheda=caravaggio_prima_parte |publisher=Italica.rai.it |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416123558/http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=bio&scheda=caravaggio_prima_parte |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}</ref>  In 1576 the family moved to Caravaggio (Caravaggius) to escape a plague that ravaged Milan, and Caravaggio's father and grandfather both died there on the same day in 1577.<ref name=\"ParisArtStudies\">{{cite web | url=http://www.parisartstudies.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=129 | title =Paris Art Studies Caravaggio | publisher =parisartstudies.com | year =2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.maltacultureguide.com/index.php?page=article&article_id=38 Malta Culture Guide].

Longhi was with Caravaggio on the night of the fatal brawl with Tomassoni; Robb, \"M\", p.341, believes that Minniti was as well.</ref> Minniti served Caravaggio as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping him to obtain important commissions in Sicily. Ostensibly, the first archival reference to Caravaggio in a contemporary document from Rome is the listing of his name, with that of Prospero Orsi as his partner, as an 'assistante' in a procession in October 1594 in honour of St. Luke.<ref>H.

The quotation originates in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Het Schilder-Boek'' of 1604, translated in full in Howard Hibbard, \"Caravaggio\".</ref> In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl, possibly unintentionally, and fled from Rome with a death sentence hanging over him.\n\n[[File:Caravaggio Judith Beheading Holofernes.jpg|thumb|''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]'' 1599\u20131602, [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome]]\n[[File:Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy-Caravaggio (c.1595).jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]'' (c.1595)]]\n\n''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'', his first composition with more than one figure, shows a boy, likely Minniti, having his palm read by a gypsy girl, who is stealthily removing his ring as she strokes his hand. The theme was quite new for Rome, and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond. This, however, was in the future: at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing. ''[[The Cardsharps]]'' \u2013 showing another na\u00efve youth of privilege falling the victim of card cheats \u2013 is even more psychologically complex, and perhaps Caravaggio's first true masterpiece. Like ''The Fortune Teller'', it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survive. More importantly, it attracted the patronage of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria del Monte]], one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For Del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle, Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces \u2013 ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'', a tipsy ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', an allegorical but realistic ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'' \u2013 featuring Minniti and other adolescent models.\n\nCaravaggio's first paintings on religious themes returned to realism, and the emergence of remarkable spirituality. The first of these was the ''[[Penitent Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Penitent Magdalene]]'', showing [[Mary Magdalene]] at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her. \"It seemed not a religious painting at all ... a girl sitting on a low wooden stool drying her hair ... Where was the repentance ... suffering ... promise of salvation?\"<ref>Robb, p.79. Robb is drawing on Bellori, who praises Caravaggio's \"true\" colours but finds the naturalism offensive: \"He (Caravaggio) was satisfied with [the] invention of nature without further exercising his brain.\"</ref> It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time. It was followed by others in the same style: ''[[Saint Catherine (Caravaggio)|Saint Catherine]]''; ''[[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Martha and Mary Magdalene]]''; ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]''; a ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Sacrifice of Isaac]]''; a ''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]''; and a ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''. These works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio's fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow artists. But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, and for these it was necessary to look to the Church.\n\nAlready evident was the intense realism or naturalism for which Caravaggio is now famous. He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects instead of as idealised creations. This allowed a full display of his virtuosic talents. This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of [[Michelangelo]] was very controversial at the time. Caravaggio also dispensed with the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy at the time. Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject \u2013 half-length figures and still life. ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), London|Supper at Emmaus]]'', from c. 1600\u20131601, is a characteristic work of this period demonstrating his virtuoso talent.\n\n===\"Most famous painter in Rome\" (1600\u20131606)===\nIn 1599, presumably through the influence of Del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]]. The two works making up the commission, the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]'', delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation. Thereafter he never lacked commissions or patrons.\n\n[[File:The Calling of Saint Matthew-Caravaggo (1599-1600).jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]'' (1599\u20131600), [[Contarelli Chapel]], [[San Luigi dei Francesi]], [[Rome]]. Without recourse to flying angels, parting clouds or other artifice, Caravaggio portrays the instant conversion of St Matthew, the moment on which his destiny will turn, by means of a beam of light and the pointing finger of Jesus.]]\n\nCaravaggio's [[tenebrism]] (a heightened [[chiaroscuro]]) brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity. Opinion among his artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: \"The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.\"<ref>Bellori. The passage continues: \"[The younger painters] outdid each other in copying him, undressing their models and raising their lights; and rather than setting out to learn from study and instruction, each readily found in the streets or squares of Rome both masters and models for copying nature.\"</ref>\n\nCaravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death, most notable and most technically masterful among them ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'' of circa 1602 for the Mattei Family, recently rediscovered in Ireland after two centuries.<ref>For the details of the discovery, see the essay by eye-witness Noel Barber (superior of the Jesuit community in Dublin in which the painting had been found), in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. Franco Mormando (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, 1999), catalog of the exhibition featuring the first display of the painting in the USA.</ref> For the most part each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers. The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio's dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar.<ref>For an outline of the Counter-Reformation Church's policy on decorum in art, see Giorgi, p.80. For a more detailed discussion, see Gash, p.8ff; and for a discussion of the part played by notions of decorum in the rejection of \"St Matthew and the Angel\" and \"Death of the Virgin\", see Puglisi, pp.179\u2013188.</ref>\n\nHis first version of ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel (Caravaggio)|Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', featuring the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and a second version had to be painted as ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]''. Similarly, ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'' was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus]]'', was accepted, it featured the saint's horse's haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]: \"Why have you put a horse in the middle, and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] on the ground?\" \"Because!\" \"Is the horse God?\" \"No, but he stands in God's light!\"<ref>Quoted without attribution in Lambert, p.66.</ref>\n\n[[File:Death of the Virgin-Caravaggio (1606).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'', 1601\u20131606, [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]\n\nOther works included ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment]]'', the ''[[Madonna di Loreto (Caravaggio)|Madonna di Loreto]]'' (''Madonna of the Pilgrims''), the ''[[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Grooms' Madonna]]'', and the ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]''. The history of these last two paintings illustrates the reception given to some of Caravaggio's art, and the times in which he lived. The ''[[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Grooms' Madonna]]'', also known as ''Madonna dei palafrenieri'', painted for a small altar in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days, and was then taken off. A cardinal's secretary wrote: \"In this painting there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust...One would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought...\"\n\n[[File:Amor Vincet Omnia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]'', 1601\u20131602, [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie (Berlin)|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]], [[Berlin]]. Caravaggio shows [[Cupid]] prevailing over all human endeavors: war, music, science, government.]]\n\nThe ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'', commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606. Caravaggio's contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]] records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin.<ref>Mancini: \"Thus one can understand how badly some modern artists paint, such as those who, wishing to portray the Virgin Our Lady, depict some dirty prostitute from the Ortaccio, as Michelangelo da Caravaggio did in the Death of the Virgin in that painting for the Madonna della Scala, which for that very reason those good fathers rejected it, and perhaps that poor man suffered so much trouble in his lifetime.\"</ref> [[Giovanni Baglione]], another contemporary, tells us it was due to Mary's bare legs<ref>Baglione: \"For the [church of] Madonna della Scala in Trastevere he painted the death of the Madonna, but because he had portrayed the Madonna with little decorum, swollen and with bare legs, it was taken away, and the Duke of Mantua bought it and placed it in his most noble gallery.\"</ref> \u2014a matter of decorum in either case. Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio's version fails to assert the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio's most able followers, [[Carlo Saraceni]]), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work showing the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. The ''Death of the Virgin'' was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and later acquired by [[Charles I of England]] before entering the French royal collection in 1671.\n\nOne secular piece from these years is ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Victorious]]'', painted in 1602 for [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a member of Del Monte's circle. The model was named in a memoir of the early 17th century as \"Cecco\", the diminutive for Francesco. He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610\u20131625 and known as [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] ('Caravaggio's Cecco'),<ref>While Gianni Papi's identification of Cecco del Caravaggio as Francesco Boneri is widely accepted, the evidence connecting Boneri to Caravaggio's servant and model in the early 17th century is circumstantial. See Robb, pp193\u2013196.</ref> carrying a bow and arrows and trampling symbols of the warlike and peaceful arts and sciences underfoot. He is unclothed, and it is difficult to accept this grinning urchin as the Roman god [[Cupid]] \u2013 as difficult as it was to accept Caravaggio's other semi-clad adolescents as the various angels he painted in his canvases, wearing much the same stage-prop wings. The point, however, is the intense yet ambiguous reality of the work: it is simultaneously Cupid and Cecco, as Caravaggio's Virgins were simultaneously the Mother of Christ and the Roman courtesans who modeled for them.\n\n===A crime too many (1606)===\n[[File:Saint Jerome Writing-Caravaggio (1605-6).jpg|thumb|''St. Jerome'', 1605\u20131606, [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nCaravaggio led a tumultuous life. He was notorious for brawling, even in a time and place when such behavior was commonplace, and the transcripts of his police records and trial proceedings fill several pages. On 29 May 1606, he killed, possibly unintentionally, a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni from [[Terni]] ([[Umbria]]). The circumstances of the brawl and the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni remain mysterious. Several contemporary ''avvisi'' referred to a quarrel over a gambling debt and a tennis game, and this explanation has become established in the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Life of Caravaggio\">{{cite book|last=Baglione|first=Giovanni | authorlink = Giovanni Baglione|title=Life of Caravaggio|year=1642|location=Italy|url=http://caravaggio.com/preview/attach/data01/D000001.htm}} Because of the excessive ardour of his spirit Michelangelo was a little wild and he sometimes looked for the chance to break his neck or to risk the lives of others. People as quarrelsome as he were often to be found in his company: and having in the end confronted Ranuccio Tomassoni a well-mannered young man over some disagreement about a tennis match they challenged one another to a duel. After Ranuccio fell to the ground Michelangelo struck him with the point of his sword and having wounded him in the thigh killed him.</ref>  But recent scholarship has made it clear that more was involved. Good modern accounts are to be found in [[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]]'s ''[[M (Peter Robb book)|M]]'' and Helen Langdon's ''Caravaggio: A Life''.

In Naples, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples.\n\nHis connections with the Colonnas led to a stream of important church commissions, including the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''.<ref>Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples; another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy; and a sister was married into the important Neapolitan Carafa family.

Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to [[Messina]] and, maybe, on to the island capital, [[Palermo]]. In Syracuse and Messina Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions. Among other works from this period are ''[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St. Lucy]]'', ''[[The Raising of Lazarus - Messina (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', and ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]''. His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds. \"His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth.\"<ref>Langdon, p.365.</ref> Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, which included sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, and mocking local painters.\n\nCaravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career. Mancini describes him as \"extremely crazy\", a letter of Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Minniti's 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour. The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta. Susinno's early-18th-century ''Le vite de' pittori Messinesi'' (\"Lives of the Painters of Messina\") provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio's erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb. Bellori writes of Caravaggio's \"fear\" driving him from city to city across the island and finally, \"feeling that it was no longer safe to remain\", back to Naples. Baglione says Caravaggio was being \"chased by his enemy\", but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was.\n\n====Return to Naples====\n[[File:CaravaggioSalomeMadrid.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio), Madrid|''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist'']]]]\n\nAfter only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples in the late summer of 1609. According to his earliest biographer he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now [[Paul V]]) and return to Rome.<ref>Baglione says that Caravaggio in Naples had \"given up all hope of revenge\" against his unnamed enemy.</ref> In Naples he painted ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]'', a final ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist (Borghese)]]'', and his last picture, ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''. His style continued to evolve \u2014 [[Saint Ursula]] is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the [[Huns]] strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings that had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was also much freer and more impressionistic.\n\n[[File:David with the Head of Goliath-Caravaggio (1610).jpg|thumb|upright|''David with the Head of Goliath'', 1609\u20131610, [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]]]]\nIn October 1609 he was involved in a violent clash, an attempt on his life, perhaps ambushed by men in the pay of the knight he had wounded in Malta or some other faction of the Order. His face was seriously disfigured and rumours circulated in Rome that he was dead. He painted a ''[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]'', showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to de Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time, he painted also a ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]'', showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing on the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio. This painting he may have sent to his patron, the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons.<ref>According to a 17th-century writer the painting of the head of Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist, while David is ''il suo Caravaggino'', \"his little Caravaggio\". This phrase is obscure, but it has been interpreted as meaning either that the boy is a youthful self-portrait, or, more commonly, that this is the Cecco who modeled for the ''Amor Vincit''. The sword-blade carries an abbreviated inscription that has been interpreted as meaning Humility Conquers Pride. Attributed to a date in Caravaggio's late Roman period by Bellori, the recent tendency is to see it as a product on Caravaggio's second Neapolitan period. (See Gash, p.125).</ref> Caravaggio hoped Borghese could mediate a pardon, in exchange for works by the artist.\n\nNews from Rome encouraged Caravaggio, and in the summer of 1610 he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, the gifts for Cardinal Scipione.<ref>A letter from the [[Bishop of Caserta]] in Naples to Cardinal Scipione Borghese in Rome, dated 29 July 1610, informs the Cardinal that the Marchesa of Caravaggio is holding two John the Baptists and a Magdalene that were intended for Borghese. These were presumably the price of Caravaggio's pardon from Borghese's uncle, the pope.</ref> What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture, shrouded in much mystery.\n\nThe bare facts seem to be that on 28 July an anonymous ''[[avviso]]'' (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later another ''avviso'' said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome. A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in [[Porto Ercole]], near [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]].\n\n===Death===\nCaravaggio had a fever at the time of his death, and what killed him has been a matter of historical debate and study.<ref name=geggel>{{cite web |url=https://www.livescience.com/63702-caravaggio-died-of-sepsis.html |title=Renaissance Master Caravaggio Didn't Die of Syphilis, but of Sepsis |work=Live Science |author=Laura Geggel |date=September 28, 2018 |accessdate=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Traditionally historians have long thought he died of syphilis.<ref name=geggel/> Some have said he had malaria, or possibly [[brucellosis]] from unpasteurized dairy.<ref name=geggel/> Some scholars have argued that Caravaggio was actually attacked and killed by the same \"enemies\" that had been pursuing him since he fled Malta, possibly Wignacourt and/or factions of the Knights.<ref>Robb argues this in ''M'' beginning in chapter 20.</ref>\n\nHuman remains found in a church in Porto Ercole in 2010 are believed to almost certainly belong to Caravaggio.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10682743 |title=BBC News \u2013 Vatican reveals Caravaggio painting 'found' in Rome |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> The findings come after a year-long investigation using DNA, carbon dating and other analyses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10333158 |title=BBC News \u2013 Church bones 'belong to Caravaggio', researchers say |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> Initial tests suggested Caravaggio might have died of [[lead poisoning]] - paints used at the time contained high amounts of lead salts, and Caravaggio is known to have indulged in violent behavior, as caused by lead poisoning.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Kington in Rome |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/16/caravaggio-italy-remains-ravenna-art |title=The mystery of Caravaggio's death solved at last \u2013 painting killed him |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-06-16|accessdate=2012-11-18 |location=London}}</ref> Later tests suggested he died as the result of a wound sustained in a brawl in Naples, specifically from [[sepsis]].<ref name=geggel/> Recently released Vatican documents (2002) also indicate that fatal wounds may have been sustained as a result of a vendetta, perpetrated after Caravaggio had murdered a love rival in a botched attempt at castration.  <ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1396127/Red-blooded-Caravaggio-killed-love-rival-in-bungled-castration-attempt.html The Telegraph 02 Jun 2002 - Red-blooded Caravaggio killed by love rival in bungled castration attempt]</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\n[[File:Portrait of a Courtesan by Caravaggio.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of a Courtesan'' [[Fillide Melandroni]]]]\n\nCaravaggio never married and had no known children, and Howard Hibbard notes the absence of erotic female figures from the artist's oeuvre: \"In his entire career he did not paint a single female nude.\"<ref>Hibbard, p.97</ref> On the other hand, the cabinet-pieces from the Del Monte period are replete with \"full-lipped, languorous boys ... who seem to solicit the onlooker with their offers of fruit, wine, flowers \u2013 and themselves\" suggesting an erotic interest in the male form.<ref>Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'' (Harvard, 2006) p.288</ref> At the same time, however, a connection with a certain Lena is mentioned in a 1605 court deposition by Pasqualone, where she is described as \"Michelangelo's girl\".<ref>Bertolotti, ''Artisti Lombardi''. pp.71\u201372</ref> According to G.B.

Writing in 1783, Mirabeau contrasted the personal life of Caravaggio directly with the writings of [[Apostle Paul|St Paul]] in the [[Book of Romans]],<ref>\"''Masculi, delicto naturali usu faeminae as exarserunt in desiriis suits in invicem, masculi in masculos, turpitudinem operant let mercidem quam oportuit erroris sui somatipsis recipient's.''\"\" -- Romans I:27.</ref> arguing that \"[[Romans]]\" excessively practice sodomy or [[homosexuality]]. The twenty-sixth verse of the first chapter<ref>Romans I:26, cf. https://www.bibleserver.com/text/VUL/Romans1%3A26.</ref> contains the Latin phrase: \"''Et f\u0153min\u00e6 eorum immutaverunt naturalem usum in eum usum qui est contra naturam.''\" The phrase, according to Mirabeau, entered Caravaggio's thoughts, and he claimed that such an \"abomination\" could be witnessed through a particular painting housed at the Museum of the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] \u2013 featuring a [[rosary]] of a [[blasphemous]] nature, in which a circle of thirty men (''turpiter ligati'') are intertwined in embrace and presented in unbridled composition.

Baglione accused Caravaggio and his friends of writing and distributing scurrilous doggerel attacking him; the pamphlets, according to Baglione's friend and witness Mao Salini, had been distributed by a certain Giovanni Battista, a ''bardassa,'' or boy prostitute, shared by Caravaggio and his friend Onorio Longhi. Caravaggio denied knowing any young boy of that name, and the allegation was not followed up.<ref>The transcript of the trial is given in Walter Friedlander, \"Caravaggio Studies\" (Princeton, 1955, revised edn. 1969)</ref>\n\nBaglione's painting of \"Divine Love\" has also been seen as a visual accusation of sodomy against Caravaggio.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such accusations were damaging and dangerous as [[sodomy]] was a capital crime at the time. Even though the authorities were unlikely to investigate such a well-connected person as Caravaggio, \"Once an artist had been smeared as a pederast, his work was smeared too.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Graham-Dixon 2011, p.4\"/> Francesco Susinoo in his later biography additionally relates the story of how the artist was chased by a school-master in Sicily for spending too long gazing at the boys in his care. Susino presents it as a misunderstanding, but Caravaggio may indeed have been seeking sexual solace; and the incident could explain one of his most homoerotic paintings: his last depiction of St John the Baptist.<ref>Andrew Graham-Dixon, ''Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane'', Penguin, 2011, p.412</ref>\n\nThe art historian, [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]] has summarised the debate:\n<blockquote>A lot has been made of Caravaggio's presumed homosexuality, which has in more than one previous account of his life been presented as the single key that explains everything, both the power of his art and the misfortunes of his life. There is no absolute proof of it, only strong circumstantial evidence and much rumour. The balance of probability suggests that Caravaggio did indeed have sexual relations with men. But he certainly had female lovers. Throughout the years that he spent in Rome he kept close company with a number of prostitutes. The truth is that Caravaggio was as uneasy in his relationships as he was in most other aspects of life. He likely slept with men. He did sleep with women. He settled with no one... [but] the idea that he was an early martyr to the drives of an unconventional sexuality is an anachronistic fiction.<ref name=\"Andrew Graham-Dixon 2011, p.4\"/></blockquote>\n\n==As an artist==\n===The birth of Baroque===\n[[File:The Taking of Christ-Caravaggio (c.1602).jpg|thumb|''[[The Taking of Christ]]'', 1602, [[National Gallery of Ireland]], [[Dublin]].

Caravaggio included himself as the figure at the top left.]]\n\nCaravaggio \"put the oscuro (shadows) into [[chiaroscuro]].\"<ref>Lambert, p.11.</ref> Chiaroscuro was practiced long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light. With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality that formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions.\n\nHe worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio's drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas. The approach was [[anathema]] to the skilled artists of his day, who decried his refusal to work from drawings and to idealise his figures. Yet the models were basic to his realism. Some have been identified, including [[Mario Minniti]] and [[Francesco Boneri]], both fellow artists, Minniti appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Boneri as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], [[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Anna Bianchini]], and Maddalena Antognetti (the \"Lena\" mentioned in court documents of the \"artichoke\" case<ref>Much of the documentary evidence for Caravaggio's life in Rome comes from court records; the \"artichoke\" case refers to an occasion when the artist threw a dish of hot artichokes at a waiter.</ref> as Caravaggio's concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints.<ref>Robb, ''passim'', makes a fairly exhaustive attempt to identify models and relate them to individual canvases.</ref> Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''.<ref>Caravaggio's self-portraits run from the ''Sick Bacchus'' at the beginning of his career to the head of Goliath in the ''David with the Head of Goliath'' in Rome's Borghese Gallery. Previous artists had included self-portraits as onlookers to the action, but Caravaggio's innovation was to include himself as a participant.</ref>\n\nCaravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment. ''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|The Supper at Emmaus]]'' depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveler, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the inn-keeper's eyes; the second after, he is the Saviour. In ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'', the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying \"who, me?\", while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, \"Yes, I will follow you\". With ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Resurrection of Lazarus]]'', he goes a step further, giving us a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection. The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognizing that of Christ, is alive. Other major [[Baroque]] artists would travel the same path, for example [[Bernini]], fascinated with themes from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===The ''Caravaggisti''===\n[[File:Martirio di San Pietro September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|''[[Crucifixion of St. Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'', 1601, [[Cerasi Chapel]], [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]]]]\n\nThe installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione's Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud. Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio. In the next generation of Caravaggisti there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of his rival [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed.\n\nCaravaggio's brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection \u2013 Naples was a possession of Spain \u2013 was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.\n\nA group of Catholic artists from [[Utrecht]], the [[Utrecht School|\"Utrecht Caravaggisti\"]], travelled to Rome as students in the first years of the 17th century and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio, as Bellori describes. On their return to the north this trend had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (who purchased one of his paintings for the Gonzaga of Mantua and painted a copy of the ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]''), [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], the last of whom presumably saw his work during his various sojourns in Italy.\n\n===Death and rebirth of a reputation===\n[[File:Caravaggio - La Deposizione di Cristo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Entombment of Christ]]'', (1602\u20131603), [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], [[Rome]]]]\n\nCaravaggio's innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Simon Vouet]], and the Spaniard [[Giuseppe Ribera]], within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism that may only be deduced from his surviving work.\n\nThus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the critical demolition-jobs done by two of his earliest biographers, [[Giovanni Baglione]], a rival painter with a personal vendetta, and the influential 17th-century critic [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], who had not known him but was under the influence of the earlier [[Giovanni Battista Agucchi]] and Bellori's friend [[Poussin]], in preferring the \"classical-idealistic\" tradition of the [[Bolognese school (painting)|Bolognese school]] led by the Carracci.<ref>Wikkkower, p. 266; also see criticism by fellow Italian [[Vincenzo Carducci]] (living in Spain), who calls Caravaggio an \"Antichrist\" of painting with \"monstrous\" talents of deception.</ref>  Baglione, his first biographer, played a considerable part in creating the legend of Caravaggio's unstable and violent character, as well as his inability to draw.<ref>Ostrow, 608</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, art critic [[Roberto Longhi]] brought Caravaggio's name once more to the foreground, and placed him in the European tradition: \"[[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different\".<ref>Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op. cit., p.15</ref> The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] agreed: \"With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.\"<ref>Bernard Berenson, in Lambert, op. cit., p.8</ref>\n\n===Epitaph===\n[[File:The Denial of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (1610).jpg|thumb|''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]'' (1610), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nCaravaggio's epitaph was composed by his friend Marzio Milesi. It reads:\n\n{{quote|Michelangelo Merisi, son of Fermo di Caravaggio \u2013 in painting not equal to a painter, but to Nature itself \u2013 died in Port' Ercole \u2013 betaking himself hither from Naples \u2013 returning to Rome \u2013 15th calend of August \u2013 In the year of our Lord 1610 \u2013 He lived thirty-six years nine months and twenty days \u2013 Marzio Milesi, Jurisconsult \u2013 Dedicated this to a friend of extraordinary genius.\"<ref>Inscriptiones et Elogia (Cod.Vat.7927)</ref>}}\n\nHe was commemorated on the front of the Banca d'Italia 100,000 lire banknote in the 1980s and 90s (before Italy switched to the Euro) with the back showing his ''Basket of Fruit''.\n\n==Oeuvre==\n{{See also|Chronology of works by Caravaggio}}\n[[File:Conversion on the Way to Damascus-Caravaggio (c.1600-1).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus]]'', 1601, [[Cerasi Chapel]], [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]]]]\n\nThere is disagreement as to the exact size of Caravaggio's oeuvre, with counts as low as 40 and as high as 80. In his biography,  Caravaggio scholar Alfred Moir writes \"The forty-eight colorplates in this book include almost all of the surviving works accepted by every Caravaggio expert as autograph, and even the least demanding would add fewer than a dozen more\".<ref>Alfred Moir, \"Caravaggio\", p.9</ref> One, ''[[The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew]]'', was recently authenticated and restored; it had been in storage in [[Hampton Court]], mislabeled as a copy. [[Richard Francis Burton]] writes of a \"picture of St. Rosario (in the museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), showing a circle of thirty men ''turpiter ligati''\" (\"lewdly banded\"), which is not known to have survived. The rejected version of ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'', intended for the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]], was destroyed during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], though black and white photographs of the work exist. In June 2011 it was announced that a previously unknown Caravaggio painting of [[Saint Augustine]] dating to about 1600 had been discovered in a private collection in Britain. Called a \"significant discovery\", the painting had never been published and is thought to have been commissioned by [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a patron of the painter in Rome.<ref>{{cite news|title=Unknown Caravaggio painting unearthed in Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/19/unknown-caravaggio-painting-unearthed-britain|author=|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011|accessdate=2011-06-20|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA painting believed by some experts to be Caravaggio's second version of ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'', tentatively dated between 1600 and 1610, was discovered in an attic in [[Toulouse]] in 2014.

Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular [[impasto]] characterize his work.\n\n==Life==\nChardin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. He lived on the [[Left Bank]] near [[\u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] until 1757, when [[Louis XV]] granted him a studio and living quarters in the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"metmuseum1\"/>\n\nChardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731.<ref name=rosenberg179>Rosenberg p. 179.</ref> He served apprenticeships with the history painters [[Pierre-Jacques Cazes]] and [[No\u00ebl-Nicolas Coypel]], and in 1724 became a master in the [[Acad\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc]].\n\n[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 007.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Ray (painting)|The Ray]]'', 1728, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], Paris]]\n\nAccording to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the \"small Corpus Christi\" (held eight days after the regular one) on the [[Place Dauphine]] (by the [[Pont Neuf]]). [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo|Van Loo]], passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?dq=intitle:Pont-neuf+inauthor&q=Chardin&pg=PA300&id=w3jG6Xy1rHUC#v=snippet&q=Chardin&f=false|title=Histoire du Pont-Neuf|work=google.com}}</ref>\n\nUpon presentation of ''The Ray'' in 1728, he was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Acad\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by \"produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him\",<ref name=\"Rosenberg56\">Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 56.</ref> and by such work as the restoration of the [[fresco]]es at the Galerie Fran\u00e7ois I at [[Fontainebleau]] in 1731.<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 20.</ref>\nIn November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agn\u00e8s, was baptized in 1733.

He would prove to be a \"dedicated academician\",<ref name=\"metmuseum1\">http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Chardin/chardin_more.htm</ref> regularly attending meetings for fifty years, and functioning successively as counsellor, treasurer, and secretary, overseeing in 1761 the installation of Salon exhibitions.<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 23.</ref>\n\nChardin's work gained popularity through reproductive engravings of his [[genre works|genre]] paintings (made by artists such as [[Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard L\u00e9pici\u00e9]] and P.-L. Sugurue), which brought Chardin income in the form of \"what would now be called royalties\".<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 32.</ref> In 1744 he entered his second marriage, this time to Fran\u00e7oise-Marguerite Pouget. The union brought a substantial improvement in Chardin's financial circumstances. In 1745 a daughter, Ang\u00e9lique-Fran\u00e7oise, was born, but she died in 1746.\n\nIn 1752 Chardin was granted a pension of 500 [[livres]] by Louis XV. At the Salon of 1759 he exhibited nine paintings; it was the first Salon to be commented upon by [[Denis Diderot]], who would prove to be a great admirer and public champion of Chardin's work.<ref>Rosenberg, p.182.</ref> Beginning in 1761, his responsibilities on behalf of the Salon, simultaneously arranging the exhibitions and acting as treasurer, resulted in a diminution of productivity in painting, and the showing of 'replicas' of previous works.<ref name=\"rosenberg183\">Rosenberg, p.183.</ref> In 1763 his services to the Acad\u00e9mie were acknowledged with an extra 200 livres in pension.

At a time when history painting was considered the supreme classification for public art, Chardin's subjects of choice were viewed as minor categories.<ref name=\"metmuseum1\"/> He favored simple yet beautifully textured still lifes, and sensitively handled domestic interiors and [[Genre works|genre paintings]].  Simple, even stark, paintings of common household items (''Still Life with a Smoker's Box'') and an uncanny ability to portray children's innocence in an unsentimental manner (''Boy with a Top'' [right]) nevertheless found an appreciative audience in his time, and account for his timeless appeal.\n[[File:Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, Boy Building a House of Cards, 1735 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, ''Le Faiseur de Ch\u00e2teaux de Cartes'' (Boy Building a House of Cards), 1735 at [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]\nLargely self-taught, Chardin was greatly influenced by the realism and subject matter of the 17th-century [[Low Countries|Low Country]] masters. Despite his unconventional portrayal of the ascendant [[bourgeoisie]], early support came from patrons in the French [[aristocracy]], including Louis XV. Though his popularity rested initially on paintings of animals and fruit, by the 1730s he introduced kitchen utensils into his work (''The Copper Cistern'', ca. 1735, Louvre). Soon figures populated his scenes as well, supposedly in response to a portrait painter who challenged him to take up the genre.<ref>Rosenberg, p. 71.</ref>  ''Woman Sealing a Letter'' (ca. 1733), which  may have been his first attempt,<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 190.</ref> was followed by half-length compositions of children saying grace, as in ''[[Le B\u00e9n\u00e9dicit\u00e9]]'', and kitchen maids in moments of reflection. These humble scenes deal with simple, everyday activities, yet they also have functioned as a source of documentary information about a level of French society not hitherto considered a worthy subject for painting.<ref>[http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_biografia_print207.html# Chardin at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021648/http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_biografia_print207.html |date=2007-09-27 }} Retrieved 15 July 2007.</ref> The pictures are noteworthy for their formal structure and pictorial harmony.<ref name=\"metmuseum1\" /> Chardin said about painting, \"Who said one paints with colors?

He depicted an adolescent building a house of cards on at least four occasions.  The version at [[Waddesdon Manor]] is the most elaborate.  Scenes such as these derived from 17th-century Netherlandish vanitas works, which bore messages about the transitory nature of human life and the worthlessness of material ambitions, but Chardin's also display a delight in the ephemeral phases of childhood for their own sake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collection.waddesdon.org.uk/search.do?view=detail&page=1&id=41446&db=object&_ga=1.215559511.1325358531.1459762060|title=Search Results|website=collection.waddesdon.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Sim\u00e9on Chardin 029.jpg|thumb|upright|''Still Life with Glass Flask and Fruit'', c.1728 (note reflected light on glass/silver)]]\n\nChardin frequently painted replicas of his compositions\u2014especially his genre paintings, nearly all of which exist in multiple versions which in many cases are virtually indistinguishable.<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 68\u201370.</ref> Beginning with ''The Governess'' (1739, in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]), Chardin shifted his attention from  working-class subjects to slightly more spacious scenes of bourgeois life.<ref>Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 187 and 242.</ref>\n\nIn 1756 Chardin returned to the subject of the still life.

Inside are a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle. The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of [[electromagnetic radiation]] intensity. The reason for the rotation was a cause of much [[scientific debate]] in the ten years following the invention of the device,<ref>{{citation |first=J. |last=Worrall |title=The pressure of light: The strange case of the vacillating 'crucial experiment' |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |year=1982 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(82)90023-1}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=The Electrical engineer |year=1884 |location=London |publisher=Biggs & Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AsAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA158 |page=158}}</ref> but in 1879 the currently accepted explanation for the rotation was published.<ref name=\"Usenet Physics FAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/LightMill/light-mill.html |title=How does a light-mill work? |last=Gibbs |first=Philip |date=1996 |website=math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/index.html |publisher=Usenet Physics FAQ |accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"The n-Category Cafe\">{{cite web |url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/07/light_mills.html |title=Light-Mills discussion; The n-Category Cafe |accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> Today the device is mainly used in physics education as a demonstration of a [[heat engine]] run by light energy.\n\nIt was invented in 1873 by the chemist [[Sir William Crookes]] as the by-product of some chemical research. In the course of very accurate quantitative chemical work, he was weighing samples in a partially evacuated chamber to reduce the effect of air currents, and noticed the weighings were disturbed when sunlight shone on the balance. Investigating this effect, he created the device named after him.\n\nIt is still manufactured and sold as an educational aid or curiosity.\n\n==General description==\n[[File:Radiometer 9965 Nevit.gif|thumbnail|250px|right|A Crookes radiometer in action]]\nThe [[radiometer]] is made from a glass bulb from which much of the air has been removed to form a partial [[vacuum]]. Inside the bulb, on a low [[friction]] spindle, is a rotor with several (usually four) vertical lightweight vanes spaced equally around the axis. The vanes are polished or white on one side and black on the other.\n\nWhen exposed to [[sunlight]], artificial light, or [[infrared]] radiation (even the heat of a hand nearby can be enough), the vanes turn with no apparent motive power, the dark sides retreating from the radiation source and the light sides advancing.\n\nCooling the radiometer causes rotation in the opposite direction.\n\n=== Effect observations ===\nThe effect begins to be [[observer (physics)|observed]] at partial vacuum pressures of a few [[torr]] (several hundred [[pascals]]), reaches a peak at around 10<sup>\u22122</sup>&nbsp;torr (1 pascal) and has disappeared by the time the vacuum reaches 10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;torr (10<sup>\u22124</sup> pascal) ([[Crookes radiometer#Explanations for the force on the vanes|see explanations note 1]]). At these very high vacuums the effect of photon [[radiation pressure]] on the vanes can be observed in very sensitive apparatus (see [[Nichols radiometer]]) but this is insufficient to cause rotation.\n\n===Origin of the name===\n*The [[prefix]] \"[[Wikt:radio-|radio-]]\" in the title originates from the combining form of Latin ''radius'', a ray: here it refers to [[electromagnetic radiation]].\n*A Crookes radiometer, consistent with the [[suffix]] \"[[Wikt:meter|- meter]]\" in its title, can provide a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity.\nThis can be done, for example, by visual means (e.g., a spinning slotted disk, which functions as a simple [[stroboscope]]) without interfering with the measurement itself.\n\nRadiometers are now commonly sold worldwide as a novelty ornament; needing no batteries, but only light to get the vanes to turn. They come in various forms, such as the one pictured, and are often used in [[science museum]]s to illustrate \"[[radiation pressure]]\" &ndash; a scientific principle that they do not in fact demonstrate.\n\n==Thermodynamic explanation==\n[[File:24. \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440.ogv|thumb|280px|right|A Crookes radiometer in action with the light switched on and off.(note that the explanation given in the caption to the clip doesn't agree with the explanation below)]] \n\n===Movement with black-body absorption===\nWhen a [[radiant energy]] source is directed at a Crookes radiometer, the radiometer becomes a heat engine.{{citation needed||date=November 2014}} The operation of a heat engine is based on a difference in [[temperature]] that is converted to a mechanical output. In this case, the black side of the vane becomes hotter than the other side, as radiant energy from a light source warms the black side by [[black-body absorption]] faster than the silver or white side. The internal air [[molecule]]s are heated up when they touch the black side of the vane. The details of exactly how this moves the warmer side of the vane forward are given in the [[#Explanations for the force on the vanes|section below]].\n\nThe internal temperature rises as the black vanes impart heat to the air molecules, but the molecules are cooled again when they touch the bulb's glass surface, which is at ambient temperature. This heat loss through the glass keeps the internal bulb temperature steady with the result that the two sides of the vanes develop a temperature difference. The white or silver side of the vanes are slightly warmer than the internal air temperature but cooler than the black side, as some heat conducts through the vane from the black side. The two sides of each vane must be thermally insulated to some degree so that the polished or white side does not immediately reach the temperature of the black side.{{citation needed||date=November 2014}} If the vanes are made of metal, then the black or white paint can be the insulation.{{citation needed||date=November 2014}} The glass stays much closer to ambient temperature than the temperature reached by the black side of the vanes.{{citation needed||date=November 2014}} The external air helps conduct heat away from the glass.\n\nThe air pressure inside the bulb needs to strike a balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High inside pressure inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for \"eddy currents\" to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can \"wrap around\" to the other side.\n\n===Movement with black-body radiation===\nWhen the radiometer is heated in the absence of a light source, it turns in the forward direction (i.e. black sides trailing). If a person's hands are placed around the glass without touching it, the vanes will turn slowly or not at all, but if the glass is touched to warm it quickly, they will turn more noticeably. Directly heated glass gives off enough infrared radiation to turn the vanes, but glass blocks much of the far-infrared radiation from a source of warmth not in contact with it. However, near-infrared and visible light more easily penetrate the glass.\n\nIf the glass is cooled quickly in the absence of a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns backwards (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the net exchange of heat between the black sides and the environment initially cools the black sides faster than the white sides. Upon reaching equilibrium, typically after a minute or two, reverse rotation ceases. This contrasts with sunlight, with which forward rotation can be maintained all day.\n\n==Explanations for the force on the vanes ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Crookes radiometer]] -->\nOver the years, there have been many attempts to explain how a Crookes radiometer works:\n\n#Crookes incorrectly suggested that the force was due to the [[radiation pressure|pressure of light]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=William |last=Crookes |authorlink=William Crookes |date=1 January 1874 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/164/501.full.pdf+html |doi=10.1098/rstl.1874.0015 |title=On Attraction and Repulsion Resulting from Radiation |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=164 |pages=501\u2013527}}.</ref> This theory was originally supported by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low-pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lebedew|first=Peter|year=1901|title=Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Druckkr\u00e4fte des Lichtes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.19013111102|journal=Annalen der Physik|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|volume=311|pages=433\u2013458|doi=10.1002/andp.19013111102|bibcode=1901AnP...311..433L}}</ref> Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the [[photon]]s on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed.  This results from [[conservation of momentum]] - the momentum of the reflected photon exiting on the light side must be matched by a [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] on the vane that reflected it.  The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes but can be measured with devices such as the [[Nichols radiometer]].\n#Another incorrect theory was that the heat on the dark side was causing the material to outgas, which pushed the radiometer around. This was effectively disproved by both Schuster's{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and Lebedev's experiments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n#A partial explanation is that gas [[molecule]]s hitting the warmer side of the vane will pick up some of the heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the vane. The imbalance of this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also do a better job of stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be the same. The greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed, [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the edges of the vanes because of the temperature difference there.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n#The final piece of the puzzle, [[thermal transpiration]], was theorized by [[Osborne Reynolds]]<ref>{{cite journal |first=Osborne |last=Reynolds |authorlink=Osborne Reynolds |date=1 January 1879 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/170/727.full.pdf+html |doi=10.1098/rstl.1879.0078 |title=On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state \u2026 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=170 |pages=727\u2013845}}; Part 2.</ref> in an unpublished paper that was refereed by Maxwell, who then published his paper which contained a critique of the mathematics in Reynolds's unpublished paper.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate. On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio. The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward due to the tangential force of the movement of the rarefied gas moving from the colder edge to the hotter edge.<ref name=\"Usenet Physics FAQ\"/>\n\n==All-black light mill==\nTo rotate, a light mill does not have to be coated with different colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each vane forms a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold [[nanocrystal]]s, which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] heating effect generates a net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' [[Direct Simulation Monte Carlo]] (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to [[Newton's Third Law]].\nThis monocolored design promotes the fabrication of [[micrometer]]- or [[nanometer]]- scaled light mills, as it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Han|first=Li-Hsin|author2=Shaomin Wu|author3=J.

Musicologist [[Ian McFarlane]] wrote that they became \"one of Australia's best-loved groups\" as well as \"one of the best live bands\", fusing \"a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul'n'blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook.\"\n\nSeven of their studio albums have reached the Australian top&nbsp;five, ''[[Breakfast at Sweethearts]]'' (February 1979), ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'' (June 1980), ''[[Circus Animals]]'' (March 1982, No.&nbsp;1), ''[[Twentieth Century (Cold Chisel album)|Twentieth Century]]'' (April 1984, No.&nbsp;1), ''[[The Last Wave of Summer]]'' (October 1998, No.&nbsp;1), ''[[No Plans]]'' (April 2012) and ''[[The Perfect Crime (Cold Chisel album)|The Perfect Crime]]'' (October 2015). Their top&nbsp;10 singles are \"[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]\" (1982), \"[[Hands Out of My Pocket]]\" (1994) and \"[[The Things I Love in You]]\" (1998).\n\nAt the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1993]] they were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. In 2001 [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA), listed their single, \"[[Khe Sanh (song)|Khe Sanh]]\" (May 1978), at No.&nbsp;8 of the all-time best [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Australian song]]s. ''Circus Animals'' was listed at No.&nbsp;4 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'' (October 2010), while ''East'' appeared at No.&nbsp;53. They won [[APRA Awards (Australia)#The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music|The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music]] at the [[APRA Music Awards of 2016]]. Cold Chisel's popularity is largely restricted to Australia and New Zealand, with their songs and musicianship highlighting [[working class]] life. Their early bass guitarist (1973\u201375), Les Kaczmarek, died in December 2008; Steve Prestwich died of a [[brain tumour]] in January 2011.\n\n==Beginnings (1973\u20131978)==\nCold Chisel originally formed as '''Orange''' in [[Adelaide]] in 1973 as a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band by Ted Broniecki on keyboards, Les Kaczmarek on bass guitar, [[Ian Moss]] on guitar and vocals, [[Steve Prestwich]] on drums and [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]] on piano.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Shedden\"/> Their early material included cover versions of [[Free (band)|Free]] and [[Deep Purple]] material.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Shedden\"/> Broniecki left by September 1973 and seventeen-year-old singer, [[Jimmy Barnes]] \u2014 called Jim Barnes during their initial career \u2014 joined in December.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Shedden\"/>\n\nThe group changed its name several times before settling on Cold Chisel in 1974 after Walker's song of that title.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Barnes' relationship with the others was volatile: he often came to blows with Prestwich and left the band several times.<ref name=\"Shedden\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> During these periods Moss would handle vocals until Barnes returned.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Walker emerged as the group's primary songwriter and spent 1974 in [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], completing his studies in quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Barnes' older brother, [[Swanee (singer)|John Swan]], was a member of Cold Chisel around this time, providing backing vocals and percussion.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> After several violent incidents, including beating up a roadie, he was fired.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"Creswell\"/> In mid-1975 Barnes left to join [[Fraternity (band)|Fraternity]] as [[Bon Scott]]'s replacement on lead vocals, alongside Swan on drums and vocals.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Creswell\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane F\"/> Kaczmarek left Cold Chisel during 1975 and was replaced by [[Phil Small]] on bass guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> In November of that year, without Barnes, they recorded their early demos.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nIn May 1976 Cold Chisel relocated to Melbourne, but \"frustrated by their lack of progress,\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> they moved on to Sydney in November.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> In May of the following year Barnes told his fellow members that he would leave again. From July he joined Feather for a few weeks, on co-lead vocals with Swan \u2013 they were a Sydney-based hard rock group, which had evolved from [[Blackfeather]].<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane Fe\"/> A farewell performance for Cold Chisel, with Barnes aboard, went so well that the singer changed his mind and returned.<ref name=\"Creswell\"/> In the following month the Warner Music Group signed the group.<ref name=\"Creswell\"/>\n\n==\"Khe Sanh\" to ''Breakfast at Sweethearts'' (1978\u20131979)==\nIn the early months of 1978 Cold Chisel recorded their [[Cold Chisel (album)|self-titled debut album]] with their manager and producer, Peter Walker (ex-[[Bakery (band)|Bakery]]).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> All tracks were written by Walker, except \"Juliet\", where Barnes composed its melody and Walker the lyrics.<ref name=\"APRA Juliet\"/> ''Cold Chisel'' was released in April and included guest studio musicians: Dave Blight on [[harmonica]] (who became a regular on-stage guest) and [[saxophone|saxophonists]] [[Joe Camilleri]] and [[Wilbur Wilde]] (from [[Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons]]). Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], described how, \"[it] failed to capture the band's renowned live firepower, despite the presence of such crowd favourites as 'Khe Sanh', 'Home and Broken Hearted' and 'One Long Day'.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It reached the top&nbsp;40 on the [[Kent Music Report]] and was certified as a gold record for shipment of 35000 units.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nIn May 1978, \"[[Khe Sanh (song)|Khe Sanh]]\", was released as their debut single but it was declared too offensive for commercial radio due to the sexual implication of the lyrics, \"Their legs were often open/But their minds were always closed.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"McGrath\"/> However, it was played regularly on Sydney youth radio station, [[Double J (radio network)|Double J]], which was not subject to the restrictions as it was part of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC). Another ABC program, ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''{{'}}s producers asked them to change the lyric but they refused.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Despite such setbacks, \"Khe Sanh\" reached No.&nbsp;41 on the Kent Music Report singles chart.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> It became Cold Chisel's signature tune and was popular among their fans. They later remixed the track, with re-recorded vocals, for inclusion on the international version of their third album, ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'' (June 1980).\n\nThe band's next release was a live five-track extended play, ''[[You're Thirteen, You're Beautiful, and You're Mine]]'', in November 1978.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> McFarlane observed, \"It captured the band in its favoured element, fired by raucous versions of Walker's 'Merry-Go-Round' and Chip Taylor's 'Wild Thing'.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It was recorded at Sydney's Regent Theatre in 1977, when they had [[Midnight Oil]] as one of the support acts. Australian writer, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], described a typical performance by Cold Chisel, \"Everybody was talking about them anyway, drawn by the songs, and Jim Barnes' presence on stage, crouched, sweating, as he roared his vocals into the microphone at the top of his lungs.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The EP peaked at No.&nbsp;35 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\n\"Merry Go Round\" was re-recorded for their second studio album, ''[[Breakfast at Sweethearts]]'' (February 1979). This was recorded between July 1978 and January 1979 with producer, [[Richard Batchens]], who had previously worked with [[Richard Clapton]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] and Blackfeather.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Batchens smoothed out the band's rough edges and attempted to give their songs a sophisticated sound.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> With regards to this approach, the band were unsatisfied with the finished product.<ref name=rstone>{{cite magazine | title = Meeting of the Minds|issue=768| author=Dan Lander |magazine= [[Rolling Stone Australia]]|pages=52\u201357| date = November 2015| publisher = Paper Riot Pty Ltd}}</ref> It peaked at No.&nbsp;4 and was the top selling album in Australia by a locally-based artist for that year;<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> it was certified platinum for shipment of 70000 copies.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> The majority of its tracks were written by Walker, with Barnes and Walker on the lead single, \"Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)\" (September 1978), and Moss contributed to \"Dresden\". \"Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)\" became a live favourite, and was covered by [[U2]] during Australian tours in the 1980s.\n\n==\"Choirgirl\" to ''East'' (1979\u20131980)==\nCold Chisel had gained national chart success and increased popularity of their fans without significant commercial radio airplay or support from ''Countdown''. The members developed reputations for wild behaviour, particularly Barnes who claimed to have had sex with over 1000 women and who consumed more than a bottle of [[vodka]] each night while performing.<ref name = \"Creswell\"/> In late 1979, severing their relationship with Batchens, Cold Chisel chose [[Mark Opitz]] to produce the next single, \"[[Choirgirl (song)|Choirgirl]]\" (November).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> It is a Walker composition dealing with a young woman's experience with [[abortion]]. Despite the subject matter it reached No.&nbsp;14.<ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\n\"Choirgirl\" paved the way for the group's third studio album, ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]''  (June 1980), with Opitz producing.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Recorded over two months in early 1980, ''East'', reached No.&nbsp;2 and is the second highest selling album by an Australian artist for that year.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''{{'}}s Gregg Flynn noticed, \"[they are] one of the few Australian bands in which each member is capable of writing hit songs.\"<ref name=\"Flynn\"/> Despite the continued dominance of Walker, the other members contributed more tracks to their play list, and this was their first album to have songs written by each one.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> McFarlane described it as, \"a confident, fully realised work of tremendous scope.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Nimmervoll explained how, \"This time everything fell into place, the sound, the songs, the playing... ''East'' was a triumph. [The group] were now the undisputed No.&nbsp;1 rock band in Australia.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nThe album varied from straight ahead rock tracks, \"Standing on the Outside\" and \"My Turn to Cry\", to [[rockabilly]]-flavoured work-outs (\"Rising Sun\", written about Barnes' relationship with his then-girlfriend Jane Mahoney) and pop-laced love songs (\"[[My Baby (Cold Chisel song)|My Baby]]\", featuring Joe Camilleri on saxophone) to a poignant piano ballad about prison life, \"Four Walls\". The cover art showed Barnes reclined in a bathtub wearing a [[kamikaze]] bandanna in a room littered with junk and was inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1793 painting, ''[[The Death of Marat]]''.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The Ian Moss-penned \"Never Before\" was chosen as the first song to air on the ABC's youth radio station, [[Triple J]], when it switched to the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] band that year. Supporting the release of ''East'', Cold Chisel embarked on the Youth in Asia Tour from May 1980, which took its name from a lyric in \"Star Hotel\".\n\n==''Swingshift'' to ''Circus Animals'' (1981\u20131982)==\nThe Youth in Asia Tour performances were used for Cold Chisel's double live album, ''[[Swingshift]]'' (March 1981).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Nimmervoll declared, \"[the group] rammed what they were all about with [this album].\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> In March 1981 the band won seven categories: Best Australian Album, Most Outstanding Achievement, Best Recorded Song Writer, Best Australian Producer, Best Australian Record Cover Design, Most Popular Group and Most Popular Record, at the ''Countdown''/''[[TV Week]]'' [[Australian pop music awards#1980|pop music awards for 1980]].<ref name=\"Warner\"/><ref name=\"Kimball Count\"/><ref name=\"Count1980\"/> They attended the ceremony at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and were due to perform: however, as a protest against a TV magazine's involvement, they refused to accept any trophy and finished the night with, \"My Turn to Cry\".<ref name=\"Warner\"/><ref name=\"Kimball Count\"/><ref name=\"Count1980\"/> After one verse and chorus, they smashed up the set and left the stage.<ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/>\n\n''Swingshift'' debuted at No&nbsp;1,<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> which demonstrated their status as the highest selling local act.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> With a slightly different track-listing, ''East'', was issued in the United States and they undertook their first US tour in mid-1981.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Ahead of the tour they had issued, \"My Baby\", for the North America market and it reached the top&nbsp;40 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s chart, [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]].<ref name=\"Billb S\"/> They were generally popular as a live act there, but the US branch of their label did little to promote the album.<ref name=\"Creswell\"/> According to Barnes' biographer, [[Toby Creswell]], at one point they were ushered into an office to listen to the US master tape to find it had substantial hiss and other ambient noise,<ref name=\"Creswell\"/> which made it almost unable to be released. Notwithstanding, the album reached the lower region of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in July.<ref name=\"Billb A\"/> The group were booed off stage after a lacklustre performance in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in May 1981 opening for Ted Nugent. Other support slots they took were for Cheap Trick, Joe Walsh, Heart and the Marshall Tucker Band.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> European audiences were more accepting of the Australian band and they developed a fan base in Germany.\n\nIn August 1981 Cold Chisel began work on a fourth studio album, ''[[Circus Animals]]'' (March 1982), again with Opitz producing.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> To launch the album, the band performed under a circus tent at Wentworth Park in Sydney and toured heavily once more, including a show in Darwin that attracted more than 10&nbsp;percent of the city's population.<ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in both Australia and on the [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]].<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"NZ Charts\"/> In October 2010 it was listed at No.&nbsp;4 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'', by music journalists, Creswell, [[Craig Mathieson]] and [[John O'Donnell (music journalist)|John O'Donnell]].<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/>\n\nIts lead single, \"[[You Got Nothing I Want]]\" (November 1981), is an aggressive Barnes-penned hard rock track, which attacked the US industry for its handling of the band on their recent tour.<ref name=\"Zupp Circus\"/> The song caused problems for Barnes when he later attempted to break into the US market as a solo performer; senior music executives there continued to hold it against him. Like its predecessor, ''Circus Animals'', contained songs of contrasting styles, with harder-edged tracks like \"Bow River\" and \"Hound Dog\" in place beside more expansive ballads such as the next two singles, \"[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]\" (March 1982) and \"[[When the War Is Over]]\" (August), both are written by Prestwich.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/><ref name=\"Zupp Circus\"/> \"Forever Now\" is their highest charting single in two [[Australasia]]n markets: No.&nbsp;4 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart and No.&nbsp;2 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"NZ Charts\"/>\n\n\"When the War Is Over\" is the most covered Cold Chisel track \u2013 [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] included a version on their 1989 album, ''[[Raging Silence]]''; [[John Farnham]] recorded it while he and Prestwich were members of [[Little River Band]] in the mid-1980s and again for his 1990 solo album, ''[[Age of Reason (album)|Age of Reason]]''. The song was also a No.&nbsp;1 hit for former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' contestant, [[Cosima De Vito]], in 2004 and was performed by [[Bobby Flynn]] during that show's 2006 season. \"Forever Now\" was covered, as a country waltz, by Australian band, [[the Reels]].\n\n==Break-up (1983)==\nSuccess outside Australasia continued to elude Cold Chisel and friction occurred between the members. According to McFarlane, \"[the] failed attempts to break into the American market represented a major blow... [their] earthy, high-energy rock was overlooked.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> In early 1983 they toured Germany but the shows went so badly that in the middle of the tour Walker up-ended his keyboard and stormed off stage during one show.  After returning to Australia, Preswtich was fired and replaced by [[Ray Arnott]], formerly of the 1970s [[progressive rock]]ers, [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]], and [[country rock]]ers, [[the Dingoes]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"wild colonial\"/>\n\nAfter this, Barnes requested a large advance from management. Now married with a young child, exorbitant spending had left him almost broke. His request was refused as there was a standing arrangement that any advance to one band member had to be paid to all the others. After a meeting on 17 August during which Barnes quit the band it was decided that the group would split up.<ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/> A farewell concert series, The Last Stand, was planned and a final studio album, ''[[Twentieth Century (Cold Chisel album)|Twentieth Century]]'' (February 1984), was recorded.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/> Prestwich returned for that tour, which began in October.<ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/> Before the last four scheduled shows in Sydney, Barnes lost his voice and those dates were postponed to mid-December.<ref name=\"Creswell Fabinyi\"/><ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n[[File:IMG 6448 - Flickr - jeaneeem.jpg|thumb|right|Barnes, 2011]]\nThe band's final performances were at the Sydney Entertainment Centre from 12 to 15 December 1983<ref name=\"Perry\"/> \u2013 ten&nbsp;years since their first live appearance as Cold Chisel in Adelaide \u2013 the group then disbanded.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The Sydney shows formed the basis of a concert film, ''[[The Last Stand (1984 film)|The Last Stand]]'' (July 1984), which became the biggest-selling cinema-released concert documentary by an Australian band to that time. Other recordings from the tour were used on a live album, ''[[The Barking Spiders Live: 1983]]'' (1984), the title is a reference to the pseudonym the group occasionally used when playing warm-up shows before tours. Some were also used as b-sides for a three-CD singles package, ''Three Big XXX Hits'', issued ahead of the release of their 1994 compilation album, ''[[Teenage Love (album)|Teenage Love]]''.\n\nDuring breaks in the tour, ''Twentieth Century'', was recorded. It was a fragmentary process, spread across various studios and sessions as the individual members often refused to work together \u2013 both Arnott (on ten tracks) and Prestwich (on three tracks) are recorded as drummers. The album reached No.&nbsp;1 and provided the singles, \"[[Saturday Night (Cold Chisel song)|Saturday Night]]\" (March 1984) and \"[[Flame Trees]]\" (August), both of which remain radio staples. \"Flame Trees\", co-written by Prestwich and Walker, took its title from the BBC series, ''[[The Flame Trees of Thika]]'', although it was lyrically inspired by the organist's hometown of [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]]. Barnes later recorded an acoustic version for his 1993 solo album, ''[[Flesh and Wood]]'', and it was also covered by [[Sarah Blasko]] in 2006.\n\n==Aftermath (1984\u20131990)==\nBarnes launched his solo career in January 1984, which has provided nine Australian number-one studio albums and an array of hit singles, including, \"[[Too Much Ain't Enough Love]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1. He has recorded with [[INXS]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Joe Cocker]] and John Farnham to become one of the country's most popular male rock singers. Prestwich joined [[Little River Band]] in 1984 and appeared on the albums, ''[[Playing to Win]]'' and ''[[No Reins]]'', before departing in 1986 to join Farnham's touring band. Moss, Small and Walker took extended breaks from music.\n\nSmall maintained a low profile as a member in a variety of minor groups, Pound, the Earls of Duke and the Outsiders.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Walker formed Catfish in 1988, ostensibly a solo band with a variable membership, which included Moss, Charlie Owen and Dave Blight at times.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Catfish played a modern jazz aspect and the recordings during this phase attracted little commercial success. During 1988 and 1989 Walker wrote several tracks for Moss including the singles, \"[[Tucker's Daughter]]\" (November 1988) and \"[[Telephone Booth (song)|Telephone Booth]]\" (June 1989), which appeared on Moss' debut solo album, ''[[Matchbook (Ian Moss album)|Matchbook]]'' (August 1989).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane IM\"/> Both the album and \"Tucker's Daughter\" peaked at No.&nbsp;1.<ref name=\"McFarlane IM\"/><ref name=\"AUS Charts IM\"/> Moss won five trophies at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1990]].<ref name=\"McFarlane IM\"/><ref name=\"ARIA1990\"/> His other solo albums met with less chart or award success.<ref name=\"McFarlane IM\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s, Cold Chisel were courted to re-form but refused, at one point reportedly turning down a $5&nbsp;million offer to play a sole show in each of the major Australian state capitals. Moss and Walker often collaborated on projects, neither worked with Barnes until Walker wrote, \"Stone Cold\", for the singer's sixth studio album, ''[[Heat (Jimmy Barnes album)|Heat]]'' (October 1993). The pair recorded an acoustic version for ''Flesh and Wood'' (December). Thanks primarily to continued radio airplay and Barnes' solo success, Cold Chisel's legacy remained solidly intact.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JB\"/> By the early 1990s the group had surpassed 3 million album sales, most sold since 1983.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> The 1991 compilation album, ''[[Chisel (album)|Chisel]]'', was re-issued and re-packaged several times, once with the long-deleted 1978 EP as a bonus disc and a second time in 2001 as a double album. The ''Last Stand'' soundtrack album was finally released in 1992. In 1994 a complete album of previously unreleased demo and rare live recordings, ''[[Teenage Love (album)|Teenage Love]]'', was released, which provided three singles.\n\n==Reunions (1997\u20132010)==\nCold Chisel reunited in October 1997, with the line-up of Barnes, Moss, Prestwich, Small and Walker.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> They recorded their sixth studio album, ''[[The Last Wave of Summer]]'' (October 1998), from February to July with the band members co-producing.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> They supported it with a national tour. The album debuted at number&nbsp;one on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> In 2003 they re-grouped for the Ringside Tour and in 2005 again to perform at a benefit for the victims of the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne. Founding bass guitarist, Les Kaczmarek, died of liver failure on 5 December 2008, aged 53.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> Walker described him as, \"a wonderful and beguiling man in every respect.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nOn 10 September 2009 Cold Chisel announced they would reform for a one-off performance at the [[Sydney 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] event on 5 December.<ref name=\"McCabe Reform\"/> The band performed at [[ANZ Stadium]] to the largest crowd of its career, with more than 45,000 fans in attendance.<ref name=\"ANZ Stade\"/> They played a single live show in 2010: at the [[Deniliquin]] [[ute muster]] in October. In December Moss confirmed that Cold Chisel were working on new material for an album.\n\n==Death of Steve Prestwich to ''The Perfect Crime'' (2011\u20132015)==\n[[File:IMG 6416 - Flickr - jeaneeem.jpg|thumb|right|Ian Moss, 2011. Don Walker in the background.]]\nIn January 2011 Steve Prestwich was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]; he underwent surgery on 14 January but never regained consciousness and died two days later, aged 56.<ref name=\"Levy\"/> All six of Cold Chisel's studio albums were re-released in digital and CD formats in mid-2011. Three digital-only albums were released, ''[[Never Before (Cold Chisel album)|Never Before]]'', ''[[Besides (Cold Chisel album)|Besides]]'' and ''[[Covered (Cold Chisel album)|Covered]]'', as well as a new compilation album, ''[[The Best of Cold Chisel|The Best of Cold Chisel: All for You]]'', which peaked at number&nbsp;2 on the ARIA Charts.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> The thirty-date Light the Nitro Tour was announced in July along with the news that former [[Divinyls]] and Catfish drummer, [[Charley Drayton]], had replaced Prestwich. Most shows on the tour sold out within days and new dates were later announced for early 2012.\n\n''[[No Plans]]'', their seventh studio album, was released in April 2012, with [[Kevin Shirley]] producing,<ref name=\"Condon\"/> which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s Stephen Fitzpatrick rated it as four-and-a-half out-of-five and found its lead track, \"All for You\", \"speaks of redemption; of a man's ability to make something of himself through love.\"<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick\"/> The track, \"I Got Things to Do\", was written and sung by Prestwich, which Fitzpatrick described as, \"the bittersweet finale\" and had \"a vocal track the other band members did not know existed until after his death.\"<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick\"/> Midway through 2012 they had a short UK tour and played with Soundgarden and Mars Volta at [[Calling Festival|Hard Rock Calling]] at London's Hyde Park.<ref name=\"Harte\"/><ref name=\"Aus TimeMar12\"/>\n\nThe group's ninth studio album, ''[[The Perfect Crime (Cold Chisel album)|The Perfect Crime]]'', appeared in October 2015, again with Shirley producing, which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/><ref name=\"Bell\"/> Martin Boulton of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' rated it at four-out-of-five stars and explained, \"[they] work incredibly hard, not take any shortcuts and play the hell out of the songs\" where the album, \"delves further back to their rock'n'roll roots with chief songwriter [Walker] carving up the keys, guitarist [Moss] both gritty and sublime and the [Small/Drayton] engine room firing on every cylinder. Barnes' voice sounds worn, wonderful and better than ever.\"<ref name=\"Boulton\"/>\n\n==Musical style and lyrical themes==\nMcFarlane described Cold Chisel's early career in his ''[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]'' (1999), \"after ten years on the road, [they] called it a day. Not that the band split up for want of success; by that stage [they] had built up a reputation previously uncharted in Australian rock history. By virtue of the profound effect the band's music had on the many thousands of fans who witnessed its awesome power, Cold Chisel remains one of Australia's best-loved groups. As one of the best live bands of its day, [they] fused a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul'n'blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> ''[[The Canberra Times]]''{{'}} Luis Feliu, in July 1978, observed how, \"This is not just another Australian rock band, no mediocrity here, and their honest, hard-working approach looks like paying off.\"<ref name=\"Feliu\"/> While \"the range of styles tackled and done convincingly, from hard rock to blues, boogie, rhythm and blues, is where the appeal lies.\"<ref name=\"Feliu\"/>\n\nInfluences from blues and early rock n' roll was broadly apparent, fostered by the love of those styles by Moss, Barnes and Walker. Small and Prestwich contributed strong pop sensibilities. This allowed volatile rock songs like \"You Got Nothing I Want\" and \"Merry-Go-Round\" to stand beside thoughtful ballads like \"Choirgirl\", pop-flavoured love songs like \"My Baby\" and caustic political statements like \"Star Hotel\", an attack on the late 1970s government of [[Malcolm Fraser]], inspired by the [[Star hotel riot|Star Hotel riot]] in [[Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]].\n\nThe songs were not overtly political but rather observations of everyday life within Australian society and culture, in which the members with their various backgrounds (Moss was from [[Alice Springs, Australia|Alice Springs]], Walker grew up in rural New South Wales, Barnes and Prestwich were working-class immigrants from the UK) were quite well able to provide.\n\nCold Chisel's songs were about distinctly Australian experiences, a factor often cited as a major reason for the band's lack of international appeal. \"Saturday Night\" and \"Breakfast at Sweethearts\" were observations of the urban experience of Sydney's [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] district where Walker lived for many years. \"Misfits\", which featured on the b-side to \"My Baby\", was about homeless kids in the suburbs surrounding Sydney. Songs like \"Shipping Steel\" and \"Standing on The Outside\" were working class anthems and many others featured characters trapped in mundane, everyday existences, yearning for the good times of the past (\"Flame Trees\") or for something better from life (\"Bow River\").\n\n==Reputation==\nAlongside contemporaries like [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]] and [[Midnight Oil]], Cold Chisel was renowned as one of the most dynamic live acts of their day and from early in their career concerts routinely became sell-out events. But the band was also famous for its wild lifestyle, particularly the hard-drinking Barnes, who played his role as one of the wild men of Australian rock to the hilt, never seen on stage without at least one bottle of vodka and often so drunk he could barely stand upright. Despite this, by 1982 he was a devoted family man who refused to tour without his wife and daughter. All the other band members were also settled or married; Ian Moss had a long-term relationship with the actress, [[Megan Williams (actress)|Megan Williams]], (she even sang on ''Twentieth Century'') whose own public persona could have hardly been more different.\n\nIt was the band's public image that often had them compared less favourably with other important acts like [[Midnight Oil]], whose music and politics (while rather more overt) were often similar but whose image and reputation was far more clean-cut. Cold Chisel remained hugely popular however and by the mid-1990s they continued to sell records at such a consistent rate they became the first Australian band to achieve higher sales after their split than during their active years.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nAt the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1993]] they were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"ARIA1993\"/> While repackages and compilations accounted for much of these sales, 1994's ''Teenage Love'' provided two of its singles, which were top ten hits. When the group finally reformed in 1998 the resultant album was also a major hit and the follow-up tour sold out almost immediately. In 2001 [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA), listed their single, \"Khe Sanh\" (May 1978), at No.&nbsp;8 of the all-time best [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Australian song]]s.<ref name=\"APRA10\"/>\n\nCold Chisel were one of the first Australian acts to have become the subject of a major tribute album. In 2007, ''[[Standing on the Outside (album)|Standing on the Outside: The Songs of Cold Chisel]]'' was released, featuring a collection of the band's songs as performed by artists including [[The Living End]], [[Evermore (band)|Evermore]], [[Something for Kate]], [[Pete Murray]], [[Katie Noonan]], [[You Am I]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Alex Lloyd]], [[Thirsty Merc]] and [[Ben Lee]],<ref name=\"Age Mar03\"/> many of whom were children when Cold Chisel first disbanded and some, like the members of Evermore, had not even been born. ''Circus Animals'' was listed at No.&nbsp;4 in the book, ''100 Best Australian Albums'' (October 2010), while ''East'' appeared at No.&nbsp;53.<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> They won [[APRA Awards (Australia)#The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music|The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music]] at the [[APRA Music Awards of 2016]].<ref name=\"Ted Albert 2016\"/>\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n* [[Ian Moss]]&nbsp;\u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(1973\u20131984, 1998, 2003, 2009-present)</small>\n* [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]]&nbsp;\u2013 keyboards, backing vocals <small>(1973\u20131984, 1998, 2003, 2009-present)</small>\n* [[Jimmy Barnes]]&nbsp;\u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(1973\u20131975, 1975\u20131984, 1998, 2003, 2009\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Phil Small]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar <small>(1975\u20131984, 1998, 2003, 2009-present)</small>\n* [[Charley Drayton]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n\n;Former members\n* [[Steve Prestwich]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(1973\u20131983, 1998, 2003, 2009\u20132011; died 2011)</small>\n* Les Kaczmarek&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar <small>(1973\u20131975; died 2008)</small>\n* [[Swanee (singer)|John Swan]]&nbsp;\u2013 percussion, backing vocals <small>(1975)</small>\n* [[Ray Arnott]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums <small>(1983\u20131984)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n;Additional musicians\n* Dave Blight&nbsp;\u2013 harmonica\n* Billy Rodgers&nbsp;\u2013 saxophone\n* Jimmy Sloggett&nbsp;\u2013 saxophone\n* Andy Bickers&nbsp;\u2013 saxophone\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Geyer]]&nbsp;\u2013 backing vocals\n* [[Venetta Fields]]&nbsp;\u2013 backing vocals\n* [[Megan Williams (actress)|Megan Williams]]&nbsp;\u2013 backing vocals\n* Peter Walker&nbsp;\u2013 acoustic guitar\n* [[Joe Camilleri]]&nbsp;\u2013 saxophone\n* [[Wilbur Wilde]]&nbsp;\u2013 saxophone\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Cold Chisel discography}}\n\n<!-- studio albums only here, go to Cold Chisel discography or nav-box below for other releases -->\n* ''[[Cold Chisel (album)|Cold Chisel]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Breakfast at Sweethearts]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Circus Animals]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Twentieth Century (Cold Chisel album)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[The Last Wave of Summer]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[No Plans]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[The Perfect Crime (Cold Chisel album)|The Perfect Crime]]'' (2015)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Music of Australia}}\n* [[Timeline of trends in Australian music]]\n* [[ARIA Hall of Fame]]\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;General\n* {{Cite encyclopedia | last = McFarlane | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian McFarlane | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | title = Whammo Homepage | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040405231007/http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | url = http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | archivedate = 5 April 2004 | accessdate = 3 October 2013 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 | date = | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }} Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality.\n;Specific\n{{Refend}}\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"McFarlane\">McFarlane, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040419101605/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=213 'Cold Chisel'] entry.

The Confederacy was originally formed by seven [[secession]]ist slave-holding [[U.S. state|states]]\u2014[[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], and [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]\u2014in the [[Deep South|Lower South]] region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation system]] that relied upon the labor of [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].<ref name=\"IndEcon\"/>\n\nEach state declared its secession from the United States, which became known as the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the ensuing [[American Civil War|civil war]], following the [[United States presidential election, 1860|November 1860 election]] of [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Before Lincoln took office in March, a new Confederate government was established in February 1861, which was considered illegal by the government of the United States. States volunteered militia units and the new government hastened to form its own [[Confederate States Army]] from scratch practically overnight. After the [[American Civil War]] began in April, four slave states of the [[Upper South]]\u2014[[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]]\u2014also declared their secession and joined the Confederacy.  The Confederacy later accepted [[Confederate government of Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Kentucky]] as members, although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces; Confederate [[wikt:shadow government|shadow governments]] attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them.\n\n[[File:US map 1864 Civil War divisions.svg|thumb|right|Map of the division of the states in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865).

Much of the Confederacy's infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraphs, railroads and bridges. Plantations in the path of Sherman's forces were severely damaged. Internal movement became increasingly difficult for Southerners, weakening the economy and limiting army mobility.<ref>Burke Davis, ''Sherman's march'' (2016) ch 1.</ref>\n\nThese losses created an insurmountable disadvantage in men, [[materiel]], and finance. Public support for Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]'s administration eroded over time due to repeated military reverses, economic hardships, and allegations of autocratic government. After four years of campaigning, Richmond was captured by Union forces in April 1865. A few days later General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], effectively signalling the collapse of the Confederacy. President Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, and jailed in preparation for a treason trial that was ultimately never held.<ref>Weigley (2000), p. 453.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:CSA states evolution.gif|thumb|upright=1.8|Evolution of the Confederate States, December 20, 1860 \u2013 July 15, 1870]]\nThe initial Confederacy was established in the [[Montgomery Convention]] in February 1861 by seven states ([[South Carolina in the Civil War|South Carolina]],  [[Mississippi in the Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Alabama in the Civil War|Alabama]], [[Florida in the Civil War|Florida]], [[Georgia in the Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the Civil War|Louisiana]], adding [[Texas in the Civil War|Texas]] in March before Lincoln's inauguration), expanded in May\u2013July 1861 (with [[Virginia in the Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the Civil War|Tennessee]], [[North Carolina in the Civil War|North Carolina]]), and was disintegrated in April\u2013May 1865. It was formed by delegations from seven slave states of the [[Lower South]] that had proclaimed their secession from the Union. After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted. Later, two slave states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress.

All had residents who cast significant numbers of Unionist votes in either the legislature, conventions, popular referendums, or in all three.

Craven in 1950, the Confederate States of America was created by [[Secession in the United States|secessionists]] in Southern slave states who believed that the federal government was making them second-class citizens and refused to honor their belief that [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was beneficial to the [[African American|Negro]].<ref name=\"autogenerated350\">Craven, Avery O., ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism. 1848\u20131861'' (1953). p. 350</ref> They judged the agent of change to be [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and anti-slavery elements in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], whom they believed used repeated insult and injury to subject them to intolerable \"humiliation and degradation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated350\"/> The \"Black Republicans\" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency. On the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old, and ailing.\n\nDuring [[United States presidential election, 1860|the campaign for president in 1860]], some secessionists threatened disunion should Lincoln (who opposed the expansion of slavery into the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]) be elected, most notably [[William L. Yancey]]. Yancey toured the North calling for secession as [[Stephen A.

A Lincoln victory presented them with a momentous choice (as they saw it), even before his inauguration \u2013 \"the Union without slavery, or slavery without the Union\".<ref>Craven. ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism''. p. 366.</ref>\n\n====Causes of secession====\nThe immediate catalyst for secession was the victory of the Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in the 1860 elections. American Civil War historian [[James M. McPherson]] suggested that, for the Southerners, the most ominous feature of the Republican victories in the Congressional and Presidential elections of 1860 was the magnitude of those victories. Republicans captured over 60 percent of the Northern vote, and won three-fourths of its Congressional delegations. The Southern press said that such Republicans represented the anti-slavery portion of the North, \"a party founded on the single sentiment&nbsp;... of hatred of African slavery\", and now the controlling power in national affairs. The \"Black Republican party\" could overwhelm conservative Yankees. ''The New Orleans Delta'' said of the Republicans, \"It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party\" to overthrow slavery.<ref>McPherson. pp. 232\u2013233.</ref>\n\nBy 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South relate primarily to the maintenance or expansion of [[slavery in the United States]]. Historian [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] observed that \"leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Faust |first= Drew Gilpin |authorlink= Drew Gilpin Faust |title= The Creation of Confederate Nationalism: Ideology and Identity in the Civil War South |year=1988 |publisher= Louisiana State University Press |location= Baton Rouge}}</ref> Although most white Southerners did not own slaves, the majority supported the institution of slavery and benefited in indirect ways from the slave society.

These efforts included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts. But after the Confederate attack and capture of [[Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, Lincoln called up [[75,000 volunteers|75,000 of the states' militia]] to muster under his command. The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment. The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration. Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion. The people of both North and South demanded war, and young men rushed to their colors in the hundreds of thousands. Four more states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) refused Lincoln's call for troops and declared secession, while Kentucky maintained an uneasy \"neutrality\".<ref name=\"Freehling\" />\n\n===Secession===\nSecessionists argued that the [[United States Constitution]] was a contract among sovereign states that could be abandoned at any time without consultation and that each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven [[Deep South]] cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861 (before Abraham Lincoln took office as president), while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Delegates from those seven formed the CSA in February 1861, selecting [[Jefferson Davis]] as the provisional president. Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.<ref>February 28, 1861, Congress authorized Davis to accept state militias into national service. Confederate Act of Congress for \"provisionals\" on March 6, 1861, authorized 100,000 militia and volunteers under Davis' command. May 6, Congress empowered Davis to accept volunteers directly without state intermediaries. Keegan, John.

The war for southern independence was surely to be fought in Virginia, but it also had the largest Southern military-aged white population, with infrastructure, resources and supplies required to sustain a war. The Davis Administration's policy was that, \"It must be held at all hazards.\"<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 101.

It was a great storehouse of supplies, food, feed, raw materials, and infrastructure of ports, drydocks, armories and the established Tredegar Iron Works.

Prices rose dramatically despite government efforts at price regulation. A movement in Congress led by [[Henry S. Foote]] of Tennessee argued for moving the capital from Richmond. At the approach of Federal armies in mid-1862, the government's archives were readied for removal.

In his report to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself, asserting the letter was \"a positive recognition of our Government\". The letter was indeed used in propaganda, but Confederate Secretary of State [[Judah P.

Merton Coulter]] noted that for those who would secure its independence, \"The Confederacy was unfortunate in its failure to work out a general strategy for the whole war\". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination \"dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond\". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a \"simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us\".<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Historian [[James M.

The enemy would be struck down by the same elements which so often debilitated or destroyed visitors and transplants in the South. Heat exhaustion, sunstroke, endemic diseases such as malaria and typhoid would match the destructive effectiveness of the Moscow winter on the [[French invasion of Russia|invading armies]] of Napoleon.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 348. \"The enemy could not hold territory, a hostile people would close in behind.

While armed, he does not have his sword drawn as he is depicted in the [[George Washington#Monuments and memorials|equestrian statue]] at the Virginia Capitol, Richmond, Virginia. The plates for the Great Seal were engraved in England but never received due to the Union Blockade.</ref>]]\n\nEarly in the war both sides believed that one great battle would decide the conflict; the Confederate won a great victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], also known as [[First Manassas]] (the name used by Confederate forces). It drove the Confederate people \"insane with joy\"; the public demanded a forward movement to capture Washington relocate the Confederate capital there, and admit [[Maryland in the Civil War|Maryland]] to the Confederacy.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 343</ref> A council of war by the victorious Confederate generals decided not to advance against larger numbers of fresh Federal troops in defensive positions. Davis did not countermand it. Following the Confederate incursion halted at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in October 1862, generals proposed concentrating forces from state commands to re-invade the north. Nothing came of it.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 346</ref> Again in early 1863 at his incursion into Pennsylvania, Lee requested of Davis that Beauregard simultaneously attack Washington with troops taken from the Carolinas. But the troops there remained in place during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]].\n\nThe eleven states of the Confederacy were outnumbered by the North about four to one in white men of military age. It was overmatched far more in military equipment, industrial facilities, railroads for transport, and wagons supplying the front.\n\nConfederate military policy innovated to slow the invaders, but at heavy cost to the Southern infrastructure. The Confederates burned bridges, laid land mines in the roads, and made harbors inlets and inland waterways unusable with sunken mines (called \"torpedos\" at the time). Coulter reports:\n{{quote|Rangers in twenty to fifty-man units were awarded 50% valuation for property destroyed behind Union lines, regardless of location or loyalty. As Federals occupied the South, objections by loyal Confederate concerning Ranger horse-stealing and indiscriminate scorched earth tactics behind Union lines led to Congress abolishing the Ranger service two years later.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 333\u2013338.</ref>}}\n\nThe Confederacy relied on external sources for war materials. The first came from trade with the enemy. \"Vast amounts of war supplies\" came through Kentucky, and thereafter, western armies were \"to a very considerable extent\" provisioned with illicit trade via Federal agents and northern private traders.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 286. After capture by Federals, [[Memphis, Tennessee#19th century|Memphis]], TN became a major source of supply for Confederate armies, comparable to Nassau and its [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]].</ref> But that trade was interrupted in the first year of war by [[David Dixon Porter|Admiral Porter]]'s river gunboats as they gained dominance along navigable rivers north\u2013south and east\u2013west.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 306. Confederate units harassed them throughout the war years by laying torpedo mines and loosing barrages from shoreline batteries.</ref> Overseas blockade running then came to be of \"outstanding importance\".<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287\u2013288. The principal ports on the Atlantic were [[Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War|Wilmington]], North Carolina, [[Charleston, South Carolina#Civil War|Charleston]], South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia for supplies from Europe via Bermuda and Nassau. On the Gulf were Galveston, Texas and [[New Orleans in the American Civil War|New Orleans]], Louisiana for those from Havana, Cuba and Mexican ports of Tampico and Vera Cruz.</ref> On April 17, President Davis called on privateer raiders, the \"militia of the sea\", to make war on U.S. seaborne commerce.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 296, 304. Two days later Lincoln proclaimed a blockade, declaring them pirates. Davis responded with [[letters of marque]] to protect privateers from outlaw status. Some of the early raiders were converted merchantmen seized in Southern ports at the outbreak of the war</ref> Despite noteworthy effort, over the course of the war the Confederacy was found unable to match the Union in ships and seamanship, materials and marine construction.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 299\u2013302. The [[Confederate Secret Service#Torpedo Bureau|Torpedo Bureau]] seeded defensive water-borne mines in principal harbors and rivers to compromise the Union naval superiority. These \"torpedoes\" were said to have caused more loss in U.S. naval ships and transports than by any other cause. Despite a rage for Congressional appropriations and public \"subscription ironclads\", armored platforms constructed in blockaded ports lacked the requisite marine engines to become ironclad warships. The armored platforms intended to become ironclads were employed instead as floating batteries for port city defense.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the greatest obstacle to success in the 19th-century warfare of mass armies was the Confederacy's lack of manpower, and sufficient numbers of disciplined, equipped troops in the field at the point of contact with the enemy. During the winter of 1862\u201363, Lee observed that none of his famous victories had resulted in the destruction of the opposing army. He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done. Lee explained, \"More than once have most promising opportunities been lost for want of men to take advantage of them, and victory itself had been made to put on the appearance of defeat, because our diminished and exhausted troops have been unable to renew a successful struggle against fresh numbers of the enemy.\"<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 321</ref>\n\n====Armed forces====\n{{Main|Military of the Confederate States of America}}\n\nThe military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches: [[Confederate States Army|Army]], [[Confederate States Navy|Navy]] and [[Confederate States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].\n\nThe Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] who had resigned their Federal commissions and had won appointment to senior positions in the Confederate armed forces. Many had served in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as [[Leonidas Polk]] (who graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] but did not serve in the Army) had little or no experience.\n\n<gallery style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Conf Navy Jack (light blue).svg |{{small|Navy Jack \u2013 light blue cross; also square [[Flag terminology|canton]], white [[Flag terminology|fly]]}}\nFile:North Virginia Third Bunting.svg |{{small|Battle Flag \u2013 square; also without center star}}\n</gallery>\n\nThe Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges (such as [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] and [[Virginia Military Institute]]) maintained cadet corps that trained Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at [[Drewry's Bluff]], Virginia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862blackCSN.htm|title=1862blackCSN|publisher=}}</ref> in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.\n\nThe soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar, ''Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee'' (2011) p. 3, ch 9</ref> In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments. A majority of those in uniform would not re-enlist following their one-year commitment, so on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted the first mass [[conscription]] on the North American continent. (The U.S. Congress followed a year later on March 3, 1863, with the [[Enrollment Act]].) Rather than a universal draft, the initial program was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions. These were narrowed as the war progressed. Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, \"engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties\".<ref>Coulter, E. Merton, ''The Confederate States of America: 1861\u20131865'', op. cit., p. 313\u2013315, 318.</ref> Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.<ref>[[Alfred L.

Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for \"local defense, not combat\".<ref>Rubin p. 104.</ref> Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In early 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee's and Davis's recommendations, the Congress refused \"to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers\". No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.<ref>Levine pp. 146\u2013147.</ref>\n\n=====Raising troops=====\n[[File:To Arms Confederate Enlistment Poster 1862.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Recruitment poster: \"Do not wait to be drafted\". Under half re-enlisted.]]\n\nThe immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the \"Provisional\" or \"Volunteer Army\". State governors resisted concentrating a national effort. Several wanted a strong state army for self-defense. Others feared large \"Provisional\" armies answering only to Davis.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&nbsp;308\u2013311. The patchwork recruitment was (a) with and without state militia enrolment, (b) state Governor sponsorship and direct service under Davis, (c) for under six months, one year, three years and the duration of the war. Davis proposed recruitment for some period of years or the duration. Congress and the states equivocated. Governor Brown of Georgia became \"the first and most persistent critic\" of Confederate centralized military and civil power.</ref> When filling the Confederate government's call for 100,000 men, another 200,000 were turned away by accepting only those enlisted \"for the duration\" or twelve-month volunteers who brought their own arms or horses.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nIt was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was \"greater than could have been reasonably expected\". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 328, 330\u2013332. About 90% of West Pointers in the U.S. Army resigned to join the Confederacy. Notably, of Virginia's West Pointers, not 90% but 70% resigned for the Confederacy. Exemplary officers without military training included [[John B. Gordon]], [[Nathan B. Forrest]], [[J. Johnston Pettigrew|James J. Pettigrew]], [[John Hunt Morgan|John H. Morgan]], [[Turner Ashby]] and [[John S. Mosby]]. Most preliminary officer training was had from Hardee's \"Tactics\", and thereafter by observation and experience in battle. The Confederacy had no officers training camps or military academies, although early on, cadets of the Virginia Military Institute and other military schools drilled enlisted troops in battlefield evolutions.</ref>\n\nAnticipating the need for more \"duration\" men, in January 1862 Congress provided for company level recruiters to return home for two months, but their efforts met little success on the heels of Confederate battlefield defeats in February.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&nbsp;310\u2013311. Early 1862 \"dried up the enthusiasm to volunteer\" due to the impact of victory's battle casualties, the humiliation of defeats and the dislike of camp life with its monotony, confinement and mortal diseases. Immediately following the great victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]], many believed the war was won and there was no need for more troops. Then the new year brought defeat over February 6\u201323: [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]], [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]], [[Fort Donelson]], Nashville \u2013 the first capital to fall. Among some not yet in uniform, the less victorious \"Cause\" seemed less glorious.</ref> Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall. States responded by passing their own draft laws.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 312. The government funded parades and newspaper ad campaigns, $2,000,000 for recruitment in Kentucky alone. With a state-enacted draft, Governor Brown with a quota of 12,000 raised 22,000 Georgia militia.</ref>\n\nThe veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire. Enlisted reorganization elections disintegrated the army for two months. Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not. Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October. The boards caused a \"rapid and widespread\" thinning out of 1700 incompetent officers. Troops thereafter would elect only second lieutenants.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 313, 332. Officially dropping 425 officers by board review in October was followed immediately by 1,300 \"resignations\". Some officers who resigned then served honorably as enlisted for the duration or until they were made casualties, others resigned and returned home until conscription.</ref>\n\nIn early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms. But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war. One [[Macon, Georgia]], newspaper asked how two million brave fighting men of the South were about to be overcome by four million northerners who were said to be cowards.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 313</ref>\n\n=====Conscription=====\n[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|right|Unionists throughout the Confederate States, resisted the 1862 conscription]]\nThe Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term. They would serve only in units and under officers of their state. Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&nbsp;313\u2013314. Military officers including Joseph E. Johnston and Robert E. Lee, advocated conscription. In the circumstances they persuaded Congressmen and newspaper editors. Some editors advocating conscription in early 1862 later became \"savage critics of conscription and of Davis for his enforcement of it: Yancey of Alabama, Rhett of the Charleston 'Mercury', Pollard of the Richmond 'Examiner', and Senator Wigfall of Texas\".</ref> The cry of \"rich man's war and a poor man's fight\" led Congress to abolish the substitute system altogether in December 1863. All principals benefiting earlier were made eligible for service. By February 1864, the age bracket was made 17 to 50, those under eighteen and over forty-five to be limited to in-state duty.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&nbsp;313\u2013314, 319. Apart from their respective system exemptions, populations under Federal administration were subject to a \"wheel of fortune\" draft by aggregate number from each state in each draft, rather than the Confederate's universal selection by age. Overrun areas such as Kentucky and Missouri were not subject to the draft, these areas expanded as the war progressed. The act abolishing the substitute system and nullifying the principal's exemption was challenged in court as a violation of contract, but \"no court of importance so held\".</ref>\n\nConfederate conscription was not universal; it was a selective service. The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness. The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection. Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 315\u2013317.</ref>\n\nRich men's sons were appointed to the socially outcast \"overseer\" occupation, but the measure was received in the country with \"universal odium\". The legislative vehicle was the controversial [[Twenty Negro Law]] that specifically exempted one white overseer or owner for every plantation with at least 20 slaves. Backpedalling six months later, Congress provided overseers under 45 could be exempted only if they held the occupation before the first Conscription Act.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 320. One such exemption was allowed for every 20 slaves on a plantation, the May 1863 reform required previous occupation and that the plantation of 20 slaves (or group of plantations within a five-mile area) had not been subdivided after the first exemption of April 1862.</ref> The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&nbsp;317\u2013318. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were also exempted. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. Some scholars such as Martis interpret this as robust democratic society in wartime. Coulter attributes the widely new found enthusiasm for political careers as a means to \"get out of the army or keep from getting into it\". State Governor patronage expanded most notably in the tens of thousands in Georgia and North Carolina. In Greene County, Georgia, two dozen men ran for three offices; in protest, the women of the county ran a ticket of three men older than the 45 years conscription age.</ref> By law, substitutes could not be subject to conscription, but instead of adding to Confederate manpower, unit officers in the field reported that over-50 and under-17-year-old substitutes made up to 90% of the desertions.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 319.</ref>\n<gallery style=\"float:right; text-align:center\" perrow=\"2\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Gabriel James Rains.jpg|Gen.

Pillow]], {{small|military recruiter under Bragg, then J.E. Johnston<ref>Coulter, \"The Confederates States of America\", p. 324.</ref>}}\n</gallery>\n\nThe Conscription Act of February 1864 \"radically changed the whole system\" of selection. It abolished industrial exemptions, placing detail authority in President Davis. As the shame of conscription was greater than a felony conviction, the system brought in \"about as many volunteers as it did conscripts.\" Many men in otherwise \"bombproof\" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform. Still there was shirking.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 322\u2013324, 326. The Conscription Bureau was run by Brigadier General [[Gabriel J. Rains]] until May 1863, Brigadier General [[Charles W. Field]] until July 1864, Colonel [[John S. Preston]] until \"the bitter end\". The \"odium and disgrace\" of conscription led many to volunteer. The Bureau was \"undoubtedly very inefficient\" as officers were culled from those unwanted for field service. Virginia had 26,000 volunteers to 9,000 conscripts. Governor Vance NC \"vigorously supported conscription\", uncharacteristically netting 21,343 conscripts to 8,000 volunteers. Necessary railroad positions once demeaned as \"blacks only\" were in 1864 taken by whites of military age.</ref> To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow. It had a checkered career of \"contention, opposition and futility\". Armies appointed alternative military \"recruiters\" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17\u201350-year-old conscripts and deserters. Nearly 3000 officers were tasked with the job. By late 1864, Lee was calling for more troops. \"Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable.\" By March 1865 conscription was to be administered by generals of the state reserves calling out men over 45 and under 18 years old. All exemptions were abolished. These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17\u201350, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids. The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards. April 1865 Lee surrendered an army of 50,000. Conscription had been a failure.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&nbsp;323\u2013325, 327. Those governors with constitutional reservations refused to participate in conscription. In Fall 1864, Lee required of Davis a total number of 150,000 to match Grant's numbers, \"else I fear a great calamity will befall us\". This led to Davis appointing officers such as General Pillow to recruiting positions. As a military recruiting officer, [[Gideon J. Pillow]] for whom [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow]], was named, brought in 25,000 for [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Joseph E. Johnston]].</ref>\n\nThe survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861\u201362, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, \"This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed [[libertarianism]]; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment.\"<ref>Rable (1994) p. 265.</ref>\n\n====Victories: 1861====\nThe American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with a Confederate victory at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]].\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n|image1=Bombardment of Fort Sumter(3b52027r).jpg|width1=180|caption1=Bombardment of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], Charleston, South Carolina\n|image2=MNBPRickettsBatteryPainting.jpg|width2=205|caption2=First Bull Run ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]), the North's \"Big Skedaddle\"<ref>[[Margaret Leech]], ''Reveille in Washington'' (1942)</ref>\n}}\n\nIn January, President [[James Buchanan]] had attempted to resupply the garrison with the steamship, ''[[Star of the West]]'', but Confederate artillery drove it away. In March, President Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor [[Francis W. Pickens|Pickens]] that without Confederate resistance to the resupply there would be no military reinforcement without further notice, but Lincoln prepared to force resupply if it were not allowed. Confederate President Davis, in cabinet, decided to seize Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived, and on April 12, 1861, General Beauregard forced its surrender.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Alexander H.|authorlink=Alexander Stephens|title=A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalview02steprich|format=PDF|volume=2|year=1870|page=36|quote=I maintain that it was inaugurated and begun, though no blow had been struck, when the hostile fleet, styled the 'Relief Squadron', with eleven ships, carrying two hundred and eighty-five guns and two thousand four hundred men, was sent out from New York and Norfolk, with orders from the authorities at Washington, to reinforce Fort Sumter peaceably, if permitted 'but forcibly if they must'&nbsp;...}} After the war, Confederate Vice President Alexander H.

In May, Federal troops crossed into Confederate territory along the entire border from the Chesapeake Bay to New Mexico. The first battles were Confederate victories at Big Bethel ([[Battle of Big Bethel|Bethel Church, Virginia]]), First Bull Run ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) in Virginia July and in August, Wilson's Creek ([[Battle of Wilson's Creek|Oak Hills]]) in Missouri. At all three, Confederate forces could not follow up their victory due to inadequate supply and shortages of fresh troops to exploit their successes. Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington, DC; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Springfield, Missouri. Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&nbsp;352\u2013353.</ref> Union General [[George B.

To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader on all fronts, costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n|image1=Battle of Antietam.jpg |width1=165|caption1=General Burnside halted at the bridge.

After some success against the Union blockade, in March the ironclad [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] was forced into port and burned by Confederates at their retreat. Despite several attempts mounted from their port cities, CSA naval forces were unable to break the Union blockade. Attempts were made by Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall]]'s ironclads from Savannah in 1862 with the [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']].<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287, 306, 302, 306 and [http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org11-2.htm CSS Atlanta, USS Atlanta. Navy Heritage]. In both events, as with the CSS ''Virginia'', the Navy's bravery and fighting skill was compromised in combat by mechanical failure in the engines or steering. The joint combined Army-Navy defense by General [[Robert E. Lee]], and his successor and Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall]], repelled amphibious assault of Savannah for the duration of the war. Union General [[Tecumseh Sherman]] captured Savannah from the land side in December 1864. The British blockade runner [[USS Atlanta (1861)#As Fingal|''Fingal'']] was purchased and converted to the ironclad [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']]. It made two sorties, was captured by Union forces, repaired, and returned to service as the ironclad USS ''Atlanta'' supporting Grant's [[Siege of Petersburg]].</ref> Secretary of the Navy [[Stephen Mallory]] placed his hopes in a European-built ironclad fleet, but they were never realized. On the other hand, four new English-built commerce raiders served the Confederacy, and several fast blockade runners were sold in Confederate ports. They were converted into commerce-raiding cruisers, and manned by their British crews.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 303. French shipyards built four corvettes, and two ironclad rams for the Confederacy, but the American minister prevented their delivery. British firms contracted to build two additional ironclad rams, but under threat from the U.S., the British government bought them for their own navy. Two of the converted blockade runners effectively raided up and down the Atlantic coast until the end of the war.</ref>\n\nIn the east, Union forces could not close on Richmond. General McClellan landed his army on the [[Peninsula Campaign|Lower Peninsula]] of Virginia. Lee subsequently ended that threat from the east, then Union General John Pope attacked overland from the north only to be repulsed at Second Bull Run ([[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Manassas]]). Lee's strike north was turned back at Antietam MD, then Union [[Ambrose Burnside|Major General Ambrose Burnside's]] offensive was disastrously ended at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] VA in December. Both armies then turned to winter quarters to recruit and train for the coming spring.<ref>Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 354\u2013356.

Confederate veterans had been temporarily disenfranchised by Reconstruction policy. The prewar South had many rich areas; the war left the entire region economically devastated by military action, ruined infrastructure, and exhausted resources. Continuing to be dependent on an agricultural economy and resisting investment in infrastructure, the region remained dominated by the planter elite into the 20th century. After 1890 the Democratic-dominated legislatures worked to secure their control by passing new constitutions and amendments at the turn of the 20th century that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites]]. This exclusion of blacks from the political system, and great weakening of the Republican Party, was generally maintained until  the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Rable wrote, \"But despite heated arguments and no little friction between the competing political cultures of unity and liberty, antiparty and broader fears about politics in general shaped civic life. These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices.&nbsp;... Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities. Only in North Carolina did there develop anything resembling a party system, and there the central values of the Confederacy's two political cultures had a far more powerful influence on political debate than did organizational maneuvering.\"</ref> Without a two-party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, \"negative, carping and petty\". The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, this lack of a functioning two-party system caused \"real and direct damage\" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=David Herbert |editor-last=Donald |title=Why the North Won the Civil War |year=1996 |pages=112\u2013113 }} Potter wrote in his contribution to this book, \"Where parties do not exist, criticism of the administration is likely to remain purely an individual matter; therefore the tone of the criticism is likely to be negative, carping, and petty, as it certainly was in the Confederacy. But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis.&nbsp;... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the [1863 Confederate mid-term] election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy.\"</ref>\n\n====\"Died of Davis\"====\nThe enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy \"died of Davis\". He was unfavorably compared to [[George Washington]] by critics such as [[Edward Alfred Pollard]], editor of the most influential newspaper the ''[[Richmond Examiner]]''.  Coulter summarizes, \"The American Revolution had its Washington; the Southern Revolution had its Davis&nbsp;... one succeeded and the other failed.\" Beyond the early honeymoon period, Davis was never popular. He unwittingly caused much internal dissension from early on. His ill health and temporary bouts of blindness disabled him for days at a time.<ref name=\"Coulter pp 105-06\">{{cite book |last=Coulter |title=Confederate States of America |pages=105\u2013106 }}</ref>\n\nCoulter says Davis was heroic and his will was indomitable. But his \"tenacity, determination, and will power\" stirred up lasting opposition of enemies Davis could not shake. He failed to overcome \"petty leaders of the states\" who made the term \"Confederacy\" into a label for tyranny and oppression, denying the \"[[Flags of the Confederate States of America#First National Flag (\"The Stars and Bars\") - 1861|Stars and Bars]]\" from becoming a symbol of larger patriotic service and sacrifice. Instead of campaigning to develop nationalism and gain support for his administration, he rarely courted public opinion, assuming an aloofness, \"almost like an Adams\".<ref name=\"Coulter pp 105-06\" />\n\nEscott argues that Davis was unable to mobilize Confederate nationalism in support of his government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Escott |title=After Secession: Jefferson Davis and the Failure of Confederate Nationalism |location= |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-8071-1807-9 }}</ref>\n\nDavis was not an efficient administrator. He attended to too many details. He protected his friends after their failures were obvious. He spent too much time on military affairs versus his civic responsibilities. Coulter concludes he was not the ideal leader for the Southern Revolution, but he showed \"fewer weaknesses than any other\" contemporary character available for the role.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coulter |title=Confederate States of America |pages=108, 113, 103 }}</ref> [[Robert E.

Much of the [[Confederate States Constitution]] replicated the [[United States Constitution]] verbatim, but it contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery including provisions for the recognition and protection of slavery in any territory of the Confederacy. It maintained the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|ban on international slave-trading]] while protecting the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|existing internal trade]] of slaves among slaveholding states.\n\nIn certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a [[commerce clause]], the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding [[internal improvement]]s in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's [[General Welfare clause|general welfare clause]] prohibited [[protective tariff]]s (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of \"carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States\" rather than providing for the \"general welfare\". State legislatures had the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] and a [[Supremacy Clause]] that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.\n\nThe Confederate Constitution did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state \"acting in its sovereign and independent character\" but also of the formation of a \"permanent federal government\". During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.<ref>Davis p. 248.</ref> The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God's blessing (\"...&nbsp;invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God&nbsp;...\").\n\n====Executive====\n{{main|President of the Confederate States of America}}\n\nThe Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met on February 4, 1861.

His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with its clear rationale for secession and his pleading for a peaceful departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known that he wanted to be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations. Stephens was inaugurated February 11, Davis February 18.<ref>Coulter, \"Confederate States of America\", pp.&nbsp;23\u201326.</ref>\n\nDavis and Stephens were elected President and Vice President, unopposed [[Confederate States presidential election, 1861|on November 6, 1861]]. They were inaugurated on February 22, 1862.\n\nHistorian E. M. Coulter observed, \"No president of the U.S. ever had a more difficult task.\" Washington was inaugurated in peacetime. Lincoln inherited an established government of long standing. The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative. Although they referred to their \"Revolution\", it was in their eyes more a counter-revolution against changes away from their understanding of U.S. founding documents. In Davis' inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule. The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.<ref>Coulter, \"Confederate States of America\", pp. 25, 27</ref>\n\nThe Permanent Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a [[line item veto]], a power also held by some state governors.\n\nThe Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds votes required in the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The only person to serve as president was [[Jefferson Davis]], due to the Confederacy being defeated before the completion of his term.\n\n====Administration and cabinet====\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:auto; text-align:left; white-space:nowrap; float:left; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DCDCDC; text-align:center;\" style=\"font-size:90%; colspan=\"3\" | The Davis Cabinet\n|-\n!{{smallcaps all|O|ffice}}\n!{{smallcaps all|N|ame}}\n!{{smallcaps all|T|erm}}\n|-\n!style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|[[President of the Confederate States of America|President]]\n![[Jefferson Davis]]\n|1861\u201365\n|-\n|[[Vice President of the Confederate States of America|Vice President]]\n![[Alexander H.

The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature. The Senate had two per state, twenty-six Senators. The House numbered 106 representatives apportioned by free and slave populations within each state. Two Congresses sat in six sessions until March 18, 1865.<ref>Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 1</ref>\n\nThe political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South. These in turn changed over time relative to Union occupation and disruption, the war impact on local economy, and the course of the war. Without political parties, key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property.

Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.\n\nWhen the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the [[front line]]s between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.<ref name=\"Moise, E.

One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of [[John H. Reagan]] to the position of Postmaster General, by [[Jefferson Davis]] in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office as well as a member of Davis' presidential cabinet.

The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade runners]] who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|Prisoner of War mail]]'' and ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade mail]]'' as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities.

Historian [[Mark E. Neely, Jr.|Mark Neely]] found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.<ref>Neely (1999) p. 1</ref> The Confederacy arrested pro-Union civilians in the South at about the same rate as the Union arrested pro-Confederate civilians in the North.<ref>Neely (1999) p. 172. Neely notes that. \"Most surprising of all, the Confederacy at a greater rate than the North arrested persons who held opposition political views at least in part because they held them, despite the Confederacy's vaunted lack of political parties. Such arrests were more common before 1863 while memories of the votes on secession remained fresh.\"</ref> Neely argues:\n\n{{quote|The Confederate citizen was not any freer than the Union citizen \u2013 and perhaps no less likely to be arrested by military authorities. In fact, the Confederate citizen may have been in some ways less free than his Northern counterpart. For example, freedom to travel within the Confederate states was severely limited by a domestic passport system.<ref>Neely (1993) pp. 11, 16.</ref>}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of the Confederate States of America}}\n\n===Slaves===\nAcross the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than loyalty to the old master; [[Bell I. Wiley|Bell Wiley]] says, \"It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom.\" Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bell Irvin |last=Wiley |title=Southern Negroes, 1861\u20131865 |year=1938 |pages=21, 66\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nLincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], an executive order of the U.S. government on January 1, 1863, changed the legal status of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". The long-term effect was that the Confederacy could not preserve the institution of slavery, and lost the use of the core element of its plantation labor force. Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation, and became free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Many freed slaves served as volunteers in the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.historynet.com/african-americans-in-the-civil-war|title= African Americans In The Civil War|work= History Net: Where History Comes Alive \u2013 World & US History Online}}</ref> Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.<ref>{{cite book |first=Leon F. |last=Litwack |title=Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1979 |pages=30\u201336, 105\u201366 |isbn=0-394-50099-7 }}</ref> By \"[[Juneteenth]]\" (June 19, 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all its slaves.

The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops. It supplied two-thirds of the world's cotton, which was in high demand for textiles, along with tobacco, sugar, and naval stores (such as turpentine). These raw materials were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast. Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, for cotton and tobacco depleted the soil. There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by outsiders.<ref>Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 13\u201314</ref><ref>R.

Most were concentrated in \"[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|black belt]]\" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves.) For decades there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war extra men were assigned to \"home guard\" patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, \"no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War.\" Nevertheless, slaves took the opportunity to enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many ran off to join them.<ref>{{cite book|author=William L.

One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and [[Economics of slavery|slaves]] living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way a mechanized family farm of free labor did in the North. The Southern economy was \"pre-capitalist\" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor market. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, and that meant labor management considerations apart from productivity.<ref>Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 12\u201315</ref>\n\nApproximately 85% of both North and South white populations lived on family farms, both regions were predominantly agricultural, and mid-century industry in both was mostly domestic. But the Southern economy was pre-capitalist in its overwhelming reliance on the agriculture of cash crops to produce wealth, while the great majority of farmers fed themselves and supplied a small local market. Southern cities and industries grew faster than ever before, but the thrust of the rest of the country's exponential growth elsewhere was toward urban industrial development along transportation systems of canals and railroads. The South was following the dominant currents of the American economic mainstream, but at a \"great distance\" as it lagged in the all-weather modes of transportation that brought cheaper, speedier freight shipment and forged new, expanding inter-regional markets.<ref>Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nA third count of southern pre-capitalist economy relates to the cultural setting. The South and southerners did not adopt a [[work ethic]], nor the habits of thrift that marked the rest of the country. It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture. The Southern Cause as a national economy in the Confederacy was grounded in \"slavery and race, planters and patricians, plain folk and folk culture, cotton and plantations\".<ref>Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' p. 16</ref>\n\n====National production====\n[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war; the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union]]\nThe Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and [[sugarcane]]. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of \"[[King Cotton]]\". When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production. All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.\n\nThe eleven states had produced $155 million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and [[naval stores]] such as turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots. Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Conn Bryan|title=Confederate Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeZr20kWbiAC&pg=PA106|year=2009|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|pages=105\u20139|isbn=9780820334998}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederacy adopted a [[tariff]] or tax on imports of 15%, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the United States.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/tariff/tariff.html Tariff of the Confederate States of America, May 21, 1861].</ref> The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5 million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was too little too late as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.<ref>Ian Drury, ed.

The two were hanged by Confederate authorities near the railroad tracks so passing train passengers could see them.]]\nIn peacetime, the South's extensive and connected systems of navigable rivers and coastal access allowed for cheap and easy transportation of agricultural products. The railroad system in the South had developed as a supplement to the navigable rivers to enhance the all-weather shipment of cash crops to market. Railroads tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits. In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union. Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.\n\nAt the onset of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in [[track gauge]] as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not use tracks of different gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a [[locomotive#Motive power|locomotive]] before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond.<ref name=\"Trains1\">{{cite journal|last1= Hankey|first1= John P.|year= 2011|title= The Railroad War|journal= Trains|publisher= Kalmbach Publishing Company|volume= 71|issue= 3|pages= 24\u201335 }}</ref> In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Due to this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.\n\nThe Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads. Southerners' refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<ref>Charles W. Ramsdell, \"The Confederate Government and the Railroads, ''American Historical Review'', (1917) 22#4 pp. 794\u2013810 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1836241 in JSTOR]</ref> Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In the early years of the war the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.<ref name=\"Ersatz\">Mary Elizabeth Massey. ''Ersatz in the Confederacy'' (1952) p. 128.</ref> Railroads came under the ''de facto'' control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.\n\nIn the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.<ref>Ramsdell, \"The Confederate Government and the Railroads\", pp. 809\u2013810.</ref>\n\n====Horses and mules====\nThe Confederate army experienced a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery.<ref>Spencer Jones, \"The Influence of Horse Supply Upon Field Artillery in the American Civil War\", ''Journal of Military History'', (April 2010), 74#2 pp 357\u2013377,</ref> Mules pulled the wagons.

The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.<ref>\nKeith Miller, \"Southern Horse\", ''Civil War Times'', (February 2006) 45#1 pp 30\u201336 [https://web.archive.org/web/20170605233123/http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&hid=18&sid=c4e9ecb5-83b8-46e6-a393-de91880f7354%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=ahl&AN=19359914 online]\n</ref>\n\n===Financial instruments===\nBoth the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed [[Confederate States of America dollar]]s as paper currency in various denominations, with a total face value of $1.5 billion. Much of it was signed by Treasurer [[Edward C. Elmore]]. Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless.

After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to [[Government debt|issuing debt]] and printing money to pay for war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Burdekin |first2=Farrokh |last2=Langdana |title=War Finance in the Southern Confederacy, 1861\u20131865 |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=352\u2013376 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/exeh.1993.1015 }}</ref> By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Wright |title=The Language of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aEJZRIxjDAC&pg=PA41 |year=2001 |page=41 |isbn=9781573561358 }}</ref>\n\nThe Confederate government took over the three national mints: the [[Charlotte Mint]] in North Carolina, the [[Dahlonega Mint]] in Georgia, and the [[New Orleans Mint]] in Louisiana. During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union. In New Orleans the Confederacy used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange.

Food that formerly came overland was cut off.\n\nWomen had charge of making do. They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee and it was hard to develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jessica Fordham |last=Kidd |title=Privation and Pride: Life in Blockaded Alabama |journal=Alabama Heritage Magazine |year=2006 |volume=82 |issue= |pages=8\u201315 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Mary Elizabeth |last=Massey |title=Ersatz in the Confederacy: Shortages and Substitutes on the Southern Homefront |year=1952 |pages=71\u201373 }}</ref>\n\nState governments pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food.

The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action.  Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida). These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves. By the time the fighting took place, undoubtedly some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul F. |last=Paskoff |title=Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy |journal=Civil War History |year=2008 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201362 |doi=10.1353/cwh.2008.0007 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery style=\"float:right; text-align:center\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:PottersHouseAtlanta1864.jpg |Potters House, Atlanta Ga\nFile:Charleston ruins.jpg|Downtown Charleston SC\nFile:Virginia, Norfolk Navy Yard, Ruins of - NARA - 533292.tif |Navy Yard, Norfolk Va\nFile:Ruins of Petersburg, R.R.

Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48 million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.<ref name=\"Paskoff, Measures of War\">Paskoff, \"Measures of War\"</ref>\n\nThe economic losses affected everyone. Banks and insurance companies were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer at the end of the war than at the beginning.<ref name=\"Paskoff, Measures of War\"/>\n\nThe rebuilding took years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war. Outside investment was essential, especially in railroads. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:<ref>{{cite book |first=John Samuel |last=Ezell |title=The South since 1865 |year=1963 |pages=27\u201328 }}</ref>\n<blockquote>One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes&nbsp;... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.</blockquote>\n\n===Effect on women and families===\n\n[[File:Confederate monument in Natchez, MS, Cemetery IMG 6995.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Confederate memorial [[tombstone]] at Natchez City Cemetery in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], [[Mississippi]]]]\n\nAbout 250,000 men never came home, some 30 percent of all white men aged 18 to 40, in 1860.

Variations of this design served as the Battle Flag of the Armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, and as the Confederate Naval Jack.]]\nThe first official flag of the Confederate States of America \u2013 called the \"Stars and Bars\" \u2013 originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states joined, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of Kentucky and Missouri). During the First Battle of Bull Run, ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the [[Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|Union flag]]. To rectify the situation, a separate \"Battle Flag\" was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the \"Southern Cross\", many variations sprang from the original square configuration. Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863. This new standard \u2013 known as the \"Stainless Banner\" \u2013 consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag canton. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.\n\nBecause of its depiction in the 20th-century and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag with the dark blue bars as being synonymous with \"the Confederate Flag\", but this flag was never adopted as a Confederate national flag. The \"Confederate Flag\" has a color scheme similar to the official Battle Flag, but is rectangular, not square. (Its design and shape matches the Naval Jack, but the blue bars are darker.) The \"Confederate Flag\" is a highly recognizable symbol of the South in the United States today, and continues to be a controversial icon.\n\n==Geography==\n===Region and climate===\nThe Confederate States of America claimed a total of {{convert|2919|mi|km}} of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The lower reaches of the [[Mississippi River]] bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]].

These differ in having bell-shaped flowers, the petals not being reflexed, and woodier stems, forming taller shrubs.\n\nSome plants of the completely unrelated genus ''[[Viburnum]]'' are sometimes called \"highbush cranberries\" (e.g. ''[[Viburnum trilobum]]'').\n\nCranberries are susceptible to false blossom, a harmful but controllable [[phytoplasma]] disease common in the eastern production areas of Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Vaccinum oxycoccos 120604.jpg|thumb|''Vaccinium oxycoccos'' flowers]]\nThe name, ''cranberry'', derives from the German, ''kraanbere'' (English translation, ''craneberry''), first named as ''cranberry'' in English by the missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] in 1647.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Cranberry (''Vaccinium macrocarpon'') : FAQ |url=https://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/c.php?g=177896&p=1169823 |publisher=Research Guides, University of Wisconsin Libraries, Madison, WI |accessdate=7 December 2017 |date=2017}}</ref> Around 1694, German and Dutch [[colonist]]s in [[New England]] used the word, cranberry, to represent the expanding flower, stem, [[calyx (flower)|calyx]], and petals resembling the neck, head, and bill of a [[crane (bird)|crane]].<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite web |title=Cranberry |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cranberry |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper |accessdate=7 December 2017 |date=2017}}</ref><ref name=\"aps\">{{cite web |author1=Caruso FL |author2=Bristow PR |author3=Oudemans PV |title=Cranberries: The Most Intriguing Native North American Fruit |url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Cranberries.aspx |publisher=American Phytopathological Society |accessdate=7 December 2017 |doi=10.1094/APSnetFeature-2000-1100 |date=2000}}</ref> The traditional English name for the plant more common in Europe, ''Vaccinium oxycoccos'', '''[[:ang:Fenber\u021de|fenberry]]''', originated from plants with small red berries found growing in [[fen]] (marsh) lands of England.<ref name=oed/>\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Jonathan eastman johnson cranberry harvest.jpg|thumb|''The Cranberry Harvest on the Island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]'', [[Eastman Johnson]], 1880.]]\n\nIn North America, the [[Narragansett people]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian nation]] in the regions of New England appeared to be using cranberries in [[pemmican]] for food and for [[dye]].<ref name=aps/> Calling the red berries, ''sasemineash'', the Narragansett people may have introduced cranberries to colonists in [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=aps/> In 1550, James White Norwood made reference to Native Americans using cranberries. In James Rosier's book ''The Land of Virginia'' there is an account of Europeans coming ashore and being met with Native Americans bearing bark cups full of cranberries. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is a 1633 account of the husband of Mary Ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings. In 1643, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s book ''[[A Key Into the Language of America]]'' described cranberries, referring to them as \"bearberries\" because bears ate them. In 1648, preacher John Elliott was quoted in [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard's]] book ''Clear Sunshine of the Gospel'' with an account of the difficulties the Pilgrims were having in using the Indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish. In 1663, the Pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce. In 1667, New Englanders sent to [[Charles II of England|King Charles]] ten barrels of cranberries, three barrels of codfish and some Indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the Pine Tree shilling. In 1669, Captain Richard Cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to Mary Gorham and his election to the Convention of Assistance), serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries. In the 1672 book ''New England Rarities Discovered'' author [[John Josselyn]] described cranberries, writing:\n\n<blockquote>Sauce for the Pilgrims, cranberry or bearberry, is a small trayling [''[[sic]]''] plant that grows in salt marshes that are overgrown with moss. The berries are of a pale yellow color, afterwards red, as big as a cherry, some perfectly round, others oval, all of them hollow with sower [''sic''] astringent taste; they are ripe in August and September. They are excellent against the Scurvy. They are also good to allay the fervor of hoof diseases. The Indians and English use them mush, boyling [''sic''] them with sugar for sauce to eat with their meat; and it is a delicate sauce, especially with roasted mutton. Some make tarts with them as with gooseberries.</blockquote>\n\n''The Compleat Cook's Guide'', published in 1683, made reference to cranberry juice. In 1703, cranberries were served at the Harvard University commencement dinner. In 1787, [[James Madison]] wrote [[Thomas Jefferson]] in France for background information on constitutional government to use at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson sent back a number of books on the subject and in return asked for a gift of apples, pecans and cranberries. [[William Aiton]], a Scottish botanist, included an entry for the cranberry in volume II of his 1789  work ''[[Hortus Kewensis]]''. He notes that ''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]'' (American cranberry) was cultivated by James Gordon in 1760. In 1796, cranberries were served at the first celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims, and Amelia Simmons (an American orphan) wrote a book entitled ''American Cookery'' which contained a recipe for cranberry tarts.\n\n[[American Revolutionary War]] veteran [[Henry Hall (American)|Henry Hall]] first cultivated cranberries in the [[Cape Cod]] town of [[Dennis (CDP), Massachusetts|Dennis]] around 1816.<ref name=aps/> In the 1820s, Hall was shipping cranberries to [[New York City]] and [[Boston]] from which shipments were also sent to Europe.<ref name=aps/> In 1843, [[Eli Howes]] planted his own crop of cranberries on Cape Cod, using the \"Howes\" variety.

Today's cranberry beds are constructed in upland areas with a shallow water table. The topsoil is scraped off to form [[dyke (construction)|dykes]] around the bed perimeter. Clean sand is hauled in and spread to a depth of four to eight inches (10 to 20 centimeters). The surface is [[laser level]]ed flat to provide even drainage. Beds are frequently drained with socked tile in addition to the perimeter ditch. In addition to making it possible to hold water, the dykes allow equipment to service the beds without driving on the vines. Irrigation equipment is installed in the bed to provide [[irrigation]] for vine growth and for spring and autumn frost protection.\n\nA common misconception about cranberry production is that the beds remain flooded throughout the year. During the [[growing season]] cranberry beds are not flooded, but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture. Beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures. In cold climates like Wisconsin, [[New England]], and eastern Canada, the winter flood typically freezes into ice, while in warmer climates the water remains liquid. When ice forms on the beds, trucks can be driven onto the ice to spread a thin layer of sand to control pests and rejuvenate the vines. Sanding is done every three to five years.\n\n=== Propagation ===\nCranberry vines are propagated by moving vines from an established bed. The vines are spread on the surface of the sand of the new bed and pushed into the sand with a blunt disk. The vines are watered frequently during the first few weeks until roots form and new shoots grow. Beds are given frequent, light application of nitrogen fertilizer during the first year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Carolyn J. DeMoranville |author2=Hilary A. Sandler |author3=Frank L.

Child Labor, Cranberry Bog, 1939.jpg|thumbnail|upright||left|[[Arthur Rothstein]], ''Child Labor, Cranberry Bog'', 1939. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Harvesting cranberries 2.jpg|thumb|Cranberry harvest (wet-picking)]]\nCranberries are harvested in the fall when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color. Berries that receive sun turn a deep red when fully ripe, while those that do not fully mature are a pale pink or white color. This is usually in September through the first part of November. To harvest cranberries, the beds are flooded with six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of water above the vines. A harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines. For the past 50 years, water reel type harvesters have been used. Harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed. From the farm, cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are cleaned, sorted, and stored prior to packaging or processing.\n\nAlthough most cranberries are wet-picked as described above, 5\u201310% of the US crop is still dry-picked. This entails higher labor costs and lower yield, but dry-picked berries are less bruised and can be sold as fresh fruit instead of having to be immediately frozen or processed. Originally performed with two-handed comb scoops, dry picking is today accomplished by motorized, walk-behind harvesters which must be small enough to traverse beds without damaging the vines.\n\nWhite [[cranberry juice]] is made from regular cranberries that have been harvested after the fruits are mature, but before they have attained their characteristic dark red color. Yields are lower on beds harvested early and the early flooding tends to damage vines, but not severely.\n\nCranberries for fresh market are stored in shallow bins or boxes with perforated or slatted bottoms, which deter decay by allowing air to circulate. Because harvest occurs in late autumn, cranberries for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration. Temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed. Cranberries destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station.\n\n==Production==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; clear:left; width:18em;\"\n! colspan=2|Cranberry production \u2013 2016\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:75%;\"| Country\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:25%;\"| <small>[[tonne]]s</small>\n|-\n| <center>{{USA}}</center> || <center>399,734</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{CAN}}</center> || <center>163,812</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{CHL}}</center> || <center>103,475</center>\n|-\n| <center>'''World'''</center> || <center>'''683,671'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=2|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]</small><ref name=\"faostat16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Cranberry production in 2016, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2017|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn 2016, world production of cranberry was 683,671 tonnes, mainly by the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Chile]], which collectively accounted for 98% of the global total (table).<ref name=faostat16 /> [[Wisconsin]] (65% of US production) and [[Quebec]] were the two largest regional producers of cranberries in [[North America]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada: Increase in cranberry production |url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/172504/Canada-Increase-in-cranberry-production/ |publisher=FreshPlaza |accessdate=18 October 2018 |date=17 March 2017}}</ref> Cranberries are also a major commercial crop in [[Massachusetts]] (23% of US production), [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Cranberry cultivation |url=http://www.uscranberries.com/about-cranberries/cultivation/ |publisher=US Cranberries |accessdate=18 October 2018 |date=2018}}</ref> as well as in the Canadian provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].\n\n== Food uses ==\n\n===Products===\n[[File:Dried-Cranberries.png|thumb|left|Dried cranberries]]\nAs fresh cranberries are hard, sour, and bitter, about 95% of cranberries are processed and used to make [[cranberry juice]] and sauce.

American cranberry growers have a long history of cooperative [[marketing]]. As early as 1904, John Gaynor, a [[Wisconsin]] grower, and A.U. Chaney, a fruit broker from [[Des Moines, Iowa]], organized Wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the Wisconsin Cranberry Sales Company to receive a uniform price from buyers. Growers in [[New Jersey]] and [[Massachusetts]] were also organized into cooperatives, creating the National Fruit Exchange that marketed fruit under the [[Eatmor]] [[brand]]. The success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure. With consistent and high prices, area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell.\n\nWith surplus cranberries and changing American households some enterprising growers began [[canning]] cranberries that were below-grade for fresh market. [[Competition]] between canners was fierce because [[profit (accounting)|profits]] were thin. The [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] cooperative was established in 1930 through a merger of three primary processing companies: Ocean Spray Preserving company, Makepeace Preserving Co, and Cranberry Products Co. The new company was called Cranberry Canners, Inc. and used the Ocean Spray label on their products. Since the new company represented over 90% of the market, it would have been illegal (cf. [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]]) had [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] John Quarles not found an exemption for [[agricultural cooperative]]s. Morris April Brothers were the producers of Eatmor brand cranberry sauce, in Tuckahoe, New Jersey; Morris April Brothers brought an action against Ocean Spray for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and won $200,000 in real damages plus triple damages, in 1958, just in time for the Great Cranberry Scare of 1959.  {{as of|2006}}, about 65% of the North American industry belongs to the Ocean Spray cooperative. (The percentage may be slightly higher in Canada than in the U.S.)\n\nA turning point for the industry occurred on 9 November 1959, when the secretary of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] [[Arthur S. Flemming]] announced that some of the 1959 crop was tainted with traces of the [[herbicide]] [[aminotriazole]]. The market for cranberries collapsed and growers lost millions of dollars.<ref name=\"zeldes\" /><ref>{{cite web |author=Dashiell Asher |date=21 September 2011 |url=http://thatsongblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/angry-songs-about-food-vol1-cranberry.html |title=Angry Songs About Food Vol.1 - Cranberry Blues |quote=In 1959 there was a deadly cranberry shortage.

Which of course lead to the creation of Cranberry Blues by Robert Williams and The Groovers! |accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref> However, the scare taught the industry that they could not be completely dependent on the holiday market for their products: they had to find year-round markets for their fruit. They also had to be exceedingly careful about their use of [[pesticide]]s. After the aminotriazole scare, Ocean Spray reorganized and spent substantial sums on [[product development]]. New products such as cranberry/apple [[juice]] blends were introduced, followed by other juice blends.\n\nA [[Federal Marketing Order]] that is authorized to synchronize supply and demand was approved in 1962. The order has been renewed and modified slightly in subsequent years, but it has allowed for more stable marketing. The market order has been invoked during six crop years: 1962 (12%), 1963 (5%), 1970 (10%), 1971 (12%), 2000 (15%), and 2001 (35%). Even though supply still exceeds demand, there is little will to invoke the Federal Marketing Order out of the realization that any pullback in supply by U.S. growers would easily be filled by Canadian production.\n\nPrices and production increased steadily during the 1980s and 1990s. Prices peaked at about $65.00 per barrel ({{cvt|0.65|$/lb|$/kg|2 |disp=or}})\u2014a cranberry barrel equals {{convert|100|lb|kg |sigfig=3 |disp=or|abbr=off}}. in 1996 then fell to $18.00 per barrel ({{cvt|0.18|$/lb|$/kg|2 |disp=or}}) in 2001. The cause for the precipitous drop was classic oversupply. Production had outpaced consumption leading to substantial inventory in freezers or as concentrate.\n\nCranberry handlers (processors) include [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], [[Cliffstar|Cliffstar Corporation]], Northland Cranberries Inc.[Sun Northland LLC], Clement Pappas & Co., and Decas Cranberry Products as well as a number of small handlers and processors.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Roper TR, Vorsa N |chapter=Cranberry: Botany and Horticulture |editor=Janick J |title=Horticultural Reviews |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=215\u20136 |isbn=0-471-18907-3 |url=http://www.pubhort.org/hr/hr21/HR_21_07_00000000.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Cranberry Marketing Committee====\nThe Cranberry Marketing Committee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscranberries.com/About/|title=About the Cranberry Marketing Committee|publisher=US Cranberry Marketing Committee|date=2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> is an organization that represents United States cranberry growers in four marketing order districts. The committee was established in 1962 as a Federal Marketing Order to ensure a stable, orderly supply of good quality product. The Cranberry Marketing Committee, based in Wareham, Massachusetts, represents more than 1,100 cranberry growers and 60 cranberry handlers across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and New York ([[Long Island]]). The authority for the actions taken by the Cranberry Marketing Committee is provided in Chapter IX, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations which is called the Federal Cranberry Marketing Order. The Order is part of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, identifying cranberries as a commodity good that can be regulated by Congress.  The Federal Cranberry Marketing Order has been altered over the years to expand the Cranberry Marketing Committee's ability to develop projects in the United States and around the world. The Cranberry Marketing Committee currently runs promotional programs in the United States, China, India, Mexico, Pan-Europe, and South Korea.\n\n===International trade===\n{{as of|2016}}, the [[European Union]] was the largest importer of American cranberries, followed individually by Canada, China, Mexico, and South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cranberries: No Longer Just an American Tradition|url=https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/cranberries-no-longer-just-american-tradition|publisher=Foreign Agricultural Service, US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=4 November 2017|date=22 November 2016}}</ref> From 2013 to 2017, US cranberry exports to China grew exponentially, making China the second largest country importer, reaching $36 million in cranberry products.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title= Beyond Thanksgiving: The Humble Cranberry Takes Root in China |publisher= the Wall Street Journal |location= New York |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-thanksgiving-the-humble-cranberry-takes-root-in-china-1509793203|author=Jennifer Levitz|date=4 November 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=Stac10>{{Citation |last=Stace |first=Clive |authorlink = Clive Stace |year=2010 |title=New Flora of the British Isles |edition=3rd |publication-place=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70772-5 |page=512}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Books\n* Cole, S. & Gifford, L.

Coverage criteria are usually defined as rules or requirements, which a test suite needs to satisfy.<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul Ammann, Jeff Offutt | title=Introduction to Software Testing |publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Basic coverage criteria ===\nThere are a number of coverage criteria, the main ones being:<ref>{{cite book | author=Glenford J. Myers | title=The Art of Software Testing, 2nd edition |publisher=Wiley | year=2004| isbn=0-471-46912-2}}</ref>\n* '''Function coverage'''{{snd}}Has each function (or [[subroutine]]) in the program been called?\n* '''Statement coverage'''{{snd}}Has each [[statement (computer science)|statement]] in the program been executed?\n* '''Branch coverage'''{{snd}}Has each branch (also called [[DD-path]]) of each control structure (such as in [[Conditional (programming)|''if'' and ''case'' statements]]) been executed?  For example, given an ''if'' statement, have both the true and false branches been executed?  Another way of saying this is, has every [[Graph theory|edge]] in the program been executed?\n* '''Condition coverage''' (or predicate coverage){{snd}}Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?\n\nFor example, consider the following C function:\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nint foo (int x, int y)\n{\n    int z = 0;\n    if ((x > 0) && (y > 0))\n    {\n        z = x;\n    }\n    return z;\n}\n</source>\n\nAssume this function is a part of some bigger program and this program was run with some test suite. \n* If during this execution function 'foo' was called at least once, then ''function coverage'' for this function is satisfied.\n* ''Statement coverage'' for this function will be satisfied if it was called e.g. as <code>foo(1,1)</code>, as in this case, every line in the function is executed including <code>z = x;</code>.\n* Tests calling <code>foo(1,1)</code> and <code>foo(0,1)</code> will satisfy ''branch coverage'' because, in the first case, both <code>if</code> conditions are met and <code>z = x;</code> is executed, while in the second case, the first condition <code>(x>0)</code> is not satisfied, which prevents executing <code>z = x;</code>.  \n* ''Condition coverage'' can be satisfied with tests that call <code>foo(1,0)</code> and <code>foo(0,1)</code>. These are necessary because in the first cases, <code>(x>0)</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, while in the second, it evaluates <code>false</code>. At the same time, the first case makes <code>(y>0)</code> <code>false</code>, while the second makes it <code>true</code>.\n\nCondition coverage does not necessarily imply branch coverage. For example, consider the following fragment of code:\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\nif a and b then\n</source>\nCondition coverage can be satisfied by two tests:\n* <code>a=true</code>, <code>b=false</code>\n* <code>a=false</code>, <code>b=true</code>\nHowever, this set of tests does not satisfy branch coverage since neither case will meet the <code>if</code> condition.\n\n[[Fault injection]] may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of [[exception handling]] code have adequate coverage during testing.\n\n=== Modified condition/decision coverage ===\n{{Main article|Modified Condition/Decision Coverage}}\nA combination of function coverage and branch coverage is sometimes also called\n'''decision coverage'''. This criterion requires that every point of entry and exit in the program has been invoked at least once, and every decision in the program has taken on all possible outcomes at least once. In this context the decision is a boolean expression composed of conditions and zero or more boolean operators. This definition is not the same as branch coverage,<ref name =\"Position Paper CAST10\">Position Paper CAST-10 (June 2002). ''[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/cast/cast_papers/media/cast-10.pdf What is a \"Decision\" in Application of Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) and Decision Coverage (DC)?]''</ref> however, some do use the term ''decision coverage'' as a synonym for ''branch coverage''.<ref name=\"mathworks\">MathWorks. ''[http://www.mathworks.com/help/slvnv/ug/types-of-model-coverage.html Types of Model Coverage.'']</ref>\n\n'''Condition/decision coverage''' requires that both decision and condition coverage be satisfied. However, for [[safety-critical]] applications (e.g., for avionics software) it is often required that '''modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)''' be satisfied. This criterion extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently. For example, consider the following code:\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\nif (a or b) and c then\n</source>\nThe condition/decision criteria will be satisfied by the following set of tests:\n* a=true, b=true, c=true\n* a=false, b=false, c=false\nHowever, the above tests set will not satisfy modified condition/decision coverage, since in the first test, the value of 'b' and in the second test the value of 'c' would not influence the output. So, the following test set is needed to satisfy MC/DC:\n* a=false,  b=true,  c='''false'''\n* a=false, b='''true''',  c='''true'''\n* a='''false''', b='''false''', c=true\n* a='''true''',  b=false, c='''true'''\n\n=== Multiple condition coverage ===\nThis criterion requires that all combinations of conditions inside each decision are tested. For example, the code fragment from the previous section will require eight tests:\n* a=false, b=false, c=false\n* a=false, b=false, c=true\n* a=false, b=true, c=false\n* a=false, b=true, c=true\n* a=true, b=false, c=false\n* a=true, b=false, c=true\n* a=true, b=true, c=false\n* a=true, b=true, c=true\n\n=== Parameter value coverage ===\n'''Parameter value coverage''' (PVC) requires that in a method taking parameters, all the common values for such parameters be considered. \nThe idea is that all common possible values for a parameter are tested.<ref>[http://www.rhyous.com/2012/05/08/unit-testing-with-parameter-value-coverage-pvc/ Unit Testing with Parameter Value Coverage (PVC)]</ref> For example, common values for a string are: 1) null, 2) empty, 3) whitespace (space, tabs, newline), 4) valid string, 5) invalid string, 6) single-byte string, 7) double-byte string. It may also be appropriate to use very long strings. Failure to test each possible parameter value may leave a bug. Testing only one of these could result in  100% code coverage as each line is covered, but as only one of seven options are tested, there is only 14.2% PVC.\n\n=== Other coverage criteria ===\nThere are further coverage criteria, which are used less often:\n* '''[[Linear Code Sequence and Jump]] (LCSAJ) coverage''' a.k.a.

Any module with a succession of <math>n</math> decisions in it can have up to <math>2^n</math> paths within it; loop constructs can result in an infinite number of paths.  Many paths may also be infeasible, in that there is no input to the program under test that can cause that particular path to be executed.  However, a general-purpose algorithm for identifying infeasible paths has been proven to be impossible (such an algorithm could be used to solve the [[halting problem]]).<ref>Dorf, Richard C.: ''Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices'', Chapter 12, pg. 15.

This allows testing parts of the target software that are rarely or never accessed under normal conditions, and helps reassure that the most important conditions (function points) have been tested.  The resulting output is then analyzed to see what areas of code have not been exercised and the tests are updated to include these areas as necessary. Combined with other test coverage methods, the aim is to develop a rigorous, yet manageable, set of regression tests.\n\nIn implementing test coverage policies within a software development environment, one must consider the following:\n\n*  What are coverage requirements for the end product certification and if so what level of test coverage is required?  The typical level of rigor progression is as follows: Statement, Branch/Decision, [[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage]](MC/DC), LCSAJ ([[Linear Code Sequence and Jump]])\n*  Will coverage be measured against tests that verify requirements levied on the system under test ([[DO-178B]])?\n*  Is the object code generated directly traceable to source code statements?  Certain certifications, (i.e. DO-178B Level A) require coverage at the assembly level if this is not the case: \"Then, additional verification should be performed on the object code to establish the correctness of such generated code sequences\" ([[DO-178B]]) para-6.4.4.2.<ref name=\"DO-178B\" />\n\nSoftware authors can look at test coverage results to devise additional tests and input or configuration sets to increase the coverage over vital functions. Two common forms of test coverage are statement (or line) coverage and branch (or edge) coverage. Line coverage reports on the execution footprint of testing in terms of which lines of code were executed to complete the test. Edge coverage reports which branches or code decision points were executed to complete the test. They both report a coverage metric, measured as a percentage. The meaning of this depends on what form(s) of coverage have been used, as 67% branch coverage is more comprehensive than 67% statement coverage.\n\nGenerally, test coverage tools incur computation and logging in addition to the actual program thereby slowing down the application, so typically this analysis is not done in production.  As one might expect, there are classes of software that cannot be feasibly subjected to these coverage tests, though a degree of coverage mapping can be approximated through analysis rather than direct testing.\n\nThere are also some sorts of defects which are affected by such tools. In particular, some [[race condition]]s or similar [[Real-time computing|real time]] sensitive operations can be masked when run under test environments; and conversely, and reliably, some of these defects may become easier to find as a result of the additional overhead of the testing code.\n\n==Usage in industry==\nTest coverage is one consideration in the safety certification of avionics equipment. The guidelines by which avionics gear is certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) is documented in [[DO-178B]]<ref name=\"DO-178B\">RTCA/[[DO-178B]], ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics,'' December 1, 1992</ref> and [[DO-178C]].<ref name=\"DO-178C\">RTCA/[[DO-178C]], ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics,'' January, 2012.</ref>\n\nTest coverage is also a requirement in part 6 of the automotive safety standard [[ISO 26262]] ''Road Vehicles - Functional Safety''.<ref name=\"ISO26262part6\">{{cite book | title =ISO 26262-6:2011(en)  Road vehicles -- Functional safety -- Part 6: Product development at the software level | publisher =International Standardization Organization | url =http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51362}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Software Testing}}\n* [[Cyclomatic complexity]]\n* [[Intelligent verification]]\n* [[Linear Code Sequence and Jump]]\n* [[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage]]\n* [[Mutation testing]]\n* [[Regression testing]]\n* [[Software metric]]\n* [[Static code analysis]]\n* [[White box testing]]\n* [[Java code coverage tools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Code Coverage}}\n[[Category:Software testing]]\n[[Category:Software metrics]]\n[[Category:Software testing tools]]", "sha1": "gx9ao5wyfan23zvqi6wxreueb339jof"}}, {"title": "Charles Xavier Joseph De Franque Ville Abancourt", "ns": "0", "id": "7032", "redirect": {"title": "Charles d'Abancour"}, "revision": {"id": "69980277", "parentid": "15905133", "timestamp": "2006-08-16T09:10:16Z", "contributor": {"username": "RebelRobot", "id": "1811786"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Charles d'Abancour]]", "sha1": "7hhzuag3vsghyvw7fyk10l12qzcjx4c"}}, {"title": "Caitlin Clarke", "ns": "0", "id": "7033", "revision": {"id": "851084844", "parentid": "846332256", "timestamp": "2018-07-19T23:22:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "Therequiembellishere", "id": "1522828"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{No footnotes|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name          = Caitlin Clarke\n| image         = CaitlinClarke.jpg\n| caption       = Clarke in ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981)\n| birth_name     = Katherine Anne Clarke\n| birth_date     = {{Birth date|1952|5|3}}\n| birth_place    = [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, U.S.\n| death_date     = {{Death date and age|2004|9|9|1952|5|3}}\n| death_place    = [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania]], U.S.\n| occupation    = actor, instructor\n| years_active   = 1978\u20132001\n| education     = [[Mount Holyoke College]] {{small|([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]])}}<br>[[Yale University]] {{small|([[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]])}}\n}}\n\n'''Caitlin Clarke''' (May 3, 1952 \u2013 September 9, 2004) was an American theater and film actress best known for her role as Valerian in the 1981 fantasy film ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' and for her role as Charlotte Cardoza in the 1998\u20131999 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Titanic (musical)|Titanic]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nClarke was born '''Katherine Anne Clarke''' in [[Pittsburgh]], the oldest of five sisters, the youngest of whom is [[Victoria Clarke]].

The Guards guided-missile cruiser Varyag underway at sea.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Russian {{sclass-|Slava|cruiser|2}} ''Varyag'' in the Pacific Ocean]]\n\nA '''cruiser''' is a type of [[warship]]. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the [[Age of Sail]], the term ''cruising'' referred to certain kinds of missions \u2013 independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding \u2013 fulfilled by a [[frigate]] or [[sloop-of-war]], which were the ''cruising warships'' of a fleet. Modern cruisers are generally the largest ships in a fleet after [[aircraft carrier]]s, and can usually perform several roles.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, ''cruiser'' came to be a classification for the ships intended for cruising distant waters, commerce raiding, and scouting for the battle fleet. Cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the medium-sized [[protected cruiser]] to large [[armored cruiser]]s that were nearly as big (although not as powerful or as well-armored) as a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =277 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}</ref> With the advent of the [[dreadnought battleship]] before [[World War I]], the armored cruiser evolved into a vessel of similar scale known as the battlecruiser. The very large [[battlecruiser]]s of the World War I era that succeeded armored cruisers were now classified, along with dreadnought battleships, as [[capital ship]]s.\n\nBy the early 20th century after World War I, the direct successors to protected cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a battleship but larger than a [[destroyer]]. In 1922, the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] placed a formal limit on these cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8&nbsp;inches in calibre; [[heavy cruiser]]s had 8-inch guns, while those with guns of 6.1 inches or less were [[light cruiser]]s, which shaped cruiser design until the end of World War II. Some variations on the Treaty cruiser design included the German {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|0}} \"pocket battleships\" which had heavier armament at the expense of speed compared to standard heavy cruisers, and the American {{sclass-|Alaska|cruiser|4}}, which was a scaled-up heavy cruiser design designated as a \"cruiser-killer\".\n\nIn the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant after the aircraft carrier. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including [[air defense]] and [[shore bombardment]]. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Navy's cruisers had heavy [[anti-ship missile]] armament designed to sink [[NATO]] carrier task forces via [[saturation attack]]. The U.S. Navy built guided-missile cruisers upon destroyer-style hulls (some called \"[[destroyer leader]]s\" or \"[[Frigate#Guided-missile role|frigates]]\" prior to the [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification|1975 reclassification]]) primarily designed to provide air defense while often adding [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine capabilities]], being larger and having longer-range [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) than early ''[[Charles F. Adams-class destroyer|Charles F. Adams]]'' [[guided-missile destroyer]]s tasked with the [[short-range air defense]] role. By the end of the Cold War, the line between cruisers and destroyers had blurred, with the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} cruiser using the hull of the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|0}} destroyer but receiving the cruiser designation due to their enhanced mission and combat systems. Indeed, the newest U.S. Navy destroyers (for instance the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|4}} and {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|4}}) are more heavily armed than some of the cruisers that they succeeded.\n\nCurrently only two nations operate cruisers: the [[United States Navy|United States]] and [[Russian Navy|Russia]]. ({{ship|BAP|Almirante Grau|CLM-81|6}} was still in service with the Peruvian Navy until 2017, and was the last gun cruiser in service in any navy.)\n\n==Early history==\nThe term \"cruiser\" or \"cruizer\"<ref>The alternative spelling could be found at least as late as 1900: [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] wrote \"We a require an increase.... in all classes of cruizer\" in a letter dated 20th Feb 1900. Mackay, R. ''Fisher of Kilverstone'', p. 242.</ref> was first commonly used in the 17th century to refer to an independent warship. \"Cruiser\" meant the purpose or mission of a ship, rather than a category of vessel. However, the term was nonetheless used to mean a smaller, faster warship suitable for such a role. In the 17th century, the [[ship of the line]] was generally too large, inflexible, and expensive to be dispatched on long-range missions (for instance, to the Americas), and too strategically important to be put at risk of fouling and foundering by continual patrol duties.\n\nThe [[Dutch navy]] was noted for its cruisers in the 17th century, while the [[Royal Navy]]\u2014and later French and Spanish navies\u2014subsequently caught up in terms of their numbers and deployment. The British [[Cruiser and Convoy Act]]s were an attempt by mercantile interests in Parliament to focus the Navy on commerce defence and raiding with cruisers, rather than the more scarce and expensive ships of the line.<ref>[[Rodger, N. A. M.]]: ''The Command of the Ocean, A Naval History of Britain 1649\u20131815''. Allen Lane, London, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7139-9411-8}}</ref> During the 18th century the frigate became the preeminent type of cruiser. A frigate was a small, fast, long range, lightly armed (single gun-deck) ship used for scouting, carrying dispatches, and disrupting enemy trade. The other principal type of cruiser was the sloop, but many other miscellaneous types of ship were used as well.\n\n==Steam cruisers==\nDuring the 19th century, navies began to use steam power for their fleets. The 1840s saw the construction of experimental steam-powered frigates and sloops. By the middle of the 1850s, the British and U.S. Navies were both building steam frigates with very long hulls and a heavy gun armament, for instance {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}} or {{HMS|Mersey|1858|2}}.<ref>Parkes, p.8</ref>\n\nThe 1860s saw the introduction of the [[ironclad]]. The first ironclads were frigates, in the sense of having one gun deck; however, they were also clearly the most powerful ships in the navy, and were principally to serve in the line of battle. In spite of their great speed, they would have been wasted in a cruising role.<ref>Parkes, p.17</ref>\n\nThe French constructed a number of smaller ironclads for overseas cruising duties, starting with the {{ship|French ironclad|Belliqueuse||2}}, commissioned 1865. These \"station ironclads\" were the beginning of the development of the armored cruisers, a type of ironclad specifically for the traditional cruiser missions of fast, independent raiding and patrol.\n[[File:HMS Shannon (1875).jpg|thumb|right| {{HMS|Shannon|1875|6}}, the Royal Navy's first armored cruiser.]]\nThe first true armored cruiser was the Russian {{ship|Russian cruiser|General-Admiral||2}}, completed in 1874, and followed by the British {{HMS|Shannon|1875|2}} a few years later.\n\nUntil the 1890s armored cruisers were still built with masts for a full sailing rig, to enable them to operate far from friendly coaling stations.<ref>Hill, Richard: ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age''. Cassell, London, 2000. {{ISBN|0-304-35273-X}}.</ref>\n\nUnarmored cruising warships, built out of wood, iron, steel or a combination of those materials, remained popular until towards the end of the 19th century. The ironclad's armor often meant that they were limited to short range under steam, and many ironclads were unsuited to long-range missions or for work in distant colonies. The unarmored cruiser - often a [[screw sloop]] or [[screw frigate]] - could continue in this role. Even though mid- to late-19th century cruisers typically carried up-to-date guns firing explosive shells, they were unable to face ironclads in combat. This was evidenced by the clash between {{HMS|Shah|1873|6}}, a modern British cruiser, and the Peruvian [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] [[Hu\u00e1scar (ironclad)|''Hu\u00e1scar'']]. Even though the Peruvian vessel was obsolete by the time of the encounter, it stood up well to roughly 50 hits from British shells.\n\n==Steel cruisers==\n{{main|Protected cruiser}}\n[[File:Croiseur Aurore.png|thumb|The Russian protected cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Aurora||2}}]]\n\nIn the 1880s, naval engineers began to use [[steel]] as a material for construction and armament. A steel cruiser could be lighter and faster than one built of iron or wood. The ''[[Jeune Ecole]]'' school of naval doctrine suggested that a fleet of fast unprotected steel cruisers were ideal for [[commerce raiding]], while the [[torpedo boat]] would be able to destroy an enemy battleship fleet.\n\nSteel also offered the cruiser a way of acquiring the protection needed to survive in combat. Steel armor was considerably stronger, for the same weight, than iron. By putting a relatively thin layer of steel armor above the vital parts of the ship, and by placing the coal bunkers where they might stop shellfire, a useful degree of protection could be achieved without slowing the ship too much. Protected cruisers generally had an armored deck with sloped sides, providing similar protection to a light armored belt at less weight and expense.\n\nThe first protected cruiser was the Chilean ship [[Chilean cruiser Esmeralda (1883)|''Esmeralda'']], launched in 1883. Produced by a shipyard at [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], in Britain, owned by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]], she inspired a group of protected cruisers produced in the same yard and known as the \"Elswick cruisers\". Her [[forecastle]], [[poop deck]] and the wooden board deck had been removed, replaced with an armored deck.\n\n''Esmeralda''{{'}}s armament consisted of fore and aft 10-inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) guns and 6-inch (15.2&nbsp;cm) guns in the midships positions. It could reach a speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h|0}}, and was propelled by steam alone. It also had a displacement of less than 3,000 tons. During the two following decades, this cruiser type came to be the inspiration for combining heavy artillery, high speed and low displacement.\n\n===Torpedo cruisers===\n{{main|Torpedo cruiser}}\nThe torpedo cruiser (known in the Royal Navy as the [[torpedo gunboat]]) was a smaller unarmored cruiser, which emerged in the 1880s-1890s. These ships could reach speeds up to {{convert|20|kn|km/h|0}} and were armed with medium to small calibre guns as well as torpedoes. These ships were tasked with guard and reconnaissance duties, to repeat signals and all other fleet duties for which smaller vessels were suited. These ships could also function as flagships of torpedo boat flotillas. After the 1900s, these ships were usually traded for faster ships with better sea going qualities.\n\n===Pre-dreadnought armored cruisers===\n{{main|Armored cruiser}}\nSteel also affected the construction and role of armored cruisers. Steel meant that new designs of battleship, later known as [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, would be able to combine firepower and armor with better endurance and speed than ever before. The armored cruisers of the 1890s greatly resembled the battleships of the day; they tended to carry slightly smaller main armament ({{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on}} rather than 12-inch) and have somewhat thinner armor in exchange for a faster speed (perhaps {{convert|21|kn|km/h}} rather than 18). Because of their similarity, the lines between battleships and armored cruisers became blurred.\n\n==Early 20th century==\n{{see also|Scout cruiser}}\nShortly after the turn of the 20th century there were difficult questions about the design of future cruisers. Modern armored cruisers, almost as powerful as battleships, were also fast enough to outrun older protected and unarmored cruisers. In the Royal Navy, Jackie Fisher cut back hugely on older vessels, including many cruisers of different sorts, calling them \"a miser's hoard of useless junk\" that any modern cruiser would sweep from the seas. The [[scout cruiser]] also appeared in this era; this was a small, fast, lightly armed and armored type designed primarily for reconnaissance. The Royal Navy and the [[Italian Navy]] were the primary developers of this type.\n\n===Battle cruisers===\n{{main|Battlecruiser}}\n[[Image:LionSP 001672.jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''Lion'' (1910)]]\n\nThe growing size and power of the armored cruiser resulted in the battlecruiser, with an armament and size similar to the revolutionary new dreadnought battleship; the brainchild of British admiral Jackie Fisher. He believed that to ensure British naval dominance in its overseas colonial possessions, a fleet of large, fast, powerfully armed vessels which would be able to hunt down and mop up enemy cruisers and armored cruisers with overwhelming fire superiority was needed. They were equipped with the same gun types as battleships, though usually with fewer guns, and were intended to engage enemy capital ships as well. This type of vessel came to be known as the ''battlecruiser'', and the first were commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1907. The British battlecruisers sacrificed protection for speed, as they were intended to \"choose their range\" (to the enemy) with superior speed and only engage the enemy at long range. When engaged at moderate ranges, the lack of protection combined with unsafe ammunition handling practices became tragic with the loss of three of them at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Germany and eventually Japan followed suit to build these vessels, replacing armored cruisers in most frontline roles. German battlecruisers were generally better protected but slower than British battlecruisers. Battlecruisers were in many cases larger and more expensive than contemporary battleships, due to their much-larger propulsion plants.\n\n===Light cruisers===\n[[File:HMS Caroline 1914.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}}, a World War I era light cruiser, served as a headquarters and training vessel in [[Belfast]] until 2011.]]\n{{main|Light cruiser}}\n\nAt around the same time as the battlecruiser was developed, the distinction between the armored and the unarmored cruiser finally disappeared. By the British {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser (1910)|4}}, the first of which was launched in 1909, it was possible for a small, fast cruiser to carry both belt and deck armor, particularly when turbine engines were adopted. These light armored cruisers began to occupy the traditional cruiser role once it became clear that the battlecruiser squadrons were required to operate with the battle fleet.\n\n===Flotilla leaders===\n{{main|Flotilla leader}}\nSome light cruisers were built specifically to act as the leaders of flotillas of destroyers.\n\n===Coastguard cruisers===\n[[File:Romanian gunboat Grivi\u021ba at Nicopol, 1913.jpg|thumb|Romanian coastguard cruiser ''Grivi\u021ba'']]\nThese vessels were essentially large coastal patrol boats armed with multiple light guns. One such warship was ''[[NMS Grivi\u021ba|Grivi\u021ba]]'' of the [[Romanian Navy]]. She displaced 110 tons, measured 60 meters in length and was armed with four light guns.<ref>John Evelyn Moore, ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I'', Military Press, 1990, p. 295</ref> \n\n===Auxiliary cruisers===\n{{main|Auxiliary cruiser}}\n\nThe [[Armed merchantmen|auxiliary cruiser]] was a [[merchant marine|merchant ship]] hastily armed with small guns on the outbreak of war. Auxiliary cruisers were used to fill gaps in their long-range lines or provide escort for other cargo ships, although they generally proved to be useless in this role because of their low speed, feeble firepower and lack of armor. In both world wars the Germans also used small merchant ships armed with cruiser guns to surprise Allied merchant ships.\n\nSome large liners were armed in the same way. In British service these were known as Armed Merchant Cruisers (AMC). The Germans and French used them in World War I as raiders because of their high speed (around 30&nbsp;knots (56&nbsp;km/h)), and they were used again as raiders early in World War II by the Germans and Japanese. In both the First World War and in the early part of the Second, they were used as convoy escorts by the British.\n\n===World War I===\nCruisers were one of the workhorse types of [[Naval warfare of World War I|warship during World War I]].\n\n==Mid-20th century==\n[[File:Armando Diaz AllenGren3.jpg|thumb|right|Italian cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Armando Diaz||2}}.]]\n\nNaval construction in the 1920s and 1930s was limited by international treaties designed to prevent the repetition of the [[Dreadnought]] arms race of the early 20th century. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed limits on the construction of ships with a [[standard displacement]] of more than 10,000 [[ton]]s and an armament of guns larger than 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm). A number of navies commissioned classes of cruisers at the top end of this limit, known as \"[[treaty cruiser]]s\".<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 2, 167</ref>\n\nThe [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930 then formalised the distinction between these \"heavy\" cruisers and light cruisers: a \"heavy\" cruiser was one with guns of more than 6.1-inch (155&nbsp;mm) calibre.<ref>Friedman cruisers, p. 164</ref> The [[Second London Naval Treaty]] attempted to reduce the tonnage of new cruisers to 8,000 or less, but this had little effect; Japan and Germany were not signatories, and some navies had already begun to evade treaty limitations on warships. The first London treaty did touch off a period of the major powers building 6-inch or 6.1-inch gunned cruisers, nominally of 10,000 tons and with up to fifteen guns, the treaty limit. Thus, most light cruisers ordered after 1930 were the size of heavy cruisers but with more and smaller guns. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] began this new race with the {{sclass-|Mogami|cruiser|4}}, launched in 1934.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 190</ref> After building smaller light cruisers with six or eight 6-inch guns launched 1931-35, the British Royal Navy followed with the 12-gun {{sclass-|Southampton|cruiser|4}} in 1936.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 30\u201331</ref> To match foreign developments and potential treaty violations, in the 1930s the US developed a series of new guns firing \"super-heavy\" armor piercing ammunition; these included the [[6\"/47 caliber gun|6-inch (152&nbsp;mm)/47 caliber gun Mark 16]] introduced with the 15-gun {{sclass-|Brooklyn|cruiser|1}}s in 1936,<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-55_mk12-15.htm DiGiulian, Tony, 8\"/55 (20.3 cm) Marks 12 and 15 at NavWeaps.com]</ref> and the [[8\"/55 caliber gun|8-inch (203&nbsp;mm)/55 caliber gun Mark 12]] introduced with {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|6}} in 1937.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_6-47_mk16.htm DiGiulian, Tony, 6\"/47 (15.2 cm) Mark 16 at NavWeaps.com]</ref><ref>Friedman cruisers, pp. 217\u2013220</ref>\n\n===Heavy cruisers===\n{{see also|Heavy cruiser}}\n\nThe heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser designed for long range, high speed and an armament of naval guns around 203&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in) in calibre. The first heavy cruisers were built in 1915, although it only became a widespread classification following the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The heavy cruiser's immediate precursors were the light cruiser designs of the 1910s and 1920s; the US lightly armored 8-inch \"treaty cruisers\" of the 1920s (built under the Washington Naval Treaty) were originally classed as light cruisers until the London Treaty forced their redesignation.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 136\u2013138</ref>\n\nInitially, all cruisers built under the Washington treaty had torpedo tubes, regardless of nationality. However, in 1930, results of war games caused the US [[Naval War College]] to conclude that only perhaps half of cruisers would use their torpedoes in action. In a surface engagement, long-range gunfire and destroyer torpedoes would decide the issue, and under air attack numerous cruisers would be lost before getting within torpedo range. Thus, beginning with {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|6}} launched in 1933, new cruisers were built without torpedoes, and torpedoes were removed from older heavy cruisers due to the perceived hazard of their being exploded by shell fire.<ref>Friedman cruisers, p. 150</ref> The Japanese took exactly the opposite approach with cruiser torpedoes, and this proved crucial to their tactical victories in most of the numerous cruiser actions of 1942. Beginning with the {{sclass-|Furutaka|cruiser|4}} launched in 1925, every Japanese heavy cruiser was armed with {{convert|24|in|adj=on}} torpedoes, larger than any other cruisers'.<ref name=Watts1>Watts, pp. 79\u2013114</ref> By 1933 Japan had developed the [[Type 93 torpedo]] for these ships, eventually nicknamed \"Long Lance\" by the Allies. This type used compressed oxygen instead of compressed air, allowing it to achieve ranges and speeds unmatched by other torpedoes. It could achieve a range of {{convert|22,000|m|yd}} at {{convert|50|kn}}, compared with the US [[Mark 15 torpedo]] with {{convert|5,500|m|yd}} at {{convert|45|kn}}. The Mark 15 had a maximum range of {{convert|13,500|m|yd}} at {{convert|26.5|kn}}, still well below the \"Long Lance\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Torpedo History: Torpedo Mk15 | url= http://www.history.navy.mil/museums/keyport/html/part2.htm | access-date = 25 May 2016}}</ref> The Japanese were able to keep the Type 93's performance and oxygen power secret until the Allies recovered one in early 1943, thus the Allies faced a great threat they were not aware of in 1942. The Type 93 was also fitted to Japanese post-1930 light cruisers and the majority of their World War II destroyers.<ref name=Watts1/><ref name=Watts2>Watts, pp. 124\u2013158</ref>\n\nHeavy cruisers continued in use until after World War II, with some converted to guided missile cruisers for air defense or [[SSM-N-8 Regulus#Ships fitted with Regulus|strategic attack]] and some used for shore bombardment by the United States in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n===German pocket battleships===\nThe German {{sclass-|Deutschland|cruiser|4}} was a series of three ''Panzerschiffe'' (\"armored ships\"), a form of heavily armed cruiser, designed and built by the [[Reichsmarine|German Reichsmarine]] in nominal accordance with restrictions imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. All three ships were launched between 1931 and 1934, and served with Germany's [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]]. Within the Kriegsmarine, the Panzerschiffe had the propaganda value of capital ships: heavy cruisers with battleship guns, torpedoes, and scout aircraft. The similar Swedish ''Panzerschiffe'' were tactically used as centers of battlefleets and not as cruisers. They were deployed by Nazi Germany in support of the German interests in the Spanish Civil War. Panzerschiff ''Admiral Graf Spee'' represented Germany in the [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)#George VI|1937 Cornation Fleet Review]].\n\nThe British press referred to the vessels as pocket battleships, in reference to the heavy firepower contained in the relatively small vessels; they were considerably smaller than contemporary battleships, though at 28 knots were slower than battlecruisers. At up to 16,000 tons at full load, they were not treaty compliant 10,000 ton cruisers. And although their displacement and scale of armor protection were that of a heavy cruiser, their {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on}} main armament was heavier than the {{convert|203|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns of other nations' heavy cruisers, and the latter two members of the class also had tall conning towers resembling battleships. The Panzerschiffe were listed as Ersatz replacements for retiring Reichsmarine coastal defense battleships, which added to their propaganda status in the Kriegsmarine as Ersatz battleships; within the Royal Navy, only battlecruisers HMS ''Hood'', ''Repulse'' and  ''Renown'' were capable of both outrunning and outgunning the Panzerschiffe. They were seen in the 1930s as a new and serious threat by both Britain and France. While the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in 1940, ''Deutschland''-class ships continued to be called ''pocket battleships'' in the popular press.\n\n===Large cruiser===\nThe American {{sclass-|Alaska|cruiser|4}} represented the supersized cruiser design. Due to the German [[Deutschland-class cruiser|pocket battleships]], the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|4}}, and rumored Japanese \"super cruisers\", all of which carried guns larger than the standard heavy cruiser's 8-inch size dictated by naval treaty limitations, the ''Alaska''s were intended to be \"cruiser-killers\". While superficially appearing similar to a battleship/battlecruiser and mounting three triple turrets of [[12\"/50 caliber Mark 8 gun|12-inch guns]], their actual protection scheme and design resembled a scaled-up heavy cruiser design. Their hull classification symbol of CB (cruiser, big) reflected this.<ref>Friedman cruisers, pp. 286\u2013305</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft cruisers===\n[[File:USS Atlanta (CL-51).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|6}}.]]\n\nA precursor to the anti-aircraft cruiser was the Romanian British-built protected cruiser ''[[NMS Elisabeta|Elisabeta]]''. After the start of World War I, her four 120 mm main guns were landed and her four 75 mm (12-pounder) secondary guns were modified for anti-aircraft fire.<ref>John Evelyn Moore, ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I'', Military Press, 1990, p. 294</ref>\n\nThe development of the anti-aircraft cruiser began in 1935 when the Royal Navy re-armed {{HMS|Coventry|D43|6}} and {{HMS|Curlew|D42|6}}. Torpedo tubes and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} low-angle guns were removed from these World War I light cruisers and replaced with ten {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0}} high-angle guns, with appropriate fire-control equipment to provide larger warships with protection against high-altitude bombers.<ref>Friedman, Norman \"Anti-Aircraft Cruisers: The Life of a Class\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1965 p. 86</ref>\n\nA tactical shortcoming was recognised after completing six additional conversions of {{sclass2-|C|cruiser|1}}s. Having sacrificed anti-ship weapons for anti-aircraft armament, the converted anti-aircraft cruisers might themselves need protection against surface units. New construction was undertaken to create cruisers of similar speed and displacement with [[dual-purpose gun]]s, which offered good anti-aircraft protection with anti-surface capability for the traditional light cruiser role of defending capital ships from destroyers.\n\nThe first purpose built anti-aircraft cruiser was the British {{sclass-|Dido|cruiser|4}}, completed in 1940\u201342. The US Navy's {{sclass-|Atlanta|cruiser|0}} cruisers (CLAA: light cruiser with anti-aircraft capability) were designed to match the capabilities of the Royal Navy. Both ''Dido'' and ''Atlanta'' cruisers initially carried torpedo tubes; the ''Atlanta'' cruisers at least were originally designed as destroyer leaders, were originally designated CL ([[light cruiser]]), and did not receive the CLAA designation until 1949.<ref>Friedman cruisers, pp. 224\u2013229</ref><ref>Bauer and Roberts, p. 150</ref>\n\nThe concept of the quick-firing dual-purpose gun anti-aircraft cruiser was embraced in several designs completed too late to see combat, including: {{USS|Worcester|CL-144|6}}, completed in 1948; {{USS|Roanoke|CL-145|6}}, completed in 1949; two {{sclass-|Tre Kronor|cruiser|2}}s, completed in 1947; two {{sclass-|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn|cruiser|2}}s, completed in 1953; {{ship|French cruiser|De Grasse|C610|2}}, completed in 1955; {{ship|French cruiser|Colbert|C611|2}}, completed in 1959; and {{HMS|Tiger|C20|6}}, {{HMS|Lion|C34|6}} and {{HMS|Blake|C99|6}}, all completed between 1959 and 1961.<ref>Friedman, Norman \"Anti-Aircraft Cruisers: The Life of a Class\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1965 pp.96\u201397</ref>\n\nMost post-World War II cruisers were tasked with air defense roles. In the early 1950s, advances in aviation technology forced the move from anti-aircraft artillery to anti-aircraft missiles. Therefore, most modern cruisers are equipped with surface-to-air missiles as their main armament. Today's equivalent of the anti-aircraft cruiser is the '''guided missile cruiser''' (CAG/CLG/CG/CGN).\n\n==World War II==\nCruisers participated in a number of surface engagements in the early part of World War II, along with escorting carrier and battleship groups throughout the war. In the later part of the war, Allied cruisers primarily provided anti-aircraft (AA) escort for carrier groups and performed shore bombardment. Japanese cruisers similarly escorted carrier and battleship groups in the later part of the war, notably in the disastrous [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. In 1937-41 the Japanese, having withdrawn from all naval treaties, upgraded or completed the ''Mogami'' and {{sclass-|Tone|cruiser|4}}es as heavy cruisers by replacing their {{convert|6.1|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} triple turrets with {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} twin turrets.<ref>Watts, pp. 99\u2013105</ref> Torpedo refits were also made to most heavy cruisers, resulting in up to sixteen {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} tubes per ship, plus a set of reloads.<ref>Watts, pp. 79\u2013105</ref> In 1941 the 1920s light cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|\u014ci||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kitakami||2}} were converted to [[torpedo cruiser]]s with four {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns and forty {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} torpedo tubes. In 1944 ''Kitakami'' was further converted to carry up to eight ''[[Kaiten]]'' [[human torpedo]]es in place of ordinary torpedoes.<ref>Watts, pp. 70\u201373</ref>\n\n===1939 to Pearl Harbor===\nIn December 1939, three British cruisers engaged the [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|German \"pocket battleship\" ''Admiral Graf Spee'']] (which was on a commerce raiding mission) in the [[Battle of the River Plate]]; ''Admiral Graf Spee'' then took refuge in neutral [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. By broadcasting messages indicating capital ships were in the area, the British caused ''Admiral Graf Spee''{{'}}s captain to think he faced a hopeless situation while low on ammunition and order his ship scuttled.<ref>Churchill 1948, pp. 525\u2013526</ref> On 8 June 1940 the German capital ships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, classed as battleships but with large cruiser armament, sank the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}} with gunfire.<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> From October 1940 through March 1941 the German heavy cruiser (also known as \"pocket battleship\", see above) {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} conducted a successful commerce-raiding voyage in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 48\u201365</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1941, {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} attempted to finish off the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} with torpedoes, probably causing the Germans to scuttle the ship.<ref>Kennedy, p. 204</ref> ''Bismarck'' (accompanied by the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}) previously sank the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood}} and damaged the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} with gunfire in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 45</ref>\n\nOn 19 November 1941 {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} sank in a mutually fatal [[battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|engagement with the German raider ''Kormoran'']] in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia.\n\n===Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean operations 1942\u20131944===\nTwenty-three British cruisers were [[List of Royal Navy losses in World War II#Cruisers|lost to enemy action]], mostly to air attack and submarines, in operations in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean. Sixteen of these losses were in the Mediterranean.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/WW2aBritishLosses10tables.htm British losses in WWII at Naval-History.net]</ref> The British included cruisers and anti-aircraft cruisers among convoy escorts in the Mediterranean and to northern Russia due to the threat of surface and air attack. Almost all cruisers in World War II were vulnerable to submarine attack due to a lack of anti-submarine [[sonar]] and weapons. Also, until 1943-44 the light anti-aircraft armament of most cruisers was weak.\n\nIn July 1942 an attempt to intercept [[Convoy PQ-17]] with surface ships, including the heavy cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'', failed due to multiple German warships grounding, but air and submarine attacks sank 2/3 of the convoy's ships.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 175\u2013176</ref> In August 1942 ''Admiral Scheer'' conducted [[Operation Wunderland]], a solo raid into northern Russia's [[Kara Sea]].

Four British destroyers and five other vessels were escorting [[Convoy JW 51B]] from the UK to the Murmansk area. Another British force of two cruisers ({{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}} and {{HMS|Jamaica|44|6}}) and two destroyers were in the area. Two heavy cruisers (one the \"pocket battleship\" ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|L\u00fctzow]]''), accompanied by six destroyers, attempted to intercept the convoy near [[North Cape (Norway)|North Cape]] after it was spotted by a U-boat. Although the Germans sank a British destroyer and a minesweeper (also damaging another destroyer), they failed to damage any of the convoy's merchant ships. A German destroyer was lost and a heavy cruiser damaged. Both sides withdrew from the action for fear of the other side's torpedoes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kappes |first=Irwin J. |date=23 February 2010|title=Battle of the Barents Sea |publisher=German-Navy.De |url=http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/articles/feature5.html |access-date=29 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607120149/http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/articles/feature5.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=7 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 1943 the German capital ship ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk while attempting to intercept a convoy in the [[Battle of the North Cape]].

One 28&nbsp;cm triple turret survives near [[Trondheim]], Norway.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 148\u2013150</ref>\n\n===Pearl Harbor through Dutch East Indies campaign===\nThe [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941 brought the United States into the war, but with eight battleships sunk or damaged by air attack.<ref>Morison vol III, p. 158</ref> On 10 December 1941 HMS ''Prince of Wales'' and the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} were [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sunk by land-based torpedo bombers]] northeast of Singapore. It was now clear that surface ships could not operate near enemy aircraft in daylight without air cover; most surface actions of 1942-43 were fought at night as a result. Generally, both sides avoided risking their battleships until the Japanese attack at Leyte Gulf in 1944.<ref>Morison vol III, pp. 188\u2013190</ref><ref>Morison vol XII</ref>\n\nSix of the battleships from Pearl Harbor were eventually returned to service, but no US battleships engaged Japanese surface units at sea until the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] in November 1942, and not thereafter until the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944.<ref name=FriedBat1>Friedman battleships, pp. 345\u2013347</ref> {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|6}} was on hand for the initial landings at Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942, and escorted carriers in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] later that month. However, on 15 September she was torpedoed while escorting a carrier group and had to return to the US for repairs.<ref name=FriedBat1/>\n\nGenerally, the Japanese held their capital ships out of all surface actions in the 1941-42 campaigns or they failed to close with the enemy; the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942 was the sole exception. The four {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|0}} ships performed shore bombardment in Malaya, Singapore, and Guadalcanal and escorted the [[Indian Ocean raid|raid on Ceylon]] and other carrier forces in 1941-42. Japanese capital ships also participated ineffectively (due to not being engaged) in the [[Battle of Midway]] and the simultaneous [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutian diversion]]; in both cases they were in battleship groups well to the rear of the carrier groups. Sources state that {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} sat out the entire [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] due to lack of high-explosive bombardment shells, poor nautical charts of the area, and high fuel consumption.<ref name=G&D54>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 54</ref><ref name=\"jackson128\">Jackson (2000), p. 128</ref> It is likely that the poor charts affected other battleships as well. Except for the ''Kong\u014d'' class, most Japanese battleships spent the critical year of 1942, in which most of the war's surface actions occurred, in home waters or at the fortified base of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], far from any risk of attacking or being attacked.\n\nFrom 1942 through mid-1943, US and other Allied cruisers were the heavy units on their side of the numerous surface engagements of the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]], the Guadalcanal Campaign, and subsequent [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomon Islands]] fighting; they were usually opposed by strong Japanese cruiser-led forces equipped with [[Long Lance]] torpedoes. Destroyers also participated heavily on both sides of these battles and provided essentially all the torpedoes on the Allied side, with some battles in these campaigns fought entirely between destroyers.\n\nAlong with lack of knowledge of the capabilities of the Long Lance torpedo, the US Navy was hampered by a deficiency it was initially unaware of \u2013 the unreliability of the Mark 15 torpedo used by destroyers. This weapon shared the [[Mark 6 exploder]] and other problems with the more famously unreliable [[Mark 14 torpedo]]; the most common results of firing either of these torpedoes were a dud or a miss. The problems with these weapons were not solved until mid-1943, after almost all of the surface actions in the Solomon Islands had taken place.<ref name=BuOrd1>Rowland and Boyd, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Another factor that shaped the early surface actions was the pre-war training of both sides. The US Navy concentrated on long-range 8-inch gunfire as their primary offensive weapon, leading to rigid [[battle line]] tactics, while the Japanese trained extensively for nighttime torpedo attacks.<ref name=FriedCru1>Friedman cruisers, pp. 312\u2013315</ref><ref name=FriedDes1>Friedman destroyers, pp. 168\u2013172</ref> Since all post-1930 Japanese cruisers had 8-inch guns by 1941, almost all of the US Navy's cruisers in the South Pacific in 1942 were the 8-inch-gunned (203&nbsp;mm) \"treaty cruisers\"; most of the 6-inch-gunned (152&nbsp;mm) cruisers were deployed in the Atlantic.<ref name=FriedCru1/>\n\n===Dutch East Indies campaign===\nAlthough their battleships were held out of surface action, Japanese cruiser-destroyer forces rapidly isolated and mopped up the Allied naval forces in the Dutch East Indies campaign of February\u2013March 1942. In three separate actions, they sank five Allied cruisers (two Dutch and one each British, Australian, and American) with torpedoes and gunfire, against one Japanese cruiser damaged.<ref>The British cruiser was {{HMS|Exeter|68|2}}, which previously engaged ''Graf Spee''.</ref> With one other Allied cruiser withdrawn for repairs, the only remaining Allied cruiser in the area was the damaged {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|6}}. Despite their rapid success, the Japanese proceeded methodically, never leaving their air cover and rapidly establishing new air bases as they advanced.<ref>Morison vol. III, pp. 292\u2013293</ref>\n\n===Guadalcanal campaign===\nAfter the key carrier battles of the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and Midway in mid-1942, Japan had lost four of the six fleet carriers that launched the Pearl Harbor raid and was on the strategic defensive. On 7 August 1942 [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] were landed on Guadalcanal and other nearby islands, beginning the Guadalcanal Campaign. This campaign proved to be a severe test for the Navy as well as the Marines. Along with two carrier battles, several major surface actions occurred, almost all at night between cruiser-destroyer forces.\n\n'''Battle of Savo Island'''<br>\nOn the night of 8\u20139 August 1942 the Japanese counterattacked near Guadalcanal in the [[Battle of Savo Island]] with a cruiser-destroyer force. In a controversial move, the US carrier task forces were withdrawn from the area on the 8th due to heavy fighter losses and low fuel. The Allied force included six heavy cruisers (two Australian), two light cruisers (one Australian), and eight US destroyers.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Savo/Quantock/#page4 Quantock, David E., Lt. Col., USA, ''Disaster at Savo Island, 1942'']</ref> Of the cruisers, only the Australian ships had torpedoes. The Japanese force included five heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and one destroyer. Numerous circumstances combined to reduce Allied readiness for the battle. The results of the battle were three American heavy cruisers sunk by torpedoes and gunfire, one Australian heavy cruiser disabled by gunfire and scuttled, one heavy cruiser damaged, and two US destroyers damaged. The Japanese had three cruisers lightly damaged. This was the most lopsided outcome of the surface actions in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Along with their superior torpedoes, the opening Japanese gunfire was accurate and very damaging. Subsequent analysis showed that some of the damage was due to poor housekeeping practices by US forces. Stowage of boats and aircraft in midships hangars with full gas tanks contributed to fires, along with full and unprotected ready-service ammunition lockers for the open-mount secondary armament. These practices were soon corrected, and US cruisers with similar damage sank less often thereafter.<ref name=FriedDmg1>Friedman cruisers, pp. 316\u2013321</ref> It should be noted that Savo was the first surface action of the war for almost all the US ships and personnel; few US cruisers and destroyers were targeted or hit at Coral Sea or Midway.\n\n'''Battle of the Eastern Solomons'''<br>\nOn 24\u201325 August 1942 the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, a major carrier action, was fought. Part of the action was a Japanese attempt to reinforce Guadalcanal with men and equipment on [[troop transport]]s. The Japanese troop convoy was attacked by Allied aircraft, resulting in the Japanese subsequently reinforcing Guadalcanal with troops on fast warships at night. These convoys were called the \"[[Tokyo Express]]\" by the Allies. Although the Tokyo Express often ran unopposed, most surface actions in the Solomons revolved around Tokyo Express missions. Also, US air operations had commenced from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]], the airfield on Guadalcanal. Fear of air power on both sides resulted in all surface actions in the Solomons being fought at night.\n\n'''Battle of Cape Esperance'''<br>\nThe [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] occurred on the night of 11\u201312 October 1942. A Tokyo Express mission was underway for Guadalcanal at the same time as a separate cruiser-destroyer bombardment group loaded with high explosive shells for bombarding Henderson Field. A US cruiser-destroyer force was deployed in advance of a convoy of US Army troops for Guadalcanal that was due on 13 October. The Tokyo Express convoy was two seaplane tenders and six destroyers; the bombardment group was three heavy cruisers and two destroyers, and the US force was two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and five destroyers. The US force engaged the Japanese bombardment force; the Tokyo Express convoy was able to unload on Guadalcanal and evade action. The bombardment force was sighted at close range ({{convert|5000|yd|m}}) and the US force opened fire. The Japanese were surprised because their admiral was anticipating sighting the Tokyo Express force, and withheld fire while attempting to confirm the US ships' identity.<ref>Morison vol. V, pp. 156\u2013160</ref> One Japanese cruiser and one destroyer were sunk and one cruiser damaged, against one US destroyer sunk with one light cruiser and one destroyer damaged. The bombardment force failed to bring its torpedoes into action, and turned back. The next day US aircraft from Henderson Field attacked several of the Japanese ships, sinking two destroyers and damaging a third.<ref>Morison vol. V, p. 169</ref> The US victory resulted in overconfidence in some later battles, reflected in the initial after-action report claiming two Japanese heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and three destroyers sunk by the gunfire of {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} alone.<ref name=FriedDmg1/> The battle had little effect on the overall situation, as the next night two Kong\u014d-class battleships bombarded and severely damaged Henderson Field unopposed, and the following night another Tokyo Express convoy delivered 4,500 troops to Guadalcanal. The US convoy delivered the Army troops as scheduled on the 13th.<ref>Morison vol. V, p. 171</ref>\n\n'''Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands'''<br>\nThe [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] took place 25\u201327 October 1942. It was a pivotal battle, as it left the US and Japanese with only two large carriers each in the South Pacific (another large Japanese carrier was damaged and under repair until May 1943). Due to the high carrier attrition rate with no replacements for months, for the most part both sides stopped risking their remaining carriers until late 1943, and each side sent in a pair of battleships instead. The next major carrier operations for the US were the [[carrier raid on Rabaul]] and support for the [[Battle of Tarawa|invasion of Tarawa]], both in November 1943.\n\n'''Naval Battle of Guadalcanal'''<br>\nThe Naval Battle of Guadalcanal occurred 12\u201315 November 1942 in two phases. A night surface action on 12\u201313 November was the first phase. The Japanese force consisted of two Kong\u014d-class battleships with high explosive shells for bombarding Henderson Field, one small light cruiser, and 11 destroyers. Their plan was that the bombardment would neutralize Allied airpower and allow a force of 11 transport ships and 12 destroyers to reinforce Guadalcanal with a Japanese division the next day.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1>Morrison vol. V, pp. 254\u2013274</ref> However, US reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approaching Japanese on the 12th and the Americans made what preparations they could. The American force consisted of two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, two anti-aircraft cruisers,<ref>Although these ships were designated light cruisers at the time, the term \"anti-aircraft\" is used to distinguish them from larger London Treaty light cruisers.</ref> and eight destroyers. The Americans were outgunned by the Japanese that night, and a lack of pre-battle orders by the US commander led to confusion. The destroyer {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|6}} closed with the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}, firing all torpedoes (though apparently none hit or detonated) and raking the battleship's bridge with gunfire, wounding the Japanese admiral and killing his chief of staff. The Americans initially lost four destroyers including ''Laffey'', with both heavy cruisers, most of the remaining destroyers, and both anti-aircraft cruisers damaged. The Japanese initially had one battleship and four destroyers damaged, but at this point they withdrew, possibly unaware that the US force was unable to further oppose them.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/> At dawn US aircraft from Henderson Field, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, and [[Espiritu Santo]] found the damaged battleship and two destroyers in the area. The battleship (''Hiei'') was sunk by aircraft (or possibly scuttled), one destroyer was sunk by the damaged {{USS|Portland|CA-33|6}}, and the other destroyer was attacked by aircraft but was able to withdraw.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/> Both of the damaged US anti-aircraft cruisers were lost on 13 November, one ({{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}) torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, and the other sank on the way to repairs. ''Juneau''{{'}}s loss was especially tragic; the submarine's presence prevented immediate rescue, over 100 survivors of a crew of nearly 700 were adrift for eight days, and all but ten died. Among the dead were the five [[Sullivan brothers]].<ref>Kurzman</ref>\n\nThe Japanese transport force was rescheduled for the 14th and a new cruiser-destroyer force (belatedly joined by the surviving battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}) was sent to bombard Henderson Field the night of 13 November. Only two cruisers actually bombarded the airfield, as ''Kirishima'' had not arrived yet and the remainder of the force was on guard for US warships. The bombardment caused little damage. The cruiser-destroyer force then withdrew, while the transport force continued towards Guadalcanal. Both forces were attacked by US aircraft on the 14th. The cruiser force lost one heavy cruiser sunk and one damaged. Although the transport force had fighter cover from the carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'y\u014d||2}}, six transports were sunk and one heavily damaged. All but four of the destroyers accompanying the transport force picked up survivors and withdrew. The remaining four transports and four destroyers approached Guadalcanal at night, but stopped to await the results of the night's action.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/>\n\nOn the night of 14-15 November a Japanese force of ''Kirishima'', two heavy and two light cruisers, and nine destroyers approached Guadalcanal. Two US battleships ({{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}} and {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}) were there to meet them, along with four destroyers. This was one of only two battleship-on-battleship encounters during the Pacific War; the other was the lopsided Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The battleships had been escorting ''Enterprise'', but were detached due to the urgency of the situation. With nine 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns apiece against eight 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns on ''Kirishima'', the Americans had major gun and armor advantages. All four destroyers were sunk or severely damaged and withdrawn shortly after the Japanese attacked them with gunfire and torpedoes.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/> Although her main battery remained in action for most of the battle, ''South Dakota'' spent much of the action dealing with major electrical failures that affected her radar, [[Fire-control system|fire control]], and radio systems. Although her armor was not penetrated, she was hit by 26 shells of various calibers and temporarily rendered, in a US admiral's words, \"deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent\".<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/><ref name=\"FriedBat1\"/> ''Washington'' went undetected by the Japanese for most of the battle, but withheld shooting to avoid \"friendly fire\" until ''South Dakota'' was illuminated by Japanese fire, then rapidly set ''Kirishima'' ablaze with a jammed rudder and other damage. ''Washington'', finally spotted by the Japanese, then headed for the [[Russell Islands]] to hopefully draw the Japanese away from Guadalcanal and ''South Dakota'', and was successful in evading several torpedo attacks. Unusually, only a few Japanese torpedoes scored hits in this engagement. ''Kirishima'' sank or was scuttled before the night was out, along with two Japanese destroyers. The remaining Japanese ships withdrew, except for the four transports, which beached themselves in the night and started unloading. However, dawn (and US aircraft, US artillery, and a US destroyer) found them still beached, and they were destroyed.<ref name=MorNvlGuad1/>\n\n'''Battle of Tassafaronga'''<br>\nThe [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] took place on the night of 30 November-1 December 1942. The US had four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and four destroyers. The Japanese had eight destroyers on a Tokyo Express run to deliver food and supplies in drums to Guadalcanal. The Americans achieved initial surprise, damaging one destroyer with gunfire which later sank, but the Japanese torpedo counterattack was devastating. One American heavy cruiser was sunk and three others heavily damaged, with the bows blown off of two of them.<ref>Morison vol. V, pp. 299\u2013307</ref> It was significant that these two were not lost to Long Lance hits as happened in previous battles; American battle readiness and damage control had improved.<ref name=FriedDmg1/> Despite defeating the Americans, the Japanese withdrew without delivering the crucial supplies to Guadalcanal. Another attempt on 3 December dropped 1,500 drums of supplies near Guadalcanal, but Allied strafing aircraft sank all but 300 before the Japanese Army could recover them. On 7 December [[PT boat]]s interrupted a Tokyo Express run, and the following night sank a Japanese supply submarine. The next day the Japanese Navy proposed stopping all destroyer runs to Guadalcanal, but agreed to do just one more. This was on 11 December and was also intercepted by PT boats, which sank a destroyer; only 200 of 1,200 drums dropped off the island were recovered.<ref>Morison vol. V, pp. 318\u2013321</ref> The next day the Japanese Navy proposed abandoning Guadalcanal; this was approved by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] on 31 December and the Japanese left the island in early February 1943.<ref>Evans and Tanaka, pp. 208\u2013209</ref>\n\n===Post-Guadalcanal===\nAfter the Japanese abandoned Guadalcanal in February 1943, Allied operations in the Pacific shifted to the [[New Guinea campaign]] and [[Operation Cartwheel|isolating Rabaul]]. The [[Battle of Kula Gulf]] was fought on the night of 5\u20136 July. The US had three light cruisers and four destroyers; the Japanese had ten destroyers loaded with 2,600 troops destined for [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]] to oppose a recent US landing on [[Rendova]]. Although the Japanese sank a cruiser, they lost two destroyers and were able to deliver only 850 troops.<ref name=MorVI-1>Morison, vol. VI</ref> On the night of 12\u201313 July, the [[Battle of Kolombangara]] occurred. The Allies had three light cruisers (one New Zealand) and ten destroyers; the Japanese had one small light cruiser and five destroyers, a Tokyo Express run for Vila. All three Allied cruisers were heavily damaged, with the New Zealand cruiser put out of action for 25 months by a Long Lance hit.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 30</ref> The Allies sank only the Japanese light cruiser, and the Japanese landed 1,200 troops at Vila. Despite their tactical victory, this battle caused the Japanese to use a different route in the future, where they were more vulnerable to destroyer and PT boat attacks.<ref name=MorVI-1/>\n\nThe [[Battle of Empress Augusta Bay]] was fought on the night of 1\u20132 November 1943, immediately after US Marines [[Bougainville Campaign|invaded Bougainville]] in the Solomon Islands. A Japanese heavy cruiser was damaged by a nighttime air attack shortly before the battle; it is likely that Allied airborne radar had progressed far enough to allow night operations. The Americans had four of the new {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|0}} cruisers and eight destroyers. The Japanese had two heavy cruisers, two small light cruisers, and six destroyers. Both sides were plagued by collisions, shells that failed to explode, and mutual skill in dodging torpedoes. The Americans suffered significant damage to three destroyers and light damage to a cruiser, but no losses. The Japanese lost one light cruiser and a destroyer, with four other ships damaged. The Japanese withdrew; the Americans pursued them until dawn, then returned to the landing area to provide anti-aircraft cover.<ref>Morison, vol. VI, p. 322</ref>\n\nAfter the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942, both sides were short of large aircraft carriers. The US suspended major carrier operations until sufficient carriers could be completed to destroy the entire Japanese fleet at once should it appear. The Central Pacific carrier raids and amphibious operations commenced in November 1943 with a carrier raid on Rabaul (preceded and followed by [[Fifth Air Force]] attacks) and the bloody but successful invasion of Tarawa. The air attacks on Rabaul crippled the Japanese cruiser force, with four heavy and two light cruisers damaged; they were withdrawn to Truk. The US had built up a force in the Central Pacific of six large, five [[light aircraft carrier|light]], and six [[escort carrier]]s prior to commencing these operations.\n\nFrom this point on, US cruisers primarily served as anti-aircraft escorts for carriers and in shore bombardment. The only major Japanese carrier operation after Guadalcanal was the disastrous (for Japan) Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, nicknamed the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\" by the US Navy.\n\n===Leyte Gulf===\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy's last major operation was the Battle of Leyte Gulf, an attempt to dislodge the American invasion of the Philippines in October 1944. The two actions at this battle in which cruisers played a significant role were the [[Battle off Samar]] and the Battle of Surigao Strait.\n\n'''Battle of Surigao Strait'''<br>\nThe Battle of Surigao Strait was fought on the night of 24\u201325 October, a few hours before the Battle off Samar. The Japanese had a small battleship group composed of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fus\u014d||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers. They were followed at a considerable distance by another small force of two heavy cruisers, a small light cruiser, and four destroyers. Their goal was to head north through [[Surigao Strait]] and attack the invasion fleet off [[Leyte]]. The Allied force, known as the 7th Fleet Support Force, guarding the strait was overwhelming. It included six battleships (all but one previously damaged in 1941 at Pearl Harbor), four heavy cruisers (one Australian), four light cruisers, and 28 destroyers, plus a force of 39 PT boats. The only advantage to the Japanese was that most of the battleships and cruisers were loaded mainly with high explosive shells, although a significant number of armor-piercing shells were also loaded. The lead Japanese force evaded the PT boats' torpedoes, but were hit hard by the destroyers' torpedoes, losing a battleship. Then they encountered the battleship and cruiser guns. Only one destroyer survived. The engagement is notable for being one of only two occasions in which battleships fired on battleships in the Pacific Theater, the other being the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Due to the starting arrangement of the opposing forces, the Allied force was in a \"[[crossing the T]]\" position, so this was the last battle in which this occurred, but it was not a planned maneuver. The following Japanese cruiser force had several problems, including a light cruiser damaged by a PT boat and two heavy cruisers colliding, one of which fell behind and was sunk by air attack the next day.<ref name=MorXII-1>Morison vol. XII</ref> An American veteran of Surigao Strait, {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|6}}, was transferred to Argentina in 1951 as {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}}, becoming most famous for being sunk by {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} in the [[Falklands War]] on 2 May 1982. She was the first ship sunk by a nuclear submarine outside of accidents, and only the second ship sunk by a submarine since World War II.<ref>Kemp, p. 68</ref>\n\n'''Battle off Samar'''<br>\nAt the Battle off Samar, a Japanese battleship group moving towards the invasion fleet off Leyte engaged a minuscule American force known as \"Taffy 3\" (formally Task Unit 77.4.3), composed of six escort carriers with about 28 aircraft each, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. The biggest guns in the American force were [[5\"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|abbr=on|0}}/38 caliber guns]], while the Japanese had {{convert|14|in|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|0}}, and {{convert|18.1|in|abbr=on|0}} guns. Aircraft from six additional escort carriers also participated for a total of around 330 US aircraft, a mix of [[F6F Hellcat]] fighters and [[TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers. The Japanese had four battleships including ''Yamato'', six heavy cruisers, two small light cruisers, and 11 destroyers. The Japanese force had earlier been driven off by air attack, losing ''Yamato''{{'}}s sister {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}. Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.|Halsey]] then decided to use his Third Fleet carrier force to attack the Japanese carrier group, located well to the north of Samar, which was actually a decoy group with few aircraft. The Japanese were desperately short of aircraft and pilots at this point in the war, and Leyte Gulf was the first battle in which ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks were used. Due to a tragedy of errors, Halsey took the American battleship force with him, leaving [[San Bernardino Strait]] guarded only by the small Seventh Fleet escort carrier force. The battle commenced at dawn on 25 October 1944, shortly after the Battle of Surigao Strait. In the engagement that followed, the Americans exhibited uncanny torpedo accuracy, blowing the bows off several Japanese heavy cruisers. The escort carriers' aircraft also performed very well, attacking with machine guns after their carriers ran out of bombs and torpedoes. The unexpected level of damage, and maneuvering to avoid the torpedoes and air attacks, disorganized the Japanese and caused them to think they faced at least part of the Third Fleet's main force. They had also learned of the defeat a few hours before at Surigao Strait, and did not hear that Halsey's force was busy destroying the decoy fleet. Convinced that the rest of the Third Fleet would arrive soon if it hadn't already, the Japanese withdrew, eventually losing three heavy cruisers sunk with three damaged to air and torpedo attacks. The Americans lost two escort carriers, two destroyers, and one destroyer escort sunk, with three escort carriers, one destroyer, and two destroyer escorts damaged, thus losing over one-third of their engaged force sunk with nearly all the remainder damaged.<ref name=MorXII-1/>\n\n===Wartime cruiser production===\nThe US built cruisers in quantity through the end of the war, notably 14 {{sclass-|Baltimore|cruiser|0}} heavy cruisers and 27 ''Cleveland''-class light cruisers, along with eight ''Atlanta''-class anti-aircraft cruisers. The ''Cleveland'' class was the largest cruiser class ever built in number of ships completed, with nine additional ''Cleveland''s completed as [[Independence-class aircraft carrier|light aircraft carriers]]. The large number of cruisers built was probably due to the significant cruiser losses of 1942 in the Pacific theater (seven American and five other Allied) and the perceived need for several cruisers to escort each of the numerous {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|2}}s being built.<ref name=FriedCru1/> Losing four heavy and two small light cruisers in 1942, the Japanese built only five light cruisers during the war; these were small ships with six {{convert|6.1|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns each.<ref>Watts, pp. 109\u2013113</ref> Losing 20 cruisers in 1940-42, the British completed no heavy cruisers, thirteen light cruisers ({{sclass2-|Crown Colony|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1943)|5}} classes), and sixteen anti-aircraft cruisers (''Dido'' class) during the war.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 33\u201335</ref>\n\n==Late 20th century==\n[[File:Kirov-class battlecruiser.jpg|thumb|Russian Navy battlecruiser of the {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}}, {{ship|Soviet cruiser|Frunze||2}}]]\n\nThe rise of air power during World War II dramatically changed the nature of naval combat. Even the fastest cruisers could not maneuver quickly enough to evade aerial attack, and aircraft now had torpedoes, allowing moderate-range standoff capabilities. This change led to the end of independent operations by single ships or very small task groups, and for the second half of the 20th century naval operations were based on very large fleets believed able to fend off all but the largest air attacks, though this was not tested by any war in that period. The US Navy became centered around [[carrier strike group|carrier groups]], with cruisers and battleships primarily providing anti-aircraft defense and shore bombardment. Until the [[Harpoon missile]] entered service in the late 1970s, the US Navy was almost entirely dependent on carrier-based aircraft and [[submarines]] for conventionally attacking enemy warships. Lacking aircraft carriers, the [[Soviet Navy]] depended on anti-ship cruise missiles; in the 1950s these were primarily delivered from [[Long Range Aviation|heavy land-based bombers]]. Soviet [[submarine-launched cruise missile]]s at the time were primarily for land attack; but by 1964 anti-ship missiles were deployed in quantity on cruisers, destroyers, and submarines.<ref name=ConwaysASCM>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 350\u2013354</ref>\n\n===US cruiser development===\nThe US Navy was aware of the potential missile threat as soon as World War II ended, and had considerable related experience due to Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks in that war. The initial response was to upgrade the light AA armament of new cruisers from 40&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm weapons to twin [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber gun mounts]].<ref>Friedman cruisers, pp. 361\u2013362</ref>  For the longer term, it was thought that gun systems would be inadequate to deal with the missile threat, and by the mid-1950s three naval SAM systems were developed: [[Talos missile|Talos]] (long range), [[Terrier missile|Terrier]] (medium range), and [[Tartar missile|Tartar]] (short range).<ref name=FriedCruMis1>Friedman cruisers, pp. 378\u2013382</ref> Talos and Terrier were nuclear-capable and this allowed their use in anti-ship or shore bombardment roles in the event of nuclear war.<ref>Friedman destroyers, p. 301</ref> [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] is credited with speeding the development of these systems.<ref>Friedman destroyers, pp. 293\u2013294</ref>\n\nTerrier was initially deployed on two [[Boston-class cruiser|converted ''Baltimore''-class cruisers]] (CAG), with conversions completed in 1955-56.<ref name=FriedCruMis1/> Further conversions of six ''Cleveland''-class cruisers (CLG) ({{sclass-|Galveston|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Providence|cruiser|5}} classes), redesign of the {{sclass-|Farragut|destroyer (1958)|4}} as guided missile \"frigates\" (DLG),<ref>Friedman destroyers, pp. 297\u2013298</ref> and development of the {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|0}} DDGs<ref>Bauer and Roberts, p. 211</ref> resulted in the completion of numerous additional guided missile ships deploying all three systems in 1959\u20131962. Also completed during this period was the nuclear-powered {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, with two Terrier and one Talos launchers, plus an [[ASROC]] anti-submarine launcher the World War II conversions lacked.<ref name=RegisterCG1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 153\u2013155</ref> The converted World War II cruisers up to this point retained one or two main battery turrets for shore bombardment. However, in 1962\u20131964 three additional ''Baltimore'' and {{sclass-|Oregon City|cruiser|0}} cruisers were more extensively converted as the {{sclass-|Albany|cruiser|4}}. These had two Talos and two Tartar launchers plus ASROC and two 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns for self-defense, and were primarily built to get greater numbers of Talos launchers deployed.<ref name=RegisterCG1/> Of all these types, only the ''Farragut'' DLGs were selected as the design basis for further production, although their {{sclass-|Leahy|cruiser|0}} successors were significantly larger (5,670 tons standard versus 4,150 tons standard) due to a second Terrier launcher and greater endurance.<ref name=RegisterDLG1>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 213\u2013217</ref><ref>Friedman destroyers, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> An economical crew size compared with World War II conversions was probably a factor, as the ''Leahy''s required a crew of only 377 versus 1,200 for the ''Cleveland''-class conversions.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 154, 214</ref> Through 1980, the ten ''Farragut''s were joined by four additional classes and two one-off ships for a total of 36 guided missile frigates, eight of them nuclear-powered (DLGN). In 1975 the ''Farragut''s were reclassified as guided missile destroyers (DDG) due to their small size, and the remaining DLG/DLGN ships became guided missile cruisers (CG/CGN).<ref name=RegisterDLG1/> The World War II conversions were gradually retired between 1970 and 1980; the Talos missile was withdrawn in 1980 as a cost-saving measure and the ''Albany''s were decommissioned. ''Long Beach'' had her Talos launcher removed in a refit shortly thereafter; the deck space was used for Harpoon missiles.<ref>Friedman cruisers, p. 398, 422</ref> Around this time the Terrier ships were upgraded with the [[RIM-67 Standard]] ER missile.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 552</ref> The guided missile frigates and cruisers served in the Cold War and the Vietnam War; off Vietnam they performed shore bombardment and shot down enemy aircraft or, as Positive Identification Radar Advisory Zone ([[PIRAZ]]) ships, [[radar picket|guided fighters]] to intercept enemy aircraft.<ref>Friedman cruisers, pp. 398\u2013400, 412</ref> By 1995 the former guided missile frigates were replaced by the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 580\u2013585</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Navy's guided-missile cruisers were built upon destroyer-style hulls (some called \"destroyer leaders\" or \"frigates\" prior to the 1975 reclassification). As the U.S. Navy's strike role was centered around aircraft carriers, cruisers were primarily designed to provide air defense while often adding anti-submarine capabilities. These U.S. cruisers that were built in the 1960s and 1970s were larger, often nuclear-powered for extended endurance in escorting nuclear-powered fleet carriers, and carried longer-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) than early ''Charles F. Adams'' guided-missile destroyers that were tasked with the short-range air defense role. The U.S. cruiser was a major contrast to their contemporaries, Soviet \"rocket cruisers\" that were armed with large numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) as part of the combat doctrine of saturation attack, though in the early 1980s the U.S. Navy retrofitted some of these existing cruisers to carry a small number of Harpoon anti-ship missiles and [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missile]]s.\n\nThe line between U.S. Navy cruisers and destroyers blurred with the {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|4}}. While originally designed for anti-submarine warfare, a ''Spruance'' destroyer was comparable in size to existing U.S. cruisers, while having the advantage of an enclosed hangar (with space for up to two medium-lift helicopters) which was a considerable improvement over the basic aviation facilities of earlier cruisers. The ''Spruance'' hull design was used as the basis for two classes; the {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|4}} which had comparable anti-air capabilities to cruisers at the time, and then the DDG-47-class destroyers which were redesignated as the ''Ticonderoga''-class guided missile cruisers to emphasize the additional capability provided by the ships' [[Aegis combat system]]s, and their flag facilities suitable for an admiral and his staff. In addition, 24 members of the ''Spruance'' class were upgraded with the vertical launch system (VLS) for Tomahawk cruise missiles due to its modular hull design, along with the similarly VLS-equipped ''Ticonderoga'' class, these ships had anti-surface strike capabilities beyond the 1960s\u20131970s cruisers that received Tomahawk armored-box launchers as part of the [[New Threat Upgrade]]. Like the ''Ticonderoga'' ships with VLS, the ''Arleigh Burke'' and {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|4}}, despite being classified as destroyers, actually have much heavier anti-surface armament than previous U.S. ships classified as cruisers.\n\n====US Navy's \"cruiser gap\"====\n{{main|United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification}}\n\nPrior to the introduction of the ''Ticonderoga''s, the US Navy used odd naming conventions that left its fleet seemingly without many cruisers, although a number of their ships were cruisers in all but name. From the 1950s to the 1970s, US Navy cruisers were large vessels equipped with heavy offensive missiles (including the [[Regulus missile|Regulus]] [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] cruise missile) for wide-ranging combat against land-based and sea-based targets. All save one\u2014 USS ''Long Beach''\u2014were converted from World War II cruisers of the ''Oregon City'', ''Baltimore'' and ''Cleveland'' classes. ''Long Beach'' was also the last cruiser built with a World War II-era cruiser style hull (characterized by a long lean hull);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/historic-navy-cruiser-uss-long-beach-to-be-auctioned-as-scrap-metal-by-government-liquidation-starting-tuesday-july-10-159701705.html|title=Historic Navy Cruiser, USS Long Beach, To Be Auctioned As Scrap Metal By Government Liquidation Starting Tuesday, July 10|date=12 June 2012|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"auctioned2012\">{{cite news|last=Censer|first=Marjorie|title=Historic nuclear cruiser headed to scrap heap|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/navy-auctions-uss-long-beach-historic-nuclear-cruiser-off-for-scrap/2012/09/18/7dd244b8-dccf-11e1-9974-5c975ae4810f_story.html|access-date=18 September 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 September 2012}}</ref> later new-build cruisers were actually converted frigates (DLG/CG {{USS|Leahy|DLG-16|6}}, {{USS|Bainbridge|DLGN-25|6}}, {{USS|Belknap|DLG-26|6}}, {{USS|Truxtun|DLGN-35|6}}, and the {{sclass-|California|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|cruiser|5}} classes) or uprated destroyers (the DDG/CG ''Ticonderoga'' class was built on a ''Spruance''-class destroyer hull).\n\nFrigates under this scheme were almost as large as the cruisers and optimized for [[anti-aircraft]] warfare, although they were capable anti-surface warfare combatants as well. In the late 1960s, the US government perceived a \"cruiser gap\"\u2014at the time, the US Navy possessed six ships designated as cruisers, compared to 19 for the Soviet Union, even though the USN had 21 ships designated as frigates with equal or superior capabilities to the Soviet cruisers at the time.  Because of this, in 1975 the Navy performed a massive redesignation of its forces:\n* CVA/CVAN (Attack Aircraft Carrier/Nuclear-powered Attack Aircraft Carrier) were redesignated CV/CVN (although {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}} and {{USS |Coral Sea|CV-43|6}} never embarked anti-submarine squadrons).\n* DLG/DLGN (Frigates/Nuclear-powered Frigates) of the ''Leahy'', {{sclass-|Bainbridge|cruiser|5}}, {{sclass-|Belknap|cruiser|5}}, {{sclass-|Truxtun|cruiser|5}} and ''California'' classes were redesignated CG/CGN (Guided Missile Cruiser/Nuclear-powered Guided Missile Cruiser).\n* {{sclass-|Farragut|destroyer (1958)|0}} guided missile frigates (DLG), being smaller and less capable than the others, were redesignated to DDGs ({{USS|Coontz|DDG-40|6}} was the first ship of this class to be re-numbered; because of this the class is sometimes called the ''Coontz'' class);\n* DE/DEG (Ocean Escort/Guided Missile Ocean Escort) were redesignated to FF/FFG (Guided Missile Frigates), bringing the US \"Frigate\" designation into line with the rest of the world.\n\nAlso, a series of Patrol Frigates of the {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|4}}, originally designated PFG, were redesignated into the FFG line. The cruiser-destroyer-frigate realignment and the deletion of the Ocean Escort type brought the US Navy's ship designations into line with the rest of the world's, eliminating confusion with foreign navies. In 1980, the Navy's then-building DDG-47-class destroyers were redesignated as cruisers (''Ticonderoga'' guided missile cruisers) to emphasize the additional capability provided by the ships' Aegis combat systems, and their flag facilities suitable for an admiral and his staff.\n\n===Soviet cruiser development===\nIn the Soviet Navy, cruisers formed the basis of combat groups. In the immediate post-war era it built a fleet of gun-armed [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|light cruisers]], but replaced these beginning in the early 1960s with large ships called \"rocket cruisers\", carrying large numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) and anti-aircraft missiles. The Soviet combat doctrine of saturation attack meant that their cruisers (as well as destroyers and even missile boats) mounted multiple missiles in large container/launch tube housings and carried far more ASCMs than their NATO counterparts, while NATO combatants instead used individually smaller and lighter missiles (while appearing under-armed when compared to Soviet ships).\n\nIn 1962-1965 the four {{sclass2-|Kynda|cruiser|1}}s entered service; these had launchers for eight long-range [[SS-N-3 Shaddock]] ASCMs with a full set of reloads; these had a range of up to {{convert|450|km}} with mid-course guidance.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 380</ref> The four more modest {{sclass2-|Kresta I|cruiser|1}}s, with launchers for four SS-N-3 ASCMs and no reloads, entered service in 1967-69.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 381</ref> In 1969-79 Soviet cruiser numbers more than tripled with ten {{sclass2-|Kresta II|cruiser|1}}s and seven {{sclass2-|Kara|cruiser|1}}s entering service. These had launchers for eight large-diameter missiles whose purpose was initially unclear to NATO. This was the [[SS-N-14 Silex]], an over/under rocket-delivered heavyweight torpedo primarily for the anti-submarine role, but capable of anti-surface action with a range of up to {{convert|90|km}}. Soviet doctrine had shifted; powerful anti-submarine vessels (these were designated \"Large Anti-Submarine Ships\", but were listed as cruisers in most references) were needed to destroy NATO submarines to allow Soviet [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get within range of the United States in the event of nuclear war. By this time [[Long Range Aviation]] and the Soviet submarine force could deploy numerous ASCMs. Doctrine later shifted back to overwhelming carrier group defenses with ASCMs, with the ''Slava'' and ''Kirov'' classes.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 345, 381\u2013382</ref>\n\n===Current cruisers===\nThe most recent Soviet/Russian rocket cruisers, the four {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|2}}s, were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Two of the ''Kirov'' class are in refit until 2020, and one was scheduled to leave refit in 2018, with the {{ship|Russian battlecruiser|Pyotr Velikiy||2}} in active service. Russia also operates three {{sclass-|Slava|cruiser|2}}s and one [[Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier|''Admiral Kuznetsov''-class carrier]] which is officially designated as a cruiser.\n\nCurrently, the ''Kirov''-class heavy missile cruisers are used for command purposes, as ''Pyotr Velikiy'' is the [[flagship]] of the [[Northern Fleet]]. However, their air defense capabilities are still powerful, as shown by the array of [[Point defense]] missiles they carry, from 44 [[9K33 Osa#Variants|OSA-MA]] missiles to 196 [[Tor missile system#3K95 Kinzhal|9K311 Tor]] missiles. For longer range targets, the [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] is used. For closer range targets, [[AK-630]] or [[Kashtan]] CIWSs are used. Aside from that, ''Kirov''s have 20 [[P-700 Granit]] missiles for anti-ship warfare. For target acquisition beyond the [[radar horizon]], three [[helicopter]]s can be used. Besides a vast array of armament, ''Kirov''-class cruisers are also outfitted with many sensors and communications equipment, allowing them to lead the fleet.\n\nThe United States Navy has centered on the aircraft carrier since World War II. The ''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers, built in the 1980s, were originally designed and designated as a class of destroyer, intended to provide a very powerful air-defense in these carrier-centered fleets.\n[[File:Type 055 destroyer.jpg|thumb|China's latest [[Type 055 destroyer]] has been classified by the United States Department of Defense as a cruiser because of its large size and armament.]]\nOutside the US and Soviet navies, new cruisers were rare following World War II. Most navies use guided missile destroyers for fleet air defense, and destroyers and frigates for cruise missiles. The need to operate in task forces has led most navies to change to fleets designed around ships dedicated to a single role, anti-submarine or anti-aircraft typically, and the large \"generalist\" ship has disappeared from most forces. The [[United States Navy]] and the [[Russian Navy]] are the only remaining navies which operate cruisers. Italy used {{ship|Italian cruiser|Vittorio Veneto|550|2}} until 2003; France operated a single helicopter cruiser until May 2010, {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|R97|2}}, for training purposes only.\n\nIn the years since the launch of {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} in 1981 the class has received a number of upgrades that have dramatically improved its members' capabilities for anti-submarine and land attack (using the Tomahawk missile). Like their Soviet counterparts, the modern ''Ticonderoga''s can also be used as the basis for an entire battle group. Their cruiser designation was almost certainly deserved when first built, as their sensors and combat management systems enable them to act as 'flagships' for a surface warship flotilla if no carrier is present, but newer ships rated as destroyers and also equipped with AEGIS approach them very closely in capability, and once more blur the line between the two classes.\n\n===Aircraft cruisers===\n[[File:VSTOL Guided Missile Cruiser CG VSTOL 1980.jpg|thumb|One cruiser alternative studied in the late 1980s by the United States was variously entitled a Mission Essential Unit (MEU) or CG V/STOL.]]\n{{main|Aircraft cruiser}}\n\nFrom time to time, some navies have experimented with aircraft-carrying cruisers. One example is the Swedish {{ship|HSwMS|Gotland|1933|2}}. Another was the Japanese [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']], which was converted to carry a large floatplane group in 1942. Another variant is the ''helicopter cruiser''. The last example in service was the Soviet Navy's {{sclass-|Kiev|aircraft carrier|4}}, whose last unit {{ship|Soviet aircraft carrier|Admiral Gorshkov||2}} was converted to a pure aircraft carrier and sold to [[India]] as {{ship|INS|Vikramaditya}}. The Russian Navy's {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} is nominally designated as an aviation cruiser but otherwise resembles a standard medium aircraft carrier, albeit with a [[surface-to-surface missile]] battery. The Royal Navy's aircraft-carrying {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|4}} and the Italian Navy's aircraft-carrying {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Giuseppe Garibaldi|551|2}} vessels were originally designated 'through-deck cruisers', but have since been designated as small aircraft carriers. Similarly, the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]'s {{sclass-|Haruna|destroyer|0}} and {{sclass-|Shirane|destroyer|0}} \"helicopter destroyers\" are really more along the lines of helicopter cruisers in function and aircraft complement, but due to the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], must be designated as destroyers.\n\nOne cruiser alternative studied in the late 1980s by the United States was variously entitled a Mission Essential Unit (MEU) or CG V/STOL. In a return to the thoughts of the independent operations cruiser-carriers of the 1930s and the Soviet ''Kiev'' class, the ship was to be fitted with a hangar, elevators, and a flight deck. The mission systems were Aegis, SQS-53 sonar, 12 [[SV-22]] ASW aircraft and 200 VLS cells. The resulting ship would have had a waterline length of 700 feet, a waterline beam of 97 feet, and a displacement of about 25,000 tons. Other features included an integrated electric drive and advanced computer systems, both stand-alone and networked. It was part of the U.S. Navy's \"Revolution At Sea\" effort. The project was curtailed by the sudden end of the Cold War and its aftermath, otherwise the first of class would have been likely ordered in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Cruisers in service or under construction==\n[[File:Jeanne D Arc 4.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|R97|2}} of the [[French Navy]], launched in 1961, decommissioned in 2010]]\n\nFew cruisers are still operational in the world navies.

NAAT for chlamydia may be performed on swab specimens [[sampling (medicine)|sampled]] from the cervix (women) or urethra (men), on self-collected vaginal swabs, or on voided urine.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gaydos CA | year = 2004 | title = Comparison of three nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens | url = | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 3041\u20133045 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.42.7.3041-3045.2004 |display-authors=etal| citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.7713}}</ref> NAAT has been estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of approximately 90% and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of approximately 99%, regardless of sampling from a cervical swab or by urine specimen.<ref name=Haugland2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Haugland S, Thune T, Fosse B, Wentzel-Larsen T, Hjelmevoll SO, Myrmel H | title = Comparing urine samples and cervical swabs for Chlamydia testing in a female population by means of Strand Displacement Assay (SDA) | journal = BMC Women's Health | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20338058 | pmc = 2861009 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6874-10-9 }}</ref> In women seeking an STI clinic and a urine test is [[Medical test|negative]], a subsequent cervical swab has been estimated to be positive in approximately 2% of the time.<ref name=Haugland2010/>\n\nAt present, the NAATs have regulatory approval only for testing urogenital specimens, although rapidly evolving research indicates that they may give reliable results on rectal specimens.\n\nBecause of improved test accuracy, ease of specimen management, convenience in specimen management, and ease of screening sexually active men and women, the NAATs have largely replaced culture, the historic [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for chlamydia diagnosis, and the non-amplified probe tests. The latter test is relatively insensitive, successfully detecting only 60\u201380% of infections in asymptomatic women, and often giving falsely positive results. Culture remains useful in selected circumstances and is currently the only assay approved for testing non-genital specimens. Other method also exist including: [[ligase chain reaction]] (LCR), direct fluorescent antibody resting, [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassay]], and cell culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm|title=Recommendations for the Laboratory-Based Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae \u2014 2014|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627175218/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm|archivedate=2016-06-27|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nPrevention is by [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]], the use of [[condom]]s, or having sex with only one other person, who is not infected.<ref name=CDCFact2016/>\n\n===Screening===\nFor sexually active women who are not pregnant, screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection.<ref name=\"AmFamPhys\"/> Risk factors include a history of chlamydial or other sexually transmitted infection, new or multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent [[condom]] use.<ref name=\"USPSTF\"/> For pregnant women, guidelines vary: screening women with age or other risk factors is recommended by the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) (which recommends screening women under 25) and the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (which recommends screening women aged 25 or younger).

The IFI in different GI sites have their special clinical features, which are often accompanied by various severe diseases. Although IFI associated with digestive diseases are less common, they can induce fatal outcomes due to less specificity of related symptoms, signs, endoscopic and imaging manifestations, and the poor treatment options.&nbsp;... Candida sp. is also the most frequently identified species among patients with gastric IFI.&nbsp;...  Gastric IFI is often characterised by the abdominal pain and vomiting and with the endoscopic characteristics including gastric giant and multiple ulcers, stenosis, perforation, and fistula. For example, gastric ulcers combined with entogastric fungal infection, characterised by deep, large and intractable ulcers,[118] were reported as early as the 1930s.&nbsp;...

Candidiasis is known to cause GI symptoms particularly in immunocompromised patients or those receiving steroids or antibiotics. However, only recently, there is emerging literature that an overgrowth of fungus in the small intestine of non-immunocompromised subjects may cause unexplained GI symptoms. Two recent studies showed that 26 % (24/94) and 25.3 % (38/150) of a series of patients with unexplained GI symptoms had SIFO. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas. The underlying mechanism(s) that predisposes to SIFO is unclear but small intestinal dysmotility and use of proton pump inhibitors has been implicated. However, further studies are needed; both to confirm these observations and to examine the clinical relevance of fungal overgrowth, both in healthy subjects and in patients with otherwise unexplained GI symptoms.&nbsp;...

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].\n\nTo do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a \"final control element\", such as a [[control valve]].<ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992).

The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.\n\nBy [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research.

For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics.\n\n==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]\n[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control. Control theory is concerned only with closed loop control.\n\nIn open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.\n\nIn closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the \"Reference input\" or  \"set point\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\" <ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970\n|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLikewise; \"A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Other examples===\nAn example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.\n\nA primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.\n\nIn a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n==Classical control theory==\n{{main|Classical control theory}}\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].\nA [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is \"fed back\" as input to the process, closing the loop.\n\nClosed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:\n* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)\n* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact\n* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized\n* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations\n* improved reference tracking performance\n\nIn some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.\n\nA common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].\n\n==Closed-loop transfer function==\n{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}\nThe output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.\n\nThis is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).\n\n[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]\n\nIf we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:\n\n: <math>Y(s) = P(s) U(s)</math>\n: <math>U(s) = C(s) E(s)</math>\n: <math>E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).</math>\n\nSolving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives\n\n: <math>Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \\right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).</math>\n\nThe expression <math>H(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}</math> is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If <math>|P(s)C(s)| \\gg 1</math>, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if <math>|F(s)| \\approx 1</math>, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.\n\n==PID feedback control==\n{{main |PID Controller}}\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.\n\nA PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\nThe [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.\n\nIf ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and <math>e(t)=r(t)- y(t)</math> is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form\n\n:<math>u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \\int e(\\tau)\\text{d}\\tau + K_D \\frac{\\text{de(t)}}{\\text{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters <math> K_P</math>, <math> K_I</math> and <math> K_D</math>, often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.\n\nApplying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation\n\n:<math>u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \\frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)</math>\n:<math>u(s) =  \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right) e(s)</math>\n\nwith the PID controller transfer function\n:<math>C(s) = \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right).</math>\n\nAs an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system <math>H(s)</math>, consider a 1st order plant given by\n\n:<math>P(s) = \\frac{A}{1 + sT_P}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>T_P</math> are some constants. The plant output is fed back through\n\n:<math>F(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + sT_F}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_F</math> is also a constant. Now if we set <math>K_P=K\\left(1+\\frac{T_D}{T_I}\\right)</math>, <math>K_D=KT_D</math>, and <math>K_I=\\frac{K}{T_I}</math>, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as\n\n:<math>C(s) =  K \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sT_I}\\right)(1 + sT_D)</math>\n\nPlugging <math>P(s)</math>, <math>F(s)</math>, and <math>C(s)</math> into the closed-loop transfer function <math>H(s)</math>, we find that by setting\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P</math>\n\n<math>H(s) = 1</math>. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.\n\nHowever, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1453566 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013576}}</ref> due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead\u2013lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.\n\n==Linear and nonlinear control theory==\nThe field of control theory can be divided into two branches:\n* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' \u2013 This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. \n* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' \u2013 This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincar\u00e9 map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]</ref>\n\n==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==\nMathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:\n* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.\n* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.\nIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the \"time-domain approach\") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. \"State space\" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.<ref>{{cite book|title=State space & linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=0-07-070096-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality \u2014AND\u2014 Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|year=1999|pages=705\u2013719 and 812\u2013828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614}}</ref>\n\n==System interfacing - SISO & MIMO==\nControl systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.\n* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) \u2013 This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. \n* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) \u2013 These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.\n\n==Topics in control theory==\n\n===Stability===\n\nThe ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.\n*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.\n*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.\n\nFor simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.\n\nMathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside\n* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.\n* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.\nThe difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the <math>x</math> axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the <math>\\rho</math> axis is the real axis.\n\nWhen the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.\n\nIf a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole in <math>z = 0.5</math> (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.\n\nHowever, if the impulse response was\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform is\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole at <math>z = 1.5</math> and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.\n\nNumerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.\n\nMechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.\n\n===Controllability and observability===\n{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}\n\n[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every \"bad\" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.\n\nSolutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.\n\n===Control specification===\nSeveral different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).\n\nA control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have <math>Re[\\lambda] < -\\overline{\\lambda}</math>, where <math>\\overline{\\lambda}</math> is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that <math>Re[\\lambda]<0</math>.\n\nAnother typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.\n\nOther \"classical\" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).\n\nModern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE,ISA,CQI).\n\n===Model identification and robustness===\nA control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.\n\n;System identification\n{{details|System identification}}\nThe process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass\u2013spring\u2013damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that <math> m \\ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \\Beta \\dot{x}(t)</math>. Even assuming that a \"complete\" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called \"nominal parameters\") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.\n\nSome advanced control techniques include an \"on-line\" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (\"identified\") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.\n\n;Analysis\nAnalysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.\n\n;Constraints\nA particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.\n\n==System classifications==\n\n===Linear systems control===\n{{Main|State space (controls)}}\nFor MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.\n\n===Nonlinear systems control===\n{{Main|Nonlinear control}}\nProcesses in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.<ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al>{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |laysummary = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralized systems control===\n{{Main|Distributed control system}}\nWhen the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.\n\n===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===\n{{Main|Stochastic control}}\n\nA stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.\n\n==Main control strategies==\nEvery control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.\n\n;List of the main control techniques\n\n*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.\n*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].\n*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746\u20132759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}</ref> [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to control a [[dynamic system]].\n*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain \"cost index\": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the \"optimal control\" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].\n*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}</ref> The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.

In typical stochastic control problems, it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller, and the control design must take into account these random deviations.\n*[[Energy-shaping control]] view the plant and the controller as energy-transformation devices. The control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection (in a power-preserving manner) in order to achieve a desired behavior.\n*[[Self-organized criticality control]] may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the [[self-organized]] system dissipates energy.\n\n==People in systems and control==\n{{Main|People in systems and control}}\nMany active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] invented the [[Z-transform]] in his work on [[probability theory]], now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems.

These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A chemical formula is not a [[chemical nomenclature|chemical name]], and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical [[structural formula]]. Chemical formulas can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of [[molecule]]s and [[chemical substance]]s, and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.\n\nThe simplest types of chemical formulas are called ''[[empirical formula]]s'', which use letters and numbers indicating the numerical ''proportions'' of atoms of each type. '''Molecular formulas''' indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on structure. For example, the empirical formula for glucose is CH<sub>2</sub>O (twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon and oxygen), while its molecular formula is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (12 hydrogen atoms, six carbon and oxygen atoms).\n\nSometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a [[condensed formula]] (or condensed molecular formula, occasionally called a \"semi-structural formula\"), which conveys additional information about the particular ways in which the atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] together, either in [[covalent bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, or various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension. An example is the condensed molecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH or CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH. However, even a condensed chemical formula is necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships between atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different [[substituent]]s.\n\nSince a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship between atoms in chemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and chemical formulas, at right). For reasons of structural complexity, there is no condensed chemical formula (or semi-structural formula) that specifies glucose (and there exist many different molecules, for example [[fructose]] and [[mannose]], that have the same [[molecular formula]] [[C6H12O6|C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>]] as glucose). Linear equivalent chemical ''names'' exist that can and do specify any complex structural formula (see [[chemical nomenclature]]), but such names must use many terms (words), rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that define a chemical formula.\n\nChemical formulas may be used in [[chemical equation]]s to describe [[chemical reaction]]s and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulas do not have the full power of structural formulas to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus [[Chemical equation#Balancing chemical equations|balancing chemical equations]] so that these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric charge.\n\n== Overview ==\nA chemical formula identifies each constituent [[chemical element|element]] by its [[chemical symbol]] and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of [[ethanol]] may be written C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is [[boron carbide]], whose formula of CB<sub>n</sub> is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.\n\nWhen the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple [[molecule]]s, chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. These types of formulas are variously known as ''molecular formulas'' and ''[[structural formula|condensed formulas]]''. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for [[glucose]] is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH<sub>2</sub>O. However, except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.\n\nFor simple molecules, a condensed (or semi-structural) formula is a type of chemical formula that may fully imply a correct structural formula. For example, [[ethanol]] may be represented by the condensed chemical formula CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, and [[dimethyl ether]] by the condensed formula CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>. These two molecules have the same empirical and molecular formulas (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), but may be differentiated by the condensed formulas shown, which are sufficient to represent the full structure of these simple [[organic compound]]s.\n\nCondensed chemical formulas may also be used to represent [[ionic compound]]s that do not exist as discrete molecules, but nonetheless do contain covalently bound clusters within them. These [[polyatomic ion]]s are groups of atoms that are covalently bound together and have an overall ionic charge, such as the sulfate {{chem|[S|O|4|]|2-}} ion. Each polyatomic ion in a compound is written individually in order to illustrate the separate groupings. For example, the compound [[dichlorine hexoxide]] has an empirical formula {{chem|Cl|O|3}}, and molecular formula {{chem|Cl|2|O|6}}, but in liquid or solid forms, this compound is more correctly shown by an ionic condensed formula {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+|[ClO|4|]|-}}, which illustrates that this compound consists of {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+}} ions and {{chem|[ClO|4|]|-}} ions. In such cases, the condensed formula only need be complex enough to show at least one of each ionic species.\n\nChemical formulas as described here are distinct from the far more complex chemical systematic names that are used in various systems of [[chemical nomenclature]]. For example, one systematic name for glucose is (2''R'',3''S'',4''R'',5''R'')-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucose's structural formula, but the name is not a chemical formula as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in chemical formulas. Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.\n\n== Empirical formula ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Acetic acid]] -->\n{{anchor|1=Empirical formulas}}\n{{main|Empirical formula}}\nIn [[chemistry]], the [[empirical formula]] of a chemical is a simple expression of the relative number of each type of atom or ratio of the elements in the compound. Empirical formulas are the standard for [[ionic compound]]s, such as {{chem|CaCl|2}}, and for macromolecules, such as {{chem|SiO|2}}. An empirical formula makes no reference to [[isomer]]ism, structure, or absolute number of atoms. The term ''empirical'' refers to the process of [[elemental analysis]], a technique of [[analytical chemistry]] used to determine the relative percent composition of a pure chemical substance by element.\n\nFor example, [[hexane]] has a molecular formula of {{chem|C|6|H|14}}, or structurally {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|3}}, implying that it has a chain structure of 6 [[carbon]] atoms, and 14 [[hydrogen]] atoms. However, the empirical formula for hexane is {{chem|C|3|H|7}}. Likewise the empirical formula for [[hydrogen peroxide]], {{chem|H|2|O|2}}, is simply HO expressing the 1:1 ratio of component elements. [[Formaldehyde]] and [[acetic acid]] have the same empirical formula, {{chem|CH|2|O}}. This is the actual chemical formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms.\n\n== Molecular formula ==\nMolecular formulas indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular substance. They are the same as empirical formulas for molecules that only have one atom of a particular type, but otherwise may have larger numbers. An example of the difference is the empirical formula for glucose, which is CH<sub>2</sub>O (''ratio'' 1:2:1), while its molecular formula is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (''number of atoms'' 6:12:6). For water, both formulas are H<sub>2</sub>O. A molecular formula provides more information about a molecule than its empirical formula, but is more difficult to establish.\n\nA molecular formula shows the number of elements in a molecule, and determines whether it is a [[binary compound]], [[ternary compound]], [[quaternary compound]], or has even more elements.\n\n== Condensed formula ==\n{{Main|Condensed formula}}\n[[File:Isobutane_numbered_2D.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Isobutane]] structural formula<br />Molecular formula: C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub><br />Condensed or semi-structural chemical formula: (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH]]\n\n{{Image frame|content=<chem>H-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop |}{\\underset{| \\atop \\displaystyle H}{C}}-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop |}{\\underset{| \\atop \\displaystyle H}{C}}-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop |}{\\underset{| \\atop \\displaystyle H}{C}}-\\overset{\\displaystyle H \\atop |}{\\underset{| \\atop \\displaystyle H}{C}}-H</chem>|align=right|width=155|caption=''n''-[[Butane]] structural formula<br />Molecular formula: C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub><br />Condensed or semi-structural formula: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>}}\n\nThe [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of [[isomer]]s) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a [[structural formula]] is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate [[molecular geometry|shape of the molecule]].\n\nA condensed chemical formula may represent the types and spatial arrangement of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] in a simple chemical substance, though it does not necessarily specify [[isomer]]s or complex structures. For example, [[ethane]] consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>. In [[ethylene]] there is a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only has two hydrogens), therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> or less commonly H<sub>2</sub>C'''::'''CH<sub>2</sub>. The two lines (or two pairs of dots) indicate that a [[double bond]] connects the atoms on either side of them.\n\nA [[triple bond]] may be expressed with three lines (HC\u2261CH) or three pairs of dots (HC:::CH), and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond.\n\nMolecules with multiple [[functional group]]s that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in [[parenthesis|round brackets]]. For example, [[isobutane]] may be written (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three [[methyl group|CH<sub>3</sub> groups]]. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, ''n''-[[butane]]: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n== Law of composition == \nIn any given chemical compound, the elements always combine in the same proportion with each other. This is the [[law of constant composition]].\n\nThe law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. If we look at the relative masses of oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule, we see that 94% of the mass of a water molecule is accounted for by oxygen and the remaining 6% is the mass of hydrogen. This mass proportion will be the same for any water molecule.<ref>{{cite web|title=Law of Constant Composition|url=http://www.everythingmaths.co.za/science/grade-10/13-physical-and-chemical-change/13-physical-and-chemical-change-03.cnxmlplus|website=Everything Math and Science|publisher=SIYAVULA|accessdate=31 March 2016}} [[File:CC-BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] This material is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.</ref>\n\n=== Chemical names in answer to limitations of chemical formulas ===<!-- what why here??? -->\n{{main|Chemical nomenclature}}\nThe alkene called '''but-2-ene''' has two isomers, which the chemical formula CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHCH<sub>3</sub> does not identify. The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (''cis'' or ''Z'') or on the opposite sides from each other (''trans'' or ''E''). Such extra symbols violate the rules for chemical formulas, and begin to enter the territory of more complex naming systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs noted above, in order to represent the full structural formulas of many complex organic and inorganic compounds, [[chemical nomenclature]] may be needed which goes well beyond the available resources used above in simple condensed formulas.  See [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]] and [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005]] for examples. In addition, linear naming systems such as [[International Chemical Identifier]] (InChI) allow a computer to construct a structural formula, and [[simplified molecular-input line-entry system]] (SMILES) allows a more human-readable ASCII input. However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are chemical naming systems, not formula systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Polymers in condensed formulas ===\n\nFor [[polymer]]s in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a [[hydrocarbon]] molecule that is described as CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>50</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, is a molecule with fifty repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter ''n'' may be used to indicate this formula: CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n=== Ions in condensed formulas ===\nFor [[ion]]s, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example, Na<sup>+</sup>, or Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The total charge on a charged molecule or a [[polyatomic ion]] may also be shown in this way. For example: [[Hydronium|H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]] or [[Sulfate|SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>]].  Note that + and - are used in place of +1 and -1, respectively.\n\nFor more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, which is found in compounds such as [[Caesium dodecaborate|Cs<sub>2</sub>[B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]]]. Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in [[Hexamminecobalt(III)_chloride|[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>Cl<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>]]. Here, (NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> indicates that the ion contains six [[ammine|NH<sub>3</sub> groups]] bonded to [[cobalt]], and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3. {{Elucidate|date=November 2012}}\n\nThis is strictly optional; a chemical formula is valid with or without ionization information, and Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride may be written as [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>Cl<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> or [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>.  Brackets, like parentheses, behave in chemistry as they do in mathematics, grouping terms together{{snd}} they are not specifically employed only for ionization states.  In the latter case here, the parentheses indicate 6 groups all of the same shape, bonded to another group of size 1 (the cobalt atom), and then the entire bundle, as a group, is bonded to 3 chlorine atoms.  In the former case, it is clearer that the bond connecting the chlorines is [[ionic bonding|ionic]], rather than [[covalent bond|covalent]].\n\n== Isotopes ==\n\nAlthough [[isotope]]s are more relevant to [[nuclear chemistry]] or [[stable isotope]] chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may be indicated with a prefixed [[superscript]] in a chemical formula. For example, the phosphate ion containing radioactive phosphorus-32 is &#91;<sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4</sub>&#93;<sup>3\u2212</sup>. Also a study involving stable isotope ratios might include the molecule <sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O.\n\nA left-hand subscript is sometimes used redundantly to indicate the [[atomic number]]. For example, <sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for dioxygen, and {{ComplexNuclide2|O|16|q=2}}  for the most abundant isotopic species of dioxygen. This is convenient when writing equations for [[nuclear reaction]]s, in order to show the balance of charge more clearly.\n\n== Trapped atoms ==\n[[File:Endohedral fullerene.png|thumb|180px|Traditional formula: MC<sub>60</sub><br>The \"@\" notation: M@C<sub>60</sub>]]\n{{main|Endohedral fullerene}}\nThe @ symbol ([[at sign]]) indicates an atom or molecule trapped inside a cage but not chemically bound to it. For example, a [[buckminsterfullerene]] (C<sub>60</sub>) with an atom (M) would simply be represented as MC<sub>60</sub> regardless of whether M was inside the fullerene without chemical bonding or outside, bound to one of the carbon atoms. Using the @ symbol, this would be denoted M@C<sub>60</sub> if M was inside the carbon network. A non-fullerene example is [As@Ni<sub>12</sub>As<sub>20</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>, an ion in which one As atom is trapped in a cage formed by the other 32 atoms.\n\nThis notation was proposed in 1991<ref name=YanChai>{{cite journal |title=Fullerenes wlth Metals Inside |author1=Chai, Yan |author2=Guo, Ting |author3=Jin, Changming |author4=Haufler, Robert E. |author5=Chibante, L.

The choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically (the at sign is included in [[ASCII]], which most modern character encoding schemes are based on), and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene.\n\n== Non-stoichiometric chemical formulas ==\n\n{{Main|Non-stoichiometric compound}}\n\nChemical formulas most often use [[integer]]s for each element. However, there is a class of compounds, called [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, that cannot be represented by small integers. Such a formula might be written using [[decimal fraction]]s, as in Fe<sub>0.95</sub>O, or it might include a variable part represented by a letter, as in Fe<sub>1\u2013x</sub>O, where x is normally much less than 1.\n\n== General forms for organic compounds ==\nA chemical formula used for a series of compounds that differ from each other by a constant unit is called a ''general formula''. It generates a [[homologous series]] of chemical formulas. For example, [[alcohols]] may be represented by the formula C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>(2n + 1)</sub>OH  (''n'' \u2265  1), giving the homologs [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[propanol]] for ''n''=1\u20133.\n\n== Hill system ==\nThe '''Hill system''' (or Hill notation) is a system of writing empirical chemical formulas, molecular chemical formulas and components of a condensed formula such that the number of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]] is indicated first, the number of [[hydrogen]] atoms next, and then the number of all other [[chemical element]]s subsequently, in [[alphabetical order]] of the [[chemical symbols]]. When the formula contains no carbon,  all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.\n\nBy sorting formulas according to the number of atoms of each element present in the formula according to these rules, with differences in earlier elements or numbers being treated as more significant than differences in any later element or number&mdash;like sorting text strings into [[lexicographical order]]&mdash;it is possible to [[collation|collate]] chemical formulas into what is known as Hill system order.\n\nThe Hill system was first published by [[Edwin A.

Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, [[Elytron|elytra]], distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all [[Family (biology)|families]], the [[Curculionidae]] (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except the sea and the [[polar region]]s. They interact with their [[ecosystem]]s in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and [[fungus|fungi]], break down animal and plant debris, and eat other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]], while others such as [[Coccinellidae]] (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.\n\nBeetles typically have a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] including the [[Elytron|elytra]], though some such as the [[rove beetles]] have very short elytra while [[Blister beetle|blister]] beetles have softer elytra. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in [[water beetle]]s which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are [[Endopterygota|endopterygotes]], which means that they undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile [[pupa]]l stage. Some, such as [[stag beetle]]s, have a marked [[sexual dimorphism]], the males possessing enormously enlarged [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are [[aposematism|aposematic]], with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective [[camouflage]].\n\nBeetles are prominent [[insects in culture|in human culture]], from the [[Scarab (artifact)|sacred scarabs]] of [[ancient Egypt]] to [[beetlewing]] art and use as [[pet]]s or [[insect fighting|fighting insects]] for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species are [[entomophagy|used as food]], mostly as [[larva]]e; species widely consumed include [[mealworm]]s and [[Dynastinae|rhinoceros beetle]] larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. Serious pests include the [[boll weevil]] of cotton, the [[Colorado potato beetle]], the [[Brontispa longissima|coconut hispine beetle]], and the [[mountain pine beetle]]. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the [[lady beetle]]s and [[dung beetle]]s are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Coleoptera SMNK.jpg|thumb|Coleoptera at the [[Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Karlsruhe]], Germany]]\n\nThe name of the taxonomic order, Coleoptera, comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''koleopteros'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), given to the group by [[Aristotle]] for their [[elytron|elytra]], hardened shield-like forewings, from ''koleos'', sheath, and ''pteron'', wing.

In the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] at the end of the Permian, some 30% of all insect species became extinct, so the fossil record of insects only includes beetles from the [[Triassic|Lower Triassic]] {{ma|220|mya}}.

In the stages of the Upper Triassic, [[algophagous|alga-feeding]] insects such as [[Triaplidae]] and [[Hydrophilidae]] begin to appear, alongside predatory water beetles. The first weevils, including the [[Obrienidae]], appear alongside the first rove beetles ([[Staphylinidae]]), which closely resemble recent species.<ref name=\"evo\"/> Some entomologists are sceptical that such early insects are so closely related to present-day species, arguing that this is extremely unlikely; for example, the structure of the metepisternum suggests that the Obrienidae could be Archostemata, not weevils at all, despite fossils with weevil-like snouts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David |last2=Engel |first2=Michael S. |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odQmAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA397 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-26877-7 |page=397 |quote=Triassic Curculionoidea have the same status as Triassic Chrysoleloidea: a relationship that is highly improbably and presently impossible to verify.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, a fossil beetle was described from the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] of [[Mazon Creek fossils|Mazon Creek]], Illinois, pushing the origin of the beetles to an earlier date, {{Ma|318|299|mya}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=B\u00e9thoux, Oliver |year=2009 |title=The earliest beetle identified |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=931\u2013937 |doi=10.1666/08-158.1}}</ref> Fossils from this time have been found in Asia and Europe, for instance in the red slate fossil beds of Niedermoschel near Mainz, Germany.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Die Insektentaphoz\u00f6nose von Niedermoschel (Asselian, unt.

The Scarabaeidae typically have lamellate antennae with the terminal segments extended into long flat structures stacked together. The Carabidae typically have thread-like antennae. The antennae arises between the eye and the mandibles and in the Tenebrionidae, the antennae rise in front of a notch that breaks the usually circular outline of the compound eye.

Digestion takes place mostly in the anterior [[midgut]], although in predatory groups like the [[Carabidae]], most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the [[Elateridae]], the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes.<ref name=insenc/> The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. This is followed by the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\n===Nervous system===\nThe [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n===Respiratory system===\n[[File:DytiscusSpiracles.png|thumb|''[[Dytiscus]]'' [[Spiracle#Arthropods|spiracle]]s (right) on upper side of abdomen, normally covered by the elytra, are in contact with an air bubble when the beetle dives.|left|175x175px]]Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for the [[oxygen]] it contains, and exhale [[carbon dioxide]], via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]].

In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final [[instar]]. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families [[Meloidae]] and [[Rhipiphoridae]], go further, undergoing [[hypermetamorphosis]] in which the first instar takes the form of a [[triungulin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242221698_A_contribution_to_the_knowledge_of_the_Meloidae_Coleoptera_fauna_of_Turkey_along_with_new_records |author1=Ozbek, H. |author2=Szalokia, D. |date=1998 |title=A contribution to the knowledge of the Meloidae (Coleoptera) fauna of Turkey along with new record |journal=Turkish Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |pages=23\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Mating===\n[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]\n\nSome beetles have intricate mating behaviour. [[Pheromone]] communication is often important in locating a mate.\nDifferent species use different pheromones. Scarab beetles such as the [[Rutelinae]] use pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarabs such as the [[Melolonthinae]] use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates is seen in the [[Firefly|fireflies]] (Lampyridae) which are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.<ref name=insenc/>\n\nBefore mating, males and females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his antennae on her head, palps, and antennae. In ''[[Eupompha]]'', the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.<ref name=insenc/> This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a [[Russia]]n population of [[tansy Beetle|tansy beetle]] (''Chysolina graminis'') is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Medvedev, L.

Many male beetles are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours.

Beetle eggs generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the [[Cupedidae]] have hard eggs. Eggs vary widely between species: the eggs tend to be small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of eggs.\nA female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime, depending on the extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which house, feed and protect their young.

Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of [[skin beetle]]s undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity.

In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host.

Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the appendages are not attached to the body and are said to be [[exarate]]; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as [[Pupa#Position in life cycle|obtect]] pupae).<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\nAdults have extremely variable lifespans, from weeks to years, depending on the species.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/><ref name=\"ausbeetle\" /> Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles.

The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles attached to the wing base; as long as the tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, [[Buprestidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]]), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins.<ref name=insenc/> The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies.

Some are [[omnivore]]s, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s ([[Staphylinidae]]), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey, such as earthworms and snails.

In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the [[avocado]] weevil ''[[Heilipus apiatus]]'' to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects.<ref name=\"Evans27\"/> Many beetles that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of that substrate.<ref name=\"Evans126\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]], p. 126</ref>\n\n====Mimicry and aposematism====\n[[File:Clyte b\u00e9lier - MHNT - Vue dorsale.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of wasps]]\n{{further|Mimicry|Aposematism}}\n\nSome [[longhorn beetle]]s (Cerambycidae) are effective [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of [[wasp]]s. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or poisonous, and are often [[aposematic]], where bright or contrasting [[animal coloration|coloration]] warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\n[[File:Blister beetle (26390828032).jpg|thumb|Blister beetles such as ''[[Hycleus]]'' have brilliant [[aposematic]] coloration, warning of their toxicity.]]\n[[File:Bloody -nosed Beetle^ Timarcha tenebricosa - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|The bloody-nosed beetle, ''[[Timarcha tenebricosa]]'', [[antipredator adaptation|defending itself]] by releasing a droplet of noxious red liquid (base of leg, on right)|left|172x172px]]\n\nChemical defense is important in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some [[Tenebrionidae]] use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/>\n\nOther species have special glands to produce deterrent chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, ''[[Anthia]]'' and ''[[Thermophilum]]'' \u2013 ''Thermophilum'' is sometimes included within ''[[Anthia]]'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].<ref name=\"Evans\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]]</ref> [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments.

These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around {{convert|100|C|F}}, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n====Other defences====\nLarge ground-dwelling beetles such as [[Carabidae]], the [[rhinoceros beetle]] and the longhorn beetles defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/> Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a drop-off reflex.

Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. [[Air France]] (AF) and [[British Airways]] (BA) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7,995, more than 30 times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=F2D_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 ''New Design Concepts for High Speed Air Transport''] edited by H.

With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.\n\nAmong other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia, and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.\n\nConcorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]], beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both A\u00e9rospatiale and BAC) also contributed.<ref name=\"BBC Concorde Grounded\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |publisher=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}\n\nAt the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nThis same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>Jan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html \"High altitude flying with F-104\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Slender deltas===\nSoon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich K\u00fcchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the \"slender delta\" concept.<ref name='deltawing'>{{cite journal |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723 |title=The development of the slender delta concept |journal=Aircraft Engineering |author=Maltby, R.L. |volume=40, 1968 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes |archivedate=26 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=aerosoc>{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}</ref> The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,<ref>''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236</ref> worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.<ref name=aerosoc />{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nK\u00fcchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.<ref name=aerosoc /> The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown /> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.\n\nK\u00fcchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 \"Wings On My Sleeve\"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>\n\n===Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee===\n[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]\n\nOn 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee'' (''STAC''),{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown /> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69&nbsp;mph, about \u2153 that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}\n\nSTAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nSTAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about \u00a375 to \u00a390&nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps \u00a350 to \u00a380&nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol 223|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\n===Ogee planform selected===\nK\u00fcchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the \"[[ogive|ogival]] wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\nGenerally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or \"lift point\") close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.<ref group=N>Or, more rarely, \"bent\" back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].</ref> With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]\n\nWhile the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,<ref>J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf \"Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)\"], RAE Bedford, 1964.</ref> but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].\n\n===Partnership with Sud Aviation===\nBy this time similar political and economic concerns in France<!-- do not link major countries--> had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about \"the following year\" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on K\u00fcchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nAs soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&nbsp;\u2013 above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that K\u00fcchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nThe only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}\n\n===Cabinet response, treaty===\nWhile the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\nWhen the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be \u00a3150&nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the \u00a3150&nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.\"{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nThis concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nAfter considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}\n\nThe development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com.

At [[Rotation (aviation)|rotation]], Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots [[indicated airspeed]]), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title=The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=iasa.com.au |date=13 May 2001 |first=David |last=Rose }}</ref> Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent [[tailstrike]]s.

Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.<ref name=\"Concorde nose\" />\n\n[[File:Concorde landing Farnborough Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|Concorde landing at [[Farnborough Aerodrome|Farnborough]] in September 1974]]\nA controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5\u00b0 below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off.

As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a \"thud\" was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor [[Compressor stall|engine surge]]. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.<ref name=AAIB89 /> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.<ref name=AAIB89 />\n* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.<ref name=AAIB93 /> The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The (AAIB) concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.<ref name=AAIB93 />\n* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.<ref>[http://spectator.org/print/39656 Joseph A.

Each 1 percent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 percent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-08/news/1995281022_1_ozone-sulfur-exhaust-particles|title=Increase in supersonic jets could be threat to ozone|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=8 October 1995|author=Newsday}}</ref>\n\nConcorde's technical leap forward boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/cjel5&div=9&id=&page=|title=Decision Analysis in Environmental Decisionmaking: Improving the Concorde Balance |first=Jon |last=Anderson |publisher=HeinOnline |date=1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> In France, the use of [[noise barrier|acoustic fencing]] alongside [[TGV]] tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.<ref>{{cite web|work=Environmental Science and Engineering |date=November 2001 |url=http://www.esemag.com/1101/1101ed.html |title=Train \u00e0 grande vitesse causes distress |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116124028/http://www.esemag.com/1101/1101ed.html |archivedate=16 January 2010 }}</ref> In the UK, the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] has issued [[Tranquillity#Mapping tranquillity|tranquillity maps]] since 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |title=National and regional tranquillity maps |publisher=Campaign to Protect Rural England |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914025157/http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |archivedate=14 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome sources say Concorde typically flew {{convert|17|mpgu.s.}} per passenger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concordesst.com/powerplant.html|title=CONCORDE SST : Powerplant |publisher=concordesst.com}}</ref>\n\n===Public perception===\n[[File:ConcordeBG.jpg|thumb|Parade flight at Queen's [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] in June 2002]]\n\nConcorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Business-and-Industry/24962872 |title=British Airways Concorde is expected to begin flying passengers again in next 6 weeks |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=23 August 2001 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was usually referred to by the British as simply \"Concorde\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2003/concorde_retirement/default.stm |title=Farewell to Concorde |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=15 January 2010 |date=15 August 2007}}</ref> In France it was known as \"le Concorde\" due to \"le\", the [[definite article]],<ref name=\"OxLangFrGlos\">[http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com/Public/PublicResources.html?direction=b-fr-en&sp=S/oldo/resources/fr/French-supp-05.xml Oxford Language Dictionaries Online&nbsp;\u2013 French Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612022620/http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com/Public/PublicResources.html?direction=b-fr-en |date=12 June 2010 }}: Glossary of Grammatical Terms</ref> used in [[French grammar]] to introduce the name of a ship or aircraft,<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/academie9/le Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales]&nbsp;\u2013 D\u00e9finition de LE, LA: article d\u00e9fini, II.3</ref> and the capital being used to distinguish a [[proper name]] from a [[common noun]] of the same spelling.<ref name=\"OxLangFrGlos\" /><ref>[http://grammaire.reverso.net/5_2_01_la_majuscule_dans_les_noms_propres.shtml Reverso Dictionnaire: La majuscule dans les noms propres] (\"Capital letters within proper names\")</ref> In French, the common noun ''concorde'' means \"agreement, harmony, or peace\". {{refn|'''concorde''' ''s.f.'' concord, unity, harmony, peace.{{sfn|Ferrar|1980|p=114}} |group=N}} Concorde's pilots and British Airways in official publications often refer to Concorde both in the singular and plural as \"she\" or \"her\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/concvidhome/public/en_gb |title=Celebrate Concorde: videos |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=15 January 2010}}<br />{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro3QVMCG-aY |title=Documentary of British Airways Concorde introduction |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>{{refn|Quote: [[Raymond Baxter]] commentating as Concorde flies for first time: \"She rolls ...

In the past, [[gunpowder]] was the primary propellant before the invention of [[smokeless powder]] in the 19th century. Cannon vary in [[caliber]], range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the [[battlespace|battlefield]]. The word ''cannon'' is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as ''tube'', ''cane'', or ''reed''. In the modern era, the term ''cannon'' has fallen into decline, replaced by ''guns'' or ''artillery'' if not a more specific term such as ''[[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]'' or ''[[howitzer]]'', except for high calibre automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called  [[autocannon]]s.<ref name=\"quora\">{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-field-gun-and-a-Howitzer|publisher=quora.com|title=What is the difference between a field gun and a Howitzer? \u2013 Quora|accessdate=26 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest known depiction of cannon appeared in [[Science and technology of the Song dynasty#Gunpowder warfare|Song dynasty China]] as early as the 12th century, however solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannon do not appear until the 13th century.{{sfn|Lu|1988}} In 1288 [[Yuan dynasty]] troops are recorded to have used [[hand cannon]]s in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=330}}{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=293}} Evidence of cannon next appeared in Europe.

Setting the bomb fuse was a problem. \"Single firing\" was first used to ignite the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the cannon's propellant. This often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up as it left the mortar. Because of this, \"double firing\" was tried where the gunner lit the fuse and then the touch hole. This, however, required considerable skill and timing, and was especially dangerous if the gun misfired, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was superfluous as the heat of firing would light the fuse.<ref>Tunis, p. 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0000132 Ballistik ^ Quadrant ^ Kanone.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary illustration on how a cannon could be used with the aid of [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]] for improved precision.]]\n[[File:Sixteenth Century Cannon2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|The use of [[gabion]]s with cannon was an important part in the attack and defence of fortifications.]]\n[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] emphasised the use of light cannon and mobility in his army, and created new formations and tactics that revolutionised artillery. He discontinued using all 12 pounder\u2014or heavier\u2014cannon as field artillery, preferring, instead, to use cannon that could be manned by only a few men. One obsolete type of gun, the \"leatheren\" was replaced by 4 pounder and 9 pounder demi-culverins. These could be operated by three men, and pulled by only two horses. Adolphus's army was also the first to use a cartridge that contained both powder and shot which sped up reloading, increasing the rate of fire.<ref>Manucy, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Finally, against infantry he pioneered the use of [[canister shot]] \u2013 essentially a tin can filled with musket balls.<ref>Tunis, p. 96.</ref> Until then there was no more than one cannon for every thousand infantrymen on the battlefield but Gustavus Adolphus increased the number of cannon sixfold.

A typical autocannon is the [[25 mm caliber|25&nbsp;mm]] \"[[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]]\" [[chain gun]], mounted on the [[LAV-25]] and [[M2 Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]]. Autocannons may be capable of a very high rate of fire, but ammunition is heavy and bulky, limiting the amount carried. For this reason, both the 25&nbsp;mm Bushmaster and the 30&nbsp;mm [[RARDEN]] are deliberately designed with relatively low rates of fire. The typical rate of fire for a modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels, such as a rotary autocannon, can have rates of fire of more than several thousand rounds per minute. The fastest of these is the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23|GSh-6-23]], which has a rate of fire of over 10,000&nbsp;rounds per minute.<ref name=\"Autocannon Rate of Fire\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Anthony G.|page=241|title=Rapid Fire|publisher=Shrewsbury: Airlife Publishing Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=1-84037-435-7}}</ref>\n\nAutocannons are often found in aircraft, where they replaced machine guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns.<ref name=\"Aircraft Cannon\"/>\n\n====Aircraft use====\n[[File:Westland C.O.W.

The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.<ref name=\"Early Aicraft Armament\">{{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Woodman | title = Early Aircraft Armament \u2013 The Aircraft and the Gun up to 1918 | publisher = [[Arms and Armour Press]] | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-85368-990-3}}</ref>\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI.jpg|thumb|left|[[Supermarine Spitfire]] with 20 mm cannon protruding from the leading edge of the wing]]\nThe first autocannon were developed during World War I as anti-aircraft guns, and one of these \u2013 the [[Coventry Ordnance Works]] \"[[COW 37 mm gun]]\" was installed in an aircraft but the war ended before it could be given a field trial and never became standard equipment in a production aircraft.

They continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement, as the rate of fire was still too low and the complete installation too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun almost entirely.<ref name=\"Aircraft Cannon\"/> The cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during the course of World War II, and newer fighters such as the [[Hawker Tempest]] usually carried two or four versus the six [[M2 Browning|.50 Browning machine guns]] for US aircraft or eight to twelve [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]s on earlier British aircraft. The [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannon]], [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]], and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. Cannon, as with machine guns, were generally fixed to fire forwards (mounted in the wings, in the nose or fuselage, or in a [[pannier]] under either); or were mounted in [[gun turret]]s on heavier aircraft. Both the Germans and Japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers, with the Germans calling guns so-installed ''[[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]]''. Schr\u00e4ge Musik derives from the German colloquialism for Jazz Music (the German word schr\u00e4g means slanted or oblique)\n\nPreceding the [[Vietnam War]] the high speeds aircraft were attaining led to a move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief that they would be useless in a [[dogfight]], but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern [[fighter aircraft]] are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on [[ground-attack aircraft]]. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]].<ref name=\"Aircraft Cannon\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695 |title=GAU-8/A |publisher=442nd Fighter Wing |accessdate=26 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719063934/http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> The [[Lockheed AC-130]] gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|title=Information on the GAU-8/A|publisher=The Language of Weaponry|accessdate=26 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619223736/http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|archivedate=19 June 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Both are used in the [[close air support]] role.\n\n==Cannon materials, parts, and terms==\n[[Image:Cannon-diagram2.svg|thumb|center|800px|Side elevation of a typical 19th-century cannon]]\nCannon in general have the form of a truncated cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an [[explosive charge]] and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its [[recoil]] and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.\n\nField artillery cannon in Europe and the Americas were initially made most often of [[bronze]], though later forms were constructed of [[cast iron]] and eventually [[steel]].<ref name=kingsbury>{{Cite book |title=An elementary treatise on artillery and infantry |last=Kingsbury |first=Charles P. |authorlink= |last2= |first2= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |edition= |volume= |year=1849 |origyear= |page= |publisher=GP Putnam |place=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9xVAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22cannon%22%20bronze%20iron&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=windage&f=false |accessdate= |isbn= |oclc=761213440 }}</ref>{{rp|61}} Bronze has several characteristics that made it preferable as a construction material: although it is relatively expensive, does not always alloy well, and can result in a final product that is \"spongy about the bore\",<ref name=kingsbury/>{{rp|61}} bronze is more flexible than iron and therefore less prone to bursting when exposed to high pressure; cast iron cannon are less expensive and more durable generally than bronze and withstand being fired more times without deteriorating. However, cast iron cannon have a tendency to burst without having shown any previous weakness or wear, and this makes them more dangerous to operate.\n\nThe older and more-stable forms of cannon were [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] as opposed to [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]]\u2014 in order to be used they had to have their ordnance packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than inserted through the breech.\n\nThe following terms refer to the components or aspects of a classical western cannon (c. 1850) as illustrated here.<ref name=kingsbury/>{{rp|66}}   In what follows, the words ''near'', ''close'', and ''behind'' will refer to those parts towards the thick, closed end of the piece, and ''far'', ''front'', ''in front of'', and ''before'' to the thinner, open end.\n\n===Negative spaces===\n* '''Bore''': The hollow cylinder bored down the centre of the cannon, including the ''base of the bore'' or ''bottom of the bore'', the nearest end of the bore into which the [[Artillery|ordnance]] ([[wadding]], [[Round shot|shot]], etc.) gets packed. The diameter of the bore represents the cannon's [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]].\n* '''Chamber''': The cylindrical, conical, or spherical recess at the nearest end of the bottom of the bore into which the [[gunpowder]] is packed.\n* '''Vent''': A thin tube on the near end of the cannon connecting the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]]; always located near the ''breech''. Sometimes called the ''fuse hole'' or the ''touch hole''. On the top of the vent on the outside of the cannon is a flat circular space called the ''vent field'' where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a ''vent piece'' made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.\n\n===Solid spaces===\nThe main body of a cannon consists of three basic extensions: the foremost and the longest is called the ''chase'', the middle portion is the ''reinforce'', and the closest and briefest portion is the ''[[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]]'' or ''cascable''.\n* '''The chase:''' Simply the entire conical part of the cannon in front of the ''reinforce''. It is the longest portion of the cannon, and includes the following elements:\n** The ''neck'': the narrowest part of the chase, always located near the foremost end of the piece.\n** The ''[[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]'': the portion of the chase forward of the ''neck''. It includes the following:\n*** The ''swell of the muzzle'' refers to the slight swell in the diameter of the piece at the very end of the chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a ''muzzle band''.\n*** The ''face'' is the flat vertical plane at the foremost edge of the muzzle (and of the entire piece).\n*** The ''muzzle mouldings'' are the tiered rings which connect the face with the rest of the muzzle, the first of which is called the ''lip'' and the second the ''fillet''\n*** The ''muzzle [[astragal]] and fillets'' are a series of three narrow rings running around the outside of the chase just behind the neck. Sometimes also collectively called the ''chase ring''.\n** The ''chase astragal and fillets'': these are a second series of such rings located at the near end of the chase.\n** The ''chase girdle'': this is the brief length of the chase between the chase astragal and fillets and the ''reinforce''.\n* '''The reinforce:'''  This portion of the piece is frequently divided into a ''first reinforce'' and a ''second reinforce'', but in any case is marked as separate from the chase by the presence of a narrow circular ''reinforce ring'' or ''band'' at its foremost end. The span of the reinforce also includes the following:\n** The ''[[trunnions]]'' are located at the foremost end of the reinforce just behind the reinforce ring. They consist of two cylinders perpendicular to the bore and below it which are used to mount the cannon on its carriage.\n** The ''rimbases'' are short broad rings located at the union of the trunnions and the cannon which provide support to the carriage attachment.\n** The ''reinforce band'' is only present if the cannon has two reinforces, and it divides the first reinforce from the second.\n** The ''breech'' refers to the mass of solid metal behind the bottom of the bore extending to the ''base of the breech'' and including the ''base ring''; it also generally refers to the end of the cannon opposite the ''muzzle'', i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the pressurized gas escapes.\n** The ''base ring'' forms a ring at the widest part of the entire cannon at the nearest end of the reinforce just before the ''cascabel''.\n* The '''cascabel:''' This is that portion of the cannon behind the reinforce(s) and behind the ''base ring''. It includes the following:\n** The ''knob'' which is the small spherical terminus of the piece;\n** The ''neck'', a short, narrow piece of metal holding out the knob; and\n** The ''fillet'', the tiered disk connecting the neck of the cascabel to the ''base of the breech''.\n** The ''base of the breech'' is the metal disk that forms the most forward part of the cascabel and rests against the breech itself, right next to the ''base ring''.\n\nTo pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first gunpowder is poured down the bore. This is followed by a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of [[windage]] allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.\n\nAny large, [[smoothbore]], muzzle-loading [[gun]]\u2014used before the advent of [[breech-loading]], [[rifled]] guns\u2014may be referred to as a cannon, though once standardised names were assigned to different-sized cannon, the term specifically referred to a gun designed to fire a {{convert|42|lb|sing=on}} shot, as distinct from a [[demi-cannon]] \u2013 {{convert|32|lb}}, [[culverin]] \u2013 {{convert|18|lb}}, or [[demi-culverin]] \u2013 {{convert|9|lb}}.

The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, and the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.<ref name=\"EB1771\">{{cite book|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|year=1771|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Edinburgh|chapter=Gunnery}}</ref>\n\nBefore loading, the cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a [[plumb-bob|plummet]]. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.<ref name=\"EB1771\"/>\n\n[[File:Firing of a 6 pound cannon.jpg|thumb|Firing of a 6-pound cannon]]\n[[Image:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|Cannon operation as described in the 1771 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'']]\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag of powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame.

This motion is typically translated into the motion of a [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]] on a [[Computer monitor|display]], which allows a smooth control of the [[graphical user interface]]. The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.  Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.  Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts. In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and \"wheels\", which enable additional control and dimensional input.\n\n== Naming ==\nThe earliest known publication of the term ''mouse'' as referring to a computer pointing device is in [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English's]] July 1965 publication, \"Computer-Aided Display Control\" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a [[mouse]], a [[rodent]], with the cord resembling its [[tail]].<ref name=\"OED\">Oxford English Dictionary, \"mouse\", sense 13</ref><ref name=\"Bardini1\">{{cite book |author-last=Bardini |author-first=Thierry |title=Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing |date=2000 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford |isbn=978-0-80473871-2 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEc1OOGmA5IC&pg=PA98}}</ref><ref name=\"BillEnglish\">{{cite book |author-last1=English |author-first1=William K. |author-last2=Engelbart |author-first2=Douglas C. |author-last3=Huddart |author-first3=Bonnie |title=Computer-Aided Display Control |date=July 1965 |publisher=[[Stanford Research Institute]] |location=Menlo Park |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914 |access-date=2017-01-03 |format=Final Report}}</ref>\n\nThe plural for the small rodent is always \"mice\" in modern usage.

Benjamin was then working for the British [[Royal Navy]] Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used [[analog computer]]s to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a [[joystick]].

The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A [[Computer#Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits|digital computer]] calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using [[pulse-code modulation]] radio signals. This trackball used a standard Canadian [[five-pin bowling]] ball.

The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.\n\nThe relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so hand movements are replicated by the pointer.<ref name=\"dummies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-your-computer-mouse.html |title=How to Use Your Computer Mouse |publisher=[[For dummies|dummies.com]] |access-date=2013-12-11}}</ref> Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called \"icons\" and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window.\n\nDifferent ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI:<ref name=\"dummies\"/>\n* Click: pressing and releasing a button.\n** (left) [[Point and click|Single-click]]: clicking the main button.\n** (left) [[Double-click]]: clicking the button two times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than two separate single clicks.\n** (left) [[Triple-click]]: clicking the button three times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than three separate single clicks. Triple clicks are far less common in traditional navigation.\n** [[Right-click]]: clicking the secondary button, or clicking with two fingers. (This brings a menu with different options depending on the software)\n** Middle-click: clicking the tertiary button.\n* [[Drag and drop]]: pressing and holding a button, then moving the mouse without releasing. (Using the command \"[[Right-drag|drag with the right mouse button]]\" instead of just \"drag\" when one instructs a user to drag an object while holding the right mouse button down instead of the more commonly used left mouse button.)\n* [[Mouse chording|Mouse button chording]] (a.k.a. Rocker navigation).\n** Combination of right-click then left-click.\n** Combination of left-click then right-click or keyboard letter.\n** Combination of left or right-click and the mouse wheel.\n* Clicking while holding down a [[modifier key]].\n* Moving the pointer a long distance: When a practical limit of mouse movement is reached, one lifts up the mouse, brings it to the opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface, and then replaces it down onto the working surface. This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.\n* Multi-touch: this method is similar to a multi-touch trackpad on a laptop with support for tap input for multiple fingers, the most famous example being the [[Apple Magic Mouse]].\n\n=== Mouse gestures ===\n{{Main article|Pointing device gesture}}\nUsers can also employ mice ''gesturally''; meaning that a stylized motion of the mouse cursor itself, called a \"[[Pointing device gesture|gesture]]\", can issue a command or map to a specific action. For example, in a drawing program, moving the mouse in a rapid \"x\" motion over a shape might delete the shape.\n\nGestural interfaces occur more rarely than plain pointing-and-clicking; and people often find them more difficult to use, because they require finer motor control from the user. However, a few gestural conventions have become widespread, including the [[drag and drop]] gesture, in which:\n\n# The user presses the mouse button while the mouse cursor hovers over an interface object\n# The user moves the cursor to a different location while holding the button down\n# The user releases the mouse button\n\nFor example, a user might drag-and-drop a picture representing a file onto a picture of a [[Trash (computing)|trash can]], thus instructing the system to delete the file.\n\nStandard semantic gestures include:\n* [[Crossing-based interface|Crossing-based goal]]\n* [[Drag and drop]]\n* [[Menu (computing)|Menu]] traversal\n* Pointing\n* [[Rollover (web design)|Rollover]] ([[Mouseover]])\n* [[Selection (user interface)|Selection]]\n\n=== Specific uses ===\nOther uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains. In interactive [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional graphics]], the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation. For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's \"head\" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head. A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined. 3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.\n\nWhen mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a [[Handedness|right-handed]] configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the [[Mozilla]] web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new [[Tab (GUI)|tab]] or [[window (computing)|window]] in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.\n\n== Variants ==\n=== Mechanical mice ===\n{{infobox| imagestyle = text-align: left\n| image = [[File:Mouse mechanism diagram.svg|frameless]]\n| caption = Operating an opto-mechanical mouse\n# Moving the mouse turns the ball.\n# X and Y rollers grip the ball and transfer movement.\n# Optical [[Incremental encoder|encoding]] disks include light holes.\n# Infrared [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] shine through the disks.\n# Sensors gather light pulses to convert to X and Y vectors.\n}}\nThe German company [[Telefunken]] published on their early ball mouse on 2 October 1968.<ref name=\"B\u00fclow_2009_Rollkugel\"/> Telefunken's mouse was sold as optional equipment for their computer systems.

It came as part of the hardware package of the [[Xerox Alto]] computer. Perpendicular [[Optical chopper|chopper wheels]] housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted [[trackball]] and became the predominant form used with [[personal computer]]s throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.\n\n[[File:Logitechms48.jpg|thumb|left|Mechanical mouse, shown with the top cover removed. The scroll wheel is gray, to the right of the ball.]]\n\nThe ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. These are located 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forward\u2013backward motion of the mouse and other the left\u2013right motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an [[Incremental encoder|encoder]] wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes.\n\nSimple logic circuits interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This [[Incremental encoder|incremental rotary encoder]] scheme is sometimes called quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately [[quadrature phase]]. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.\n\n[[File:HawleyMarkIImice.jpg|thumb|left|Hawley Mark II Mice from the Mouse House]]\n\nThe ball is mostly steel, with a precision spherical rubber surface. The weight of the ball, given an appropriate working surface under the mouse, provides a reliable grip so the mouse's movement is transmitted accurately.

The \"Color Mouse\", originally marketed by [[RadioShack]] for their [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] (but also usable on [[MS-DOS]] machines equipped with analog joystick ports, provided the software accepted joystick input) was the best-known example.\n\n=== Optical and laser mice ===\n[[File:HP Mouse M-U0031-O-1681.jpg|thumb|The underside of an optical mouse.]]\n{{Main article|Optical mouse}}\n\nOptical mice rely entirely on one or more [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and an imaging array of [[photodiode]]s to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics. A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.\n\nThe earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.\n\n=== Inertial and gyroscopic mice ===\nOften called \"air mice\" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other [[accelerometer]] (US Patent 4787051<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4787051.html|title=Inertial mouse system|website=Free Patents Online|access-date=2018-03-23|date=1988}}</ref>) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported. The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation. The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or \"[[gorilla arm]]\".\n\nUsually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased [[Usability|ease-of-use]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freshpatents.com/Highly-sensitive-inertial-mouse-dt20060727ptan20060164393.php |title=Highly Sensitive Inertial Mouse |website=Fresh Patents |access-date=2006-12-31}}</ref> In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.\n\n=== 3D mice ===\n{{redirect|SpaceBall|other uses|Spaceball (disambiguation)}}\nAlso known as bats,<ref>{{cite book |title=3D user interfaces |author-first1=Doug A. |author-last1=Bowman |author-first2=Ernst |author-last2=Kruijff |author-first3=Ivan |author-last3=Poupyrev |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-201-75867-2 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=It5QAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> flying mice, or wands,<ref>{{cite book |title=Exploring advanced manufacturing technologies |author-first1=Stephen F. |author-last1=Krar |author-first2=Arthur |author-last2=Gill |publisher=[[Industrial Press, Inc.]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8311-3150-0 |pages=8\u20136\u20134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkfsC77pdwC&pg=PT247}}</ref> these devices generally function through [[ultrasound]] and provide at least three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. Probably the best known example would be [[3Dconnexion]] (\"[[Logitech]]'s SpaceMouse\") from the early 1990s. In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse. This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons. The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kantek Fingers a Better Mouse|url=http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec17/art6.htm |website=Byte.com |access-date=2010-05-29 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224094906/http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec17/art6.htm |archive-date=2008-12-24}}</ref> Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.\n\nOne example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the [[Wii Remote]]. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the [[Infrared|IR]] emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the [[Wii Nunchuk|nunchuk]] accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the [[PlayStation Move]], the [[Razer Hydra]] and the controllers part of the [[HTC Vive]] virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vrlogic.com/html/3dconnexion/space_ball.html |title=Space Ball |publisher=Vrlogic.com |access-date=2010-05-29 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716145206/http://www.vrlogic.com/html/3dconnexion/space_ball.html |archive-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.

It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.\n\nWhen holding a typical mouse, [[ulna]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]] bones on the [[arm]] are crossed.

Cordless mice instead transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]]), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.\n\nWhile the electrical interface and the format of the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB, in the past it varied between different manufacturers. A [[bus mouse]] used a dedicated interface card for connection to an [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] or compatible computer.\n\nMouse use in DOS applications became more common after the introduction of the [[Microsoft Mouse]], largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse driver software. Thus, any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a driver that implements the same API, even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft's. This driver provides the state of the buttons and the distance the mouse has moved in units that its documentation calls \"[[#Mouse speed|mickeys]]\",<ref name=\"int33h\">{{cite web |url=http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/c/programming-bbrown/advcw3.htm#mouse |title=Interfacing to mouse.sys |accessdate=2011-10-08 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819232148/http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/c/programming-bbrown/advcw3.htm#mouse |archivedate=2011-08-19 |df= }}</ref> as does the [[Allegro (software)|Allegro library]].<ref name=\"allegro_mouse_routines\"> {{cite web|author=Hargreaves, Shawn; et al.|url= http://alleg.sourceforge.net/latestdocs/en/alleg004.html |title=Allegro manual: Mouse routines |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120415123653/http://alleg.sourceforge.net/latestdocs/en/alleg004.html |archive-date=2012-04-15}}</ref><!-- Yes, there were earlier mice, such as on the Sun workstation and even the original Microsoft \"green-eyed\" mouse.  If you want to write them up... -->\n\n=== Early mice ===\n[[File:Mouse quadrature encoding Lyon 1980.png|thumb|Signals XA and XB \"in quadrature\" convey X-direction motion, while YA and YB convey Y-dimension motion; here the pointer (cursor) is shown drawing a small curve.]]\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[Xerox Alto]] mouse, and in the 1980s the Xerox [[optical mouse]], used a [[Rotary encoder#Incremental rotary encoder|quadrature-encoded]] X and Y interface.  This two-bit encoding per dimension had the property that only one bit of the two would change at a time, like a [[Gray code]] or [[Johnson counter]], so that the transitions would not be misinterpreted when asynchronously sampled.<ref>Richard F. Lyon (1981), [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/VLSI-81-1_The_Optical_Mouse.pdf \"The Optical Mouse, and an Architectural Methodology for Smart Digital Sensors\"], Xerox PARC report.  \"The counters needed for X and Y simply count through four states, in either direction (up or down), changing only one bit at a time (i.e., 00, 01, 11, 10). This is a simple case of either a Gray-code counter or a Johnson counter (Moebius counter).\"</ref>\n\nThe earliest mass-market mice, such as on the [[Apple mouse#Models|original Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]] mice used a [[D-subminiature]] 9-pin connector to send the quadrature-encoded X and Y axis signals directly, plus one pin per mouse button.  The mouse was a simple optomechanical device, and the decoding circuitry was all in the main computer.\n\nThe [[DE-9 connector]]s were designed to be electrically compatible with the [[Joystick#Electronic games|joysticks]] popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[Atari 2600]].  Although the ports could be used for both purposes, the signals must be interpreted differently.  As a result, plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the \"joystick\" to continuously move in some direction, even if the mouse stays still, whereas plugging a joystick into a mouse port causes the \"mouse\" to only be able to move a single pixel in each direction.\n\n=== Serial interface and protocol ===\nBecause the IBM PC did not have a [[quadrature decoder]] built in, early PC mice used the [[RS-232]]C serial port to communicate encoded mouse movements, as well as provide power to the mouse's circuits. The Mouse Systems Corporation version used a five-byte protocol and supported three buttons. The Microsoft version used a three-byte protocol and supported two buttons. Due to the incompatibility between the two protocols, some manufacturers sold serial mice with a mode switch: \"PC\" for MSC mode, \"MS\" for Microsoft mode.<ref>[http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/showdoc.php?page=sermouse FreeDOS-32&nbsp;\u2013 Serial Mouse driver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302000300/http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/showdoc.php?page=sermouse |date=2009-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Apple Desktop Bus ===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg|thumb|[[Macintosh Plus|Apple Macintosh Plus]] mice: beige mouse (left), platinum mouse (right), 1986]]\n\nIn 1986 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] first implemented the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] allowing the daisy-chaining together of up to 16 devices, including arbitrarily many mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever. Featuring only a single data pin, the bus used a purely polled approach to computer/mouse communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models (including a number of non-Apple workstations) until 1998 when [[iMac]] joined the industry-wide switch to using [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Beginning with the Bronze Keyboard PowerBook G3 in May 1999, Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB, but retained an internal ADB connection in the [[PowerBook G4]] for communication with its built-in keyboard and trackpad until early 2005.\n\n=== PS/2 interface and protocol ===\n{{details|PS/2 connector}}\n[[Image:ps-2-ports.jpg|thumb|right|Color-coded PS/2 connection ports; purple for keyboard and green for mouse]]\nWith the arrival of the [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] personal-computer series in 1987, IBM introduced the [[eponym]]ous PS/2 interface for mice and keyboards, which other manufacturers rapidly adopted. The most visible change was the use of a round 6-pin [[mini-DIN connector|mini-DIN]], in lieu of the former 5-pin connector. In default mode (called ''stream mode'') a PS/2 mouse communicates motion, and the state of each button, by means of 3-byte packets.<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Adam |author-last=Chapweske |url=http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2mouse/ |title=Computer Engineering Tips \u2013 PS/2 Mouse Interface |publisher=Computer-engineering.org |date=2003-04-01 |access-date=2013-03-10}}</ref> For any motion, button press or button release event, a PS/2 mouse sends, over a bi-directional serial port, a sequence of three bytes, with the following format:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n!||Bit 7||Bit 6||Bit 5||Bit 4||Bit 3||Bit 2||Bit 1||Bit 0\n|- align=center\n!Byte 1\n|YV||XV||YS||XS||1||MB||RB||LB\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Byte 2\n|colspan=\"8\"|X movement\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Byte 3\n|colspan=\"8\"|Y movement\n|}\n\nHere, XS and YS represent the sign bits of the movement vectors, XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component, and LB, MB and RB indicate the status of the left, middle and right [[mouse button]]s (1 = pressed). PS/2 mice also understand several commands for reset and self-test, switching between different operating modes, and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors.\n\nA [[IntelliMouse|Microsoft IntelliMouse]] relies on an extension of the PS/2 protocol: the ImPS/2 or IMPS/2 protocol (the abbreviation combines the concepts of \"IntelliMouse\" and \"PS/2\"). It initially operates in standard PS/2 format, for backwards compatibility. After the host sends a special command sequence, it switches to an extended format in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements. The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously, with the difference that its 4-byte packets also allow for two additional buttons (for a total of five).<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/mcompat.mspx Retrieved 31 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408164755/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/mcompat.mspx |date=2008-04-08}}</ref>\n\nMouse vendors also use other extended formats, often without providing public documentation. The Typhoon mouse uses 6-byte packets which can appear as a sequence of two standard 3-byte packets, such that an ordinary PS/2 [[device driver|driver]] can handle them.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keyboard scancodes: The PS/2 Mouse|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-13.html |publisher=Win.tue.nl |access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref> For 3-D (or 6-degree-of-freedom) input, vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software. In the late 1990s, Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave 3D input to a few millimeters accuracy, which worked well as an input device but failed as a profitable product. In 2008, Motion4U introduced its \"OptiBurst\" system using IR tracking for use as a Maya (graphics software) plugin.\n\n=== USB ===\nThe industry-standard [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] (Universal Serial Bus) protocol and its connector have become widely used for mice; it is among the most popular types.<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 2007 |title=USB: A Technological Success Story |author-first=Jon |author-last=Gan |journal=HWM |issn=0219-5607 |publisher=SPH Magazines |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MesDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA49}}</ref>\n\n=== Cordless or wireless ===\nCordless or wireless mice transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]]).

Late-1980s era [[home computer]]s such as the [[Amiga]] used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer ([[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]] and [[The Settlers]] for example). The same idea is sometimes used in [[collaborative software]], e.g. to simulate a [[whiteboard]] that multiple users can draw on without passing a single mouse around.\n\n[[Microsoft Windows]], since [[Windows 98]], has supported multiple simultaneous pointing devices. Because Windows only provides a single screen cursor, using more than one device at the same time requires cooperation of users or applications designed for multiple input devices.\n\nMultiple mice are often used in multi-user gaming in addition to specially designed devices that provide several input interfaces.\n\nWindows also has full support for multiple input/mouse configurations for multi-user environments.\n\nStarting with Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a SDK for developing applications that allow multiple input devices to be used at the same time with independent cursors and independent input points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/multipoint/mouse-sdk/developer.aspx |title=Multipoint Mouse SDK |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |access-date=2012-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of Vista and Microsoft Surface (now known as [[Microsoft PixelSense]]) introduced a new set of input APIs that were adopted into Windows 7, allowing for 50 points/cursors, all controlled by independent users. The new input points provide traditional mouse input; however, they were designed with other input technologies like touch and image in mind. They inherently offer 3D coordinates along with pressure, size, tilt, angle, mask, and even an image bitmap to see and recognize the input point/object on the screen.\n\nAs of 2009, [[Linux]] distributions and other [[operating system]]s that use [[X.Org Server|X.Org]], such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[FreeBSD]], support 255 cursors/input points through [[Multi-Pointer X]]. However, currently no window managers support Multi-Pointer X leaving it relegated to custom software usage.\n\nThere have also been propositions of having a single operator use two mice simultaneously as a more sophisticated means of controlling various graphics and multimedia applications.<ref>{{cite conference |author-last1=Nakamura |author-first1=S. |author-last2=Tsukamoto |author-first2=M. |author-last3=Nishio |author-first3=S. |date=26\u201328 August 2001 |title=Design and implementation of the double mouse system for a Window environment |conference=IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing |publisher=IEEE |volume=1 |pages=204\u2013207 |doi=10.1109/PACRIM.2001.953558 }}</ref>\n\n== Buttons ==\n{{Main article|Mouse button}}\n\nMouse buttons are [[Miniature snap-action switch|microswitches]] which can be pressed to select or interact with an element of a [[graphical user interface]], producing a distinctive clicking sound.\n\nSince around the late 1990s, the three-button scrollmouse has become the de facto standard. Users most commonly employ the second button to invoke a [[context menu|contextual menu]] in the computer's software user interface, which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently sits. By default, the primary mouse button sits located on the left-hand side of the mouse, for the benefit of right-handed users; left-handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software.\n\n== Scrolling ==\n{{Main article|Scroll wheel}}\n\nNearly all mice now have an integrated input primarily intended for [[scrolling]] on top, usually a single-axis digital wheel or rocker switch which can also be depressed to act as a third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, [[trackball]], or [[touchpad]].\n\n== Mouse speed ==\nMickeys per second is a unit of measurement for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse,<ref name=\"int33h\"/> where direction is often expressed as \"horizontal\" versus \"vertical\" mickey count. However, speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves on the screen and how far the mouse moves on the mouse pad, which may be expressed as [[pixels]] per mickey, [[pixels]] per [[inch]], or pixels per [[centimeter]].\n\nThe computer industry often measures mouse sensitivity in terms of counts per inch (CPI), commonly expressed as dots per inch (DPI){{spaced ndash}}the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch. In early mice, this specification was called pulses per inch (ppi).<ref name=\"hawley\"/> The Mickey originally referred to one of these counts, or one resolvable step of motion. If the default mouse-tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen-pixel or dot on-screen per reported step, then the CPI does equate to DPI: dots of cursor motion per inch of mouse motion. The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse; the higher the CPI, the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement. However, software can adjust the mouse sensitivity, making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI. {{As of|2007|alt=Current}} software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically, taking into account the mouse's absolute speed and the movement from the last stop-point. In most software, an example being the Windows platforms, this setting is named \"speed,\" referring to \"cursor precision\". However, some operating systems name this setting \"acceleration\", the typical Apple OS designation. This term is incorrect. Mouse acceleration in most mouse software refers to the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant.\n\nFor simple software, when the mouse starts to move, the software will count the number of \"counts\" or \"mickeys\" received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels (or multiplied by a rate factor, typically less than 1). The cursor will move slowly on the screen, with good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold, the software will start to move the cursor faster, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the \"acceleration\" setting.\n\nOperating systems sometimes apply acceleration, referred to as \"[[ballistics]]\", to the motion reported by the mouse. For example, versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] prior to [[Windows XP]] doubled reported values above a configurable threshold, and then optionally doubled them again above a second configurable threshold. These doublings applied separately in the X and Y directions, resulting in very [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] response.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pointer ballistics for Windows XP |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pointer-bal.mspx |work=Windows Hardware Developer Center Archive |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=2002 |access-date=2010-04-29}}</ref>\n\n== Mousepads ==\n{{Main article|Mousepad}}\n\nEngelbart's original mouse did not require a mousepad;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gruntville.com/reviews/mousepads/corepad_roundup/index.php |title=Corepad Victory & Deskpad XXXL |author-first=Eric \"Unit24\" |author-last=Guy |access-date=2007-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060406032138/http://www.gruntville.com/reviews/mousepads/corepad_roundup/index.php |archivedate=2006-04-06 |df= }}</ref> the mouse had two large wheels which could roll on virtually any surface. However, most subsequent mechanical mice starting with the steel roller ball mouse have required a mousepad for optimal performance.\n\nThe mousepad, the most common mouse accessory, appears most commonly in conjunction with mechanical mice, because to roll smoothly the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide. So-called \"hard mousepads\" for gamers or optical/laser mice also exist.\n\nMost optical and laser mice do not require a pad. Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an optical mouse is largely a matter of personal preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface.\n\n== In the marketplace ==\n[[File:Assorted computer mice - MfK Bern.jpg|thumb|Computer mice built between 1986 and 2007]]\nAround 1981, Xerox included mice with its [[Xerox Star]], based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the Y-axis for looking up and down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.\n\nMany shooting genre players prefer a mouse over a [[gamepad]] [[analog stick]] because the mouse is a linear input device, which allows for fast and precise control. Holding a stick in a given position produces a corresponding constant movement or rotation, i.e. the output is an [[integral]] of the user's input, and requires that time be spent moving to or from its null position before this input can be given; in contrast, the output of a mouse directly and instantaneously corresponds to how far it is moved in a given direction (often multiplied by an \"acceleration\" factor derived from how quickly the mouse is moved). The effect of this is that a mouse is well suited to small, precise movements; large, quick movements; and immediate, responsive movements; all of which are important in shooter gaming.<ref name=\"gi2006\">Chris Klochek and I. Scott MacKenzie (2006). ''[http://www.yorku.ca/mack/GI2006.pdf Performance measures of game controllers in a three-dimensional environment]''. Proceedings of Graphics Interface 2006. pp. 73\u201379. Canadian Information Processing Society. {{ISBN|1-56881-308-2}}</ref> This advantage also extends in varying degrees to similar game styles such as [[third-person shooter]]s.\n\nSome incorrectly [[porting|ported]] games or [[game engine]]s have acceleration and interpolation curves which unintentionally produce excessive, irregular, or even negative acceleration when used with a mouse instead of their native platform's non-mouse default input device. Depending on how deeply hardcoded this misbehavior is, internal user patches or external 3rd-party software may be able to fix it.<ref name=\"pcgamingwiki\">{{cite web |title=Glossary:Mouse acceleration \u2013 PCGamingWiki PCGW \u2013 bugs, fixes, crashes, mods, guides and improvements for every PC game |url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Mouse_acceleration |website=[[PCGamingWiki]] |access-date=2015-07-26}}</ref>\n\nDue to their similarity to the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] [[desktop metaphor]] interface for which mice were originally designed, and to their own [[tabletop game]] origins, computer [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] are most commonly played with mice. In particular, [[real-time strategy]] and [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] games usually require the use of a mouse.\n\nThe left button usually controls primary fire. If the game supports multiple fire modes, the right button often provides secondary fire from the selected weapon. Games with only a single fire mode will generally map secondary fire to ''[[Iron sight|ironsights]]''. In some games, the right button may also invoke accessories for a particular weapon, such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer.\n\nGamers can use a scroll wheel for changing weapons (or for controlling scope-zoom magnification, in older games). On most first person shooter games, programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls. A keyboard usually controls movement (for example, [[WASD keys|WASD]] for moving forward, left, backward and right, respectively) and other functions such as changing posture. Since the mouse serves for aiming, a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag (latency) will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice. In some cases the right mouse button may be used to move the player forward, either in lieu of, or in conjunction with the typical [[WASD keys|WASD]] configuration.\n\nMany games provide players with the option of mapping their own choice of a key or button to a certain control. An early technique of players, [[circle strafing]], saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent at the center of the circle. Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse towards the opponent.\n\nGames using mice for input are so popular that many manufacturers make mice specifically for gaming. Such mice may feature adjustable weights, high-resolution optical or laser components, additional buttons, ergonomic shape, and other features such as adjustable [[#Mouse speed|CPI]]. [[Mouse Bungee]]s are typically used with gaming mice because it eliminates the annoyance of the cable.\n\nMany games, such as first- or third-person shooters, have a setting named \"invert mouse\" or similar (not to be confused with \"button inversion\", sometimes performed by [[Handedness|left-handed]] users) which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward (the opposite of non-inverted movement). This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks, where pulling back causes pitch up and pushing forward causes pitch down; computer [[joystick]]s also typically emulate this control-configuration.\n\nAfter [[id Software]]'s commercial hit of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which did not support vertical aiming, competitor [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'' became the first first-person shooter to support using the mouse to aim up and down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-use-of-freelook-in-a-fps |title=First Use of Freelook in a FPS |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> Games using the [[Build engine]] had an option to invert the Y-axis. The \"invert\" feature actually made the mouse behave in a manner that users {{As of|2006|alt=now}} regard as non-inverted (by default, moving mouse forward resulted in looking down). Soon after, id Software released ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', which introduced the invert feature as users {{As of|2007|alt=now}} know it.\n\n=== Home consoles ===\nIn 1988, the [[VTech Socrates]] educational video game console featured a wireless mouse with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games. In the early 1990s, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game system [[SNES Mouse|featured a mouse]] in addition to its controllers. The ''[[Mario Paint]]'' game in particular used the mouse's capabilities<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2011/aug/19/0819-e1-super-nostalgia-local-gamers-fondly/56755/ |title=Super Nostalgia: Local Gamers Fondly Remember Super Nintendo on Its 20th Anniversary |author-first=Casey |author-last=Phillips |publisher=[[Times Free Press]] |date=2011-08-19 |access-date=2015-10-18}}</ref> as did its successor on the [[Nintendo 64|N64]].

[[NEC]] sold official mice for its [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] and [[PC-FX]] consoles. [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] released an official mouse product for the [[PlayStation]] console, included one along with the [[Linux for PlayStation 2]] kit, as well as allowing owners to use virtually any [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] mouse with the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation 3|PS3]], and [[PlayStation 4|PS4]].

It uses the principles of [[emergency operation]]s: [[Hazard prevention|prevention]], [[#Mitigation|mitigation]], preparation, response, or [[emergency evacuation]] and recovery. Programs of this sort were initially discussed at least as early as the 1920s and were implemented in some countries during the 1930s as the threat of [[war]] and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] grew. It became widespread after the threat of [[nuclear weapon]]s was realized.\n\nSince the end of the [[Cold War]], the focus of civil defence has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. The new concept is described by a number of terms, each of which has its own specific shade of meaning, such as '''[[crisis management]]''', '''[[emergency management]]''', '''emergency preparedness''', '''contingency planning''', civil contingency''', civil aid''' and '''civil protection'''.\n\nIn some countries, civil defence is seen as a key part of \"total defence\". For example, in [[Sweden]], the [[Swedish language|Swedish word]] ''totalf\u00f6rsvar'' refers to the commitment of a wide range of resources of the nation to its defence - including to civil protection. Respectively, some countries (notably the [[Soviet Union]]) may have or have had military-organized civil defense units (Civil Defense Troops) as part of their [[armed forces]] or as a [[paramilitary]] service.\n\n== History ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Joan Baez]] -->\n<!--Use British spelling please -->\n\n=== Origins ===\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n[[File:It is far better to face the bullets.jpg|thumb|right|upright|British [[First World War]] poster, bringing attention to the threat posed by aerial bombardment from German [[Zeppelin]]s.]]\nThe advent of civil defence was stimulated by the experience of the bombing of civilian areas during the [[First World War]]. The bombing of the United Kingdom began on 19 January 1915 when German [[zeppelin]]s dropped bombs on the [[Great Yarmouth]] area, killing six people. [[Germany|German]] bombing operations of the First World War were surprisingly effective, especially after the [[Gotha G|Gotha]] bombers surpassed the zeppelins. The most devastating raids inflicted 121 casualties for each [[ton]] of bombs dropped; this figure was then used as a basis for predictions.\n\nAfter the war, attention was turned toward civil defence in the event of war, and the [[Air Raid Precautions]] Committee (ARP) was established in 1924 to investigate ways for ensuring the protection of civilians from the danger of [[Aerial bombing of cities#European theatre|air-raids]].\n\nThe Committee produced figures estimating that in [[London]] there would be 9,000 casualties in the first two days and then a continuing rate of 17,500 casualties a week. These rates were thought conservative. It was believed that there would be \"total chaos and panic\" and hysterical neurosis as the people of London would try to flee the city. To control the population harsh measures were proposed: bringing London under almost military control, and physically cordoning off the city with 120,000 troops to force people back to work. A different government department proposed setting up camps for [[refugee]]s for a few days before sending them back to London.\n\nA special government department, the [[Civil Defence Service]], was established by the [[Home Office]] in 1935. Its remit included the pre-existing ARP as well as wardens, firemen (initially the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] (AFS) and latterly the [[National Fire Service]] (NFS)), fire watchers, rescue, first aid post, stretcher party and industry. Over 1.9 million people served within the CD; nearly 2,400 lost their lives to enemy action.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 102384 Air Raid Warden testing new equipment in Brisbane, October 1942.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air Raid Precautions|Air Raid Warden]] testing his equipment in Brisbane in October 1942.]]\nThe organisation of civil defence was the responsibility of the local authority. Volunteers were ascribed to different units depending on experience or training. Each local civil defence service was divided into several sections. Wardens were responsible for local [[reconnaissance]] and reporting, and leadership, organisation, guidance and control of the general public. Wardens would also advise survivors of the locations of rest and food centres, and other welfare facilities.\n\nRescue Parties were required to assess and then access bombed-out buildings and retrieve injured or dead people. In addition they would turn off [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[water supply|water supplies]], and repair or pull down unsteady buildings. Medical services, including [[First Aid|First Aid Parties]], provided on the spot medical assistance.\n\nThe expected stream of information that would be generated during an attack was handled by 'Report and Control' teams. A local [[headquarter]]s would have an ARP controller who would direct rescue, first aid and [[decontamination]] teams to the scenes of reported bombing. If local services were deemed insufficient to deal with the incident then the controller could request assistance from surrounding [[borough]]s.\n\nFire Guards were responsible for a designated area/building and required to monitor the fall of [[incendiary bomb]]s and pass on news of any fires that had broken out to the NFS. They could deal with an individual [[Elektron (alloy)|magnesium electron incendiary bomb]] by dousing it with buckets of sand or water or by smothering. Additionally, 'Gas Decontamination Teams' kitted out with gas-tight and [[waterproof]] [[protective clothing]] were to deal with any [[gas attack]]s. They were trained to decontaminate buildings, roads, rail and other material that had been contaminated by liquid or jelly gases.\n\n[[File:The Home Front in Britain during the Second World War HU36196.jpg|thumb|[[Anderson shelter]]s were widely distributed in the United Kingdom by civil defence authorities, in preparation for aerial bombardment.]]\nLittle progress was made over the issue of [[air-raid shelter]]s, because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the need to send the public underground for shelter and the need to keep them above ground for protection against gas attacks. In February 1936 the [[Home Secretary]] appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack. During the [[Munich crisis]], local authorities dug trenches to provide shelter. After the crisis, the British Government decided to make these a permanent feature, with a standard design of precast concrete trench lining. They also decided to issue the [[Anderson shelter]] free to poorer households and to provide steel props to create shelters in suitable basements.<ref>{{Citation|last=Baker|first=Lord John |authorlink=John Baker, Baron Baker |year=1978 |title=Enterprise vs Bureaucracy - The Development of Structural Air Raid Precautions during the 2nd World War |publisher=Pergamon Press}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the ARP was responsible for the issuing of [[gas mask]]s, pre-fabricated [[air-raid shelter]]s (such as [[Anderson shelter]]s, as well as [[Morrison shelter]]s), the upkeep of local public shelters, and the maintenance of the [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]]. The ARP also helped rescue people after air raids and other attacks, and some women became ARP Ambulance Attendants whose job was to help administer first aid to casualties, search for survivors, and in many grim instances, help recover bodies, sometimes those of their own colleagues.\n[[File:JerusalemFW1940.jpg|thumb|Jewish Civil Defense group in [[Jerusalem]] in 1942.

Composer [[Josef Tal]] stands next to the woman with a black sweater.]]\n\nAs the war progressed, the military effectiveness of Germany's aerial bombardment was very limited. Thanks to the Luftwaffe's shifting aims, the strength of British air defenses, the use of early warning radar and the life-saving actions of local civil defense units, the aerial \"Blitz\" during the [[Battle of Britain]] failed to break the morale of the British people, destroy the Royal Air Force or significantly hinder British industrial production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Britain-European-history-1940|title=Battle of Britain {{!}} European history [1940]|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref> Despite a significant investment in civil and military defense, British civilian losses during the Blitz were higher than in most strategic bombing campaigns throughout the war.

It coordinated with the [[Department of the Army]] and established similar groups to the British ARP. One of these groups that still exists today is the [[Civil Air Patrol]], which was originally created as a civilian auxiliary to the [[US Army|Army]]. The CAP was created on December 1, 1941, with the main civil defense mission of search and rescue. The CAP also sank two Axis submarines and provided aerial reconnaissance for Allied and neutral merchant ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/about|title=History of Civil Air Patrol - Civil Air Patrol - United States Air Force Auxiliary|first=Global Reach Internet Productions, LLC - Ames, IA -|last=globalreach.com|publisher=}}</ref> In 1946, the Civil Air Patrol was barred from combat by [[Public Law 79-476]]. The CAP then received its current mission: search and rescue for downed aircraft.

With the onset of the growing [[Cold War|tensions between East and West]], the service was revived in 1949 as the [[Civil Defence Corps]]. As a civilian volunteer organisation, it was tasked to take control in the aftermath of a major national emergency, principally envisaged as being a Cold War [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]]. Although under the authority of the [[Home Office]], with a centralised administrative establishment, the corps was administered locally by Corps Authorities. In general every [[counties of the United Kingdom|county]] was a Corps Authority, as were most [[county borough]]s in [[England and Wales]] and large [[burgh]]s in [[Scotland]].\n\nEach division was divided into several sections, including the Headquarters, Intelligence and Operations, Scientific and Reconnaissance, Warden & Rescue, Ambulance and First Aid and Welfare.\n\nIn 1954 [[Coventry City Council]] caused international controversy when it announced plans to disband its Civil Defence committee because the councillors had decided that hydrogen bombs meant that there could be no recovery from a nuclear attack. The British government opposed such a move and held a provocative Civil Defence exercise on the streets of Coventry which Labour council members protested against.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Barnett |first=Nicholas |date=2015-07-03 |title=\u2018No protection against the H-bomb\u2019: press and popular reactions to the Coventry civil defence controversy, 1954 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14682745.2014.968558 |journal=Cold War History |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=277\u2013300 |doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.968558 |issn=1468-2745}}</ref> The government also decided to implement its own committee at the city's cost until the council reinstituted its committee.\n\nIn the '''United States''', the sheer power of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the perceived likelihood of such an attack precipitated a greater response than had yet been required of civil defense. Civil defense,  previously considered an important and commonsense step, became divisive and controversial in the charged atmosphere of the [[Cold War]]. In 1950, the [[National Security Resources Board]] created a 162-page document outlining a model civil defense structure for the U.S.  Called the \"Blue Book\" by civil defense professionals in reference to its solid blue cover, it was the template for legislation and organization for the next 40 years.<ref>National Security Resources Board.

These shelters would not protect against the blast and heat effects of nuclear weapons, but would provide some protection against the radiation effects that would last for weeks and even affect areas distant from a nuclear explosion. In order for most of these preparations to be effective, there had to be some degree of warning. In 1951, [[CONELRAD]] (Control of Electromagnetic Radiation) was established. Under the system, a few primary stations would be alerted of an emergency and would broadcast an alert.  All broadcast stations throughout the country would be constantly listening to an upstream station and repeat the message, thus passing it from station to station.\n\nIn a once classified US [[Military simulation|war game]] analysis, looking at varying levels of war escalation, warning and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\">[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb480/docs/doc%2010A%201963.pdf Net Evaluation Subcommittee. page 27]</ref> At the time, however, the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as less effective in [[cost-benefit analysis]] than a [[ballistic missile defense]] ([[Nike Zeus]]) system, and as the Soviet adversary was increasing their [[nuclear stockpile]], the [[efficacy]] of both would follow a [[diminishing returns]] trend.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\"/>\n\nContrary to the largely noncommittal approach taken in [[NATO]], with its stops and starts in civil defense depending on the whims of each newly elected government, the military strategy in the comparatively more ideologically consistent '''[[USSR]]''' held that, amongst other things, a winnable nuclear war was possible.<ref name=Pipes>{{cite web|url=http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-422-2012-S1_NP/Syllabus/EReadings/05.2/05.2.Pipes1977Why-the-Soviet-Union.pdf |title=Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War |author=Richard Pipes |publisher=Commentary [[Reed College]] |year=1977 |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/63015546/Why-Russia-Thinks-It-Could-Fight-and-Win-a-Nuclear-War |title=Why the Soviet Union thinks it can fight and win a Nuclear War |author=Richard Pipes |publisher=Commentary |year=1977 |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"gwu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv//nukevault/ebb285 |title=Previously Classified Interviews with Former Soviet Officials Reveal U.S. Strategic Intelligence Failure Over Decades |editor1-last=Burr |editor1-first=William |editor2-last=Savranskaya |editor2-first=Svetlana |date=September 11, 2009 |location=[[Washington, DC]] |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> To this effect the [[Soviet]]s planned to minimize, as far as possible, the effects of nuclear weapon strikes on its territory, and therefore spent considerably more thought on civil defense preparations than in U.S., with defense plans that have been assessed to be far more effective than those in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1977/mar-apr/dorough.html |title =Soviet Civil Defense U.S.S.R. preparations for industrial-base war survival. |author=Captain John W.

In 2002 this became part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. The focus was shifted from nuclear war to an \"all-hazards\" approach of [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]]. [[Natural disaster]]s and the emergence of new threats such as [[terrorism]] have caused attention to be focused away from traditional civil defense and into new forms of civil protection such as [[emergency management]] and [[homeland security]].\n\n=== Today ===\nMany [[Civil defense by country|countries]] still maintain a national Civil Defence Corps, usually having a wide brief for assisting in large scale civil emergencies such as flood, earthquake, invasion, or civil disorder.\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, in the United States the concept of civil defense has been revisited under the umbrella term of [[homeland security]] and all-hazards emergency management.\n\nIn [[Europe]], the triangle CD logo continues to be widely used.

In recent years there has been emphasis on preparedness for technological disasters resulting from terrorist attack. Within EU countries the term \"crisis-management\" emphasises the political and security dimension rather than measures to satisfy the immediate needs of the population.\n\nIn Australia, civil defence is the responsibility of the volunteer-based [[State Emergency Service]].\n\nIn most former Soviet countries civil defence is the responsibility of governmental ministries, such as Russia's [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]].\n\n== Importance ==\nRelatively small investments in preparation can speed up recovery by months or years and thereby prevent millions of deaths by hunger, cold and disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to [[human capital]] theory in [[economics]], a country's population is more valuable than all of the land, factories and other assets that it possesses. People rebuild a country after its destruction, and it is therefore important for the economic security of a country that it protect its people. According to [[psychology]], it is important for people to feel as though they are in control of their own destiny, and preparing for uncertainty via civil defense may help to achieve this.\n\nIn the United States, the federal civil defense program was authorised by statute and ran from 1951 to 1994. Originally authorised by Public Law 920 of the 81st Congress, it was repealed by Public Law 93-337 in 1994. Small portions of that statutory scheme were incorporated into the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act]] (Public Law 100-707) which partly superseded in part, partly amended, and partly supplemented the [[Disaster Relief Act of 1974]] (Public Law 93-288). In the portions of the civil defense statute incorporated into the Stafford Act, the primary modification was to use the term \"[[Emergency Preparedness]]\" wherever the term \"Civil Defence\" had previously appeared in the statutory language.\n\nAn important concept initiated by President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the so-called \"Crisis Relocation Program\" administered as part of the federal civil defense program. That effort largely lapsed under President Ronald Reagan, who discontinued the Carter initiative because of opposition from areas potentially hosting the relocated population.<ref>See [http://www.fas.or/irp/offdocs/prm/prm32.pdf Presidential Review Memorandum/NSC-32] (September 30, 1977) and [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pd/pd41.pdf Presidential Decision Memorandum 42]</ref>\n\n== Threat assessment ==\n\nThreats to civilians and civilian life include NBC ([[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]], [[Biological warfare|Biological]], and [[Chemical warfare]]) and others, like the more modern term [[CBRN]] (Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear). [[Threat assessment]] involves studying each threat so that preventative measures can be built into civilian life.\n\n;Conventional\n\nRefers to conventional explosives. A [[blast shelter]] designed to protect only from radiation and fallout would be much more vulnerable to conventional explosives. See also [[fallout shelter]].\n\n;Nuclear\n\nShelter intended to protect against nuclear blast effects would include thick concrete and other sturdy elements which are resistant to conventional explosives. The biggest threats from a nuclear attack are effects from the blast, fires and radiation. One of the most prepared countries for a nuclear attack is [[Switzerland]]. Almost every building in Switzerland has an ''abri'' (shelter) against the initial nuclear bomb and explosion followed by the fall-out.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_world | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=2011-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=2007-02-10}}</ref> Because of this, many people use it as a safe to protect valuables, photos, financial information and so on. Switzerland also has air-raid and nuclear-raid sirens in every village.\n\n;Dirty Bomb\nA \"radiologically enhanced weapon,\" or \"[[dirty bomb]]\", uses an explosive to spread radioactive material. This is a theoretical risk, and such weapons have not been used by terrorists. Depending on the quantity of the radioactive material, the dangers may be mainly psychological. Toxic effects can be managed by standard [[dangerous goods|hazmat]] techniques.\n\n;Biological\n\nThe threat here is primarily from disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.\n\n;Chemical\n\nVarious chemical agents are a threat, such as [[nerve gas]] ([[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], [[Sarin]], and so on.).\n\n== Stages ==\n\n=== Mitigation ===\n[[Image:T38.jpg|thumb|right|Civil defense logo on an Air raid [[siren (alarm)|siren]] control box in [[Kansas]], US.]]\n[[Image:Civil Defense Logo.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Civil Defense logo on a [[Thunderbolt siren|Thunderbolt 1003]] siren.]]\n\nMitigation is the process of actively preventing the war or the release of [[nuclear weapon]]s. It includes policy analysis, diplomacy, political measures, [[nuclear disarmament]] and more military responses such as a [[National Missile Defense]] and [[air defense artillery]]. In the case of counter-terrorism, mitigation would include diplomacy, [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] gathering and direct action against terrorist groups. Mitigation may also be reflected in long-term planning such as the design of the [[interstate highway]] system and the placement of military bases further away from populated areas.\n\n=== Preparation ===\n\nPreparation consists of building [[blast shelter]]s and pre-positioning information, supplies, and emergency infrastructure. For example, most larger cities in the U.S. now have underground emergency operations centres that can perform civil defense coordination. FEMA also has many underground facilities for the same purpose located near major railheads such as the ones in [[Denton, Texas]] and [[Mount Weather]], Virginia.\n\nOther measures would include continual government inventories of grain silos, the [[Strategic National Stockpile]], the uncapping of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], the dispersal of lorry-transportable bridges, water purification, mobile refineries, mobile de-contamination facilities, mobile general and special purpose disaster mortuary facilities such as [[Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team]] (DMORT) and [[DMORT-WMD]], and other aids such as temporary housing to speed civil recovery.\n\nOn an individual scale, one means of preparation for exposure to [[nuclear fallout]] is to obtain [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets as a safety measure to protect the human [[thyroid]] gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive [[iodine]]. Another measure is to cover the nose, mouth and eyes with a piece of cloth and sunglasses to protect against [[alpha particle]]s, which are only an internal hazard.\n\nTo support and supplement efforts at national, regional and local level with regard to disaster prevention, the [[wikt:preparedness|preparedness]] of those responsible for civil protection and the intervention in the event of disaster\n* To establish a framework for effective and rapid cooperation between different civil protection services when mutual assistance is needed (police, [[fire service]], [[healthcare]] service, [[public utility]] [[wikt:provider|provider]], voluntary agencies)\n*To set up and implement training programs for intervention and coordination teams as well as assessment experts including joint courses and exchange systems\n*To enhance the coherence of actions undertaken at international level in the field of civil protection, especially in the context of cooperation\n\nPreparing also includes sharing information:\n*To contribute to informing the public, in view of increasing citizens' level of self-protection\n*To collect and disseminate validated emergency information\n*To pool information on national civil protection capabilities, military and medical resources\n*To ensure efficient information sharing between the different authorities\n\n=== Response ===\nResponse consists first of warning civilians so they can enter [[fallout shelter]]s and protect assets.\n\nStaffing a response is always full of problems in a civil defense emergency. After an attack, conventional full-time emergency services are dramatically overloaded, with conventional fire fighting response times often exceeding several days. Some capability is maintained by local and state agencies, and an emergency reserve is provided by specialised military units, especially [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]], [[Military Police]], [[Judge Advocate]]s and [[combat engineer]]s.\n\nHowever, the traditional response to massed attack on civilian population centres is to maintain a mass-trained force of volunteer emergency workers. Studies in [[World War II]] showed that lightly trained (40 hours or less) civilians in organised teams can perform up to 95% of emergency activities when trained, liaised and supported by local government. In this plan, the populace rescues itself from most situations, and provides information to a central office to prioritize professional emergency services.\n\nIn the 1990s, this concept was revived by the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] to cope with civil emergencies such as [[earthquake]]s. The program was widely adopted, providing standard terms for organization. In the U.S., this is now official federal policy, and it is implemented by [[community emergency response team]]s, under the Department of Homeland Security, which certifies training programmes by local governments, and registers \"certified disaster service workers\" who complete such training.\n\n=== Recovery ===\n\nRecovery consists of rebuilding damaged infrastructure, buildings and production. The recovery phase is the longest and ultimately most expensive phase. Once the immediate \"crisis\" has passed, cooperation fades away and recovery efforts are often politicised or seen as economic opportunities.\n\nPreparation for recovery can be very helpful. If mitigating resources are dispersed before the attack, cascades of social failures can be prevented. One hedge against bridge damage in riverine cities is to subsidise a \"tourist ferry\" that performs scenic cruises on the river. When a bridge is down, the ferry takes up the load.\n\n== Civil defense organizations ==\n[[Image:United States Civil Defense Roundel.svg|right|thumb|The old [[United States civil defense]] logo. The triangle emphasized the 3-step Civil Defense philosophy used before the foundation of FEMA and [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]].]]\nCivil Defense is also the name of a number of organizations around the world dedicated to protecting civilians from military attacks, as well as to providing rescue services after natural and human-made disasters alike.\n\nWorldwide protection is managed by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] ([[OCHA]]).\n\nIn a few countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Singapore]] (see [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]), civil defense is essentially the same organisation {{clarify|date=February 2013}} as the [[fire brigade]]. In most countries, however, civil defense is a government-managed, volunteer-staffed organisation, separate from the fire brigade and the [[ambulance]] service.\n\nAs the threat of Cold War eased, a number of such civil defense organisations have been disbanded or mothballed (as in the case of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States civil defense]]), while others have changed their focuses into providing rescue services after natural disasters (as for the [[State Emergency Service]] in [[Australia]]). However, the ideals of Civil Defense {{clarify|date=February 2013}} have been brought back in the [[United States]] under FEMA's [[Citizen Corps]] and [[Community Emergency Response Team]] (CERT).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] Civil Defence work is carried out by Emergency Responders under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]], with assistance from voluntary groups such as [[RAYNET]], [[Search and Rescue]] Teams and [[4x4 Response]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Civil Defence Ireland|Civil Defence]] is still very much an active organisation and is occasionally called upon for its Auxiliary Fire Service and ambulance/rescue services when emergencies such as [[flash flooding]] occur and require additional manpower. The organisation has units of trained [[firemen]] and [[medical responder]]s based in key areas around the country.\n\n=== By country ===\n{{main|Civil defense by country}}\n* [[Albanian Civil Protection]]\n* [[State Emergency Service]] - [[Australia]]\n* [[Belgian Civil Protection]] - [[Belgium]]\n* Defesa Civil - [[Brazil]]\n* [[Cyprus Civil Defence]]\n* Population Protection - [[Czech Republic]]\n* [[Civil defense in Finland]]\n* [[S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile]] - [[France]]\n* [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] - [[Germany]]\n* [[General Secretariat for Civil Protection]] - [[Greece]]\n* [[Civil Aid Service]] - [[Hong Kong]]\n* [[Civil Defence of India]]-[[India]]\n* [[Civil Defence Harir in Kurdistan]] - [[Iraq]]\n* [[Civil Defence Ireland]]\n* [[Isle of Man Civil Defence Corps]]\n* [[Civil defense in Israel]]\n* [[Protezione Civile]] - [[Italy]]\n* [[Malaysian Civil Defence Department]]\n* Protecci\u00f3n Civil - [[Mexico]]\n* [[Corps des Sapeurs-Pompiers]] - [[Monaco]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompiers.gouv.mc/|title=Corps des sapeurs-pompiers -  Corps des sapeurs-pompiers de Monaco|first=eZ|last=Systems|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Civil Defence (New Zealand)]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/|title=Home \u00bb Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Nigeria security and civil defence corps - [[Nigeria]]\n* [[Norwegian Civil Defence]]\n* [[Panama Civil Defense Seismic Network]]\n* [[Portugal]]- [[Autoridade Nacional de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Civil]]: http://www.prociv.pt\n* [[Civil Police (San Marino)|Civil Police]] - [[San Marino]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/corpimilitari.html|title=Military Organizations - San Marino Site Turismo|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]\n\n'''UK:'''\n* [[Civil Defence Corps]]\n* [[4x4 Response]]\n* [[HANDEL|UK's National Attack Warning System]]\n* [[Royal Observer Corps]]\n\n'''US:'''\n* [[Civil Air Patrol]]\n* [[United States civil defense]]\n* [[United States civil defense association]]\n* [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]]\n* [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]\n* [[CONELRAD]]\n* [[Duck and cover]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The American Civil Defense Association]]\n*[[French Civil Protection]]\n* [[Blast shelter]]\n* [[Civil Defense geiger counters|Civil-defense Geiger counters]]\n* [[Civil defense siren]]\n* [[Collective protection]]\n* [[Continuity of government]]\n* [[Effects of nuclear explosions on human health]]\n* [[Emergency management]]\n* [[Fallout shelter]]\n* [[Transarmament]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[Nuclear warfare]]\n* [[Survivalism]]\n* [[Weapon of mass destruction]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Civil defense}}\n* [http://www.civilprotection.gr Greece]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053551/http://cp-bg.org/snimki/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=10 Large gallery of Bulgaria's Civil Defense Mechanization]<small>(archived link)</small>\n* [http://www.thetimechamber.co.uk/sites/Civil/Civil.php The UK Civil Defence Project - History & Photos]\n* [http://ncdcnagpur.nic.in/ National Civil Defence College, Nagpur INDIA]\n* [http://www.qrz.com/db/AT7CD Special Event Amateur Ham Radio Station operated from Bangalore, INDIA]\n* [http://www.protezionecivile.it/ Protezione Civile] Italian Civil Defense\n* [http://www.dublincivildefence.com/ Dublin Civil Defence] Ireland\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090607080955/http://www.sebev.co.uk/ SEBEV Search and Rescue] (originally a Civil Defence team in the UK)\n* [http://www.proteccioncivil.org Civil Protection] ([[Ministry of Interior]], [[Spain]]).\n* [http://www.proteccioncivilvillena.es Civil Protection Villena - Spain]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/washington/01civil.html Civil Defense Logo dies at 67, and Some Mourn its Passing], ''The New York Times'', 1 December 2006 by David Dunlap.\n* [http://www.civildefensemuseum.com Cold War Era Civil Defense Museum] &ndash;

Trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen by cleaving peptidic bonds in positions Arg15 - Ile16 and produces \u03c0-chymotrypsin. In turn, aminic group (-NH3<sup>+</sup>) of the Ile16 residue interacts with the side chain of Glu194, producing the \"oxyanion hole\" and the hydrophobic \"S1 pocket\". Moreover, chymotrypsin induces its own activation by cleaving in positions 14-15, 146-147, and 148-149, producing \u03b1-chymotrypsin (which is more active and stable than \u03c0-chymotrypsin).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The resulting molecule is a three-[[peptide|polypeptide]] molecule interconnected via [[disulfide bond]]s.\n\n== Mechanism of action and kinetics ==\n{{See also|Catalytic triad}}\n''In vivo'', chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme ([[serine protease]]) acting in the digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a [[hydrolysis]] reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable, occurs extremely slowly in the absence of a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin also hydrolyses amide bonds ''in vitro'', a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.\n[[Image:Mechanism of peptide bond cleavage in \u03b1-chymotrypsin.gif|thumb|left|450px|Mechanism of peptide bond cleavage in &alpha;-chymotrypsin]]\n\nChymotrypsin cleaves peptide bonds by attacking the unreactive carbonyl group with a powerful nucleophile, the [[serine]] 195 residue located in the active site of the enzyme, which briefly becomes covalently bonded to the substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate intermediate. Along with [[histidine]] 57 and [[aspartic acid]] 102, this serine residue constitutes the [[catalytic triad]] of the active site.\n\nThese findings rely on inhibition assays and the study of the kinetics of cleavage of the aforementioned substrate, exploiting the fact that the enzyme-substrate intermediate [[4-Nitrophenol|''p''-nitrophenolate]] has a yellow colour, enabling  measurement of its concentration by measuring light absorbance at 410&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe reaction of chymotrypsin with its substrate was found to take place in two stages, an initial \u201cburst\u201d phase at the beginning of the reaction and a steady-state phase following [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]]. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First, acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate, and then deacylation to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three-amino-acid residues in the catalytic triad.<ref name=Petsko&Ringe>{{cite book|title=Protein Structure and Function |last1=Petsko |first1=Gregory |last2=Ringe |first2=Dagmar |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-955684-7 |pages=78\u201379}}</ref>  Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-\u03b4 hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its \u03b5 nitrogen, thus making it able to deprotonate serine. This deprotonation allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed carboxyl terminus <ref name=Petsko&Ringe />\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Isozymes ==\n\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{infobox protein\n| Name = Chymotrypsinogen B1\n| caption = \n| image = \n| width = 150 px\n| HGNCid = 2521\n| Symbol = CTRB1\n| AltSymbols =\n| EntrezGene = 1504\n| OMIM = 118890\n| RefSeq = NM_001906\n| UniProt = P17538\n| PDB = \n| MEROPS = S01.152\n| ECnumber = 3.4.21.1\n| Chromosome = 16\n| Arm = q\n| Band = 23.1\n| LocusSupplementaryData = \n}}\n|{{infobox protein\n| Name = Chymotrypsinogen B2\n| caption = \n| image = \n| width = \n| HGNCid = 2522\n| Symbol = CTRB2\n| AltSymbols = \n| EntrezGene = 440387\n| OMIM = \n| RefSeq = NM_001025200\n| UniProt = Q6GPI1\n| PDB = \n| ECnumber = 3.4.21.1\n| Chromosome = 16\n| Arm = q\n| Band = 22.3\n| LocusSupplementaryData = \n}}\n|{{infobox protein\n| Name = [[Chymotrypsin-C|Chymotrypsin C (caldecrin)]]\n| caption = \n| image = \n| width = \n| HGNCid = 2523\n| Symbol = [[Chymotrypsin-C|CTRC]]\n| AltSymbols = \n| EntrezGene = 11330\n| OMIM = 601405\n| RefSeq = NM_007272\n| UniProt = Q99895\n| MEROPS = S01.157\n| PDB = \n| ECnumber = 3.4.21.2\n| Chromosome = 1\n| Arm = p\n| Band = 36.21\n| LocusSupplementaryData = \n}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Trypsin]]\n*[[PA clan]] of proteases\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = | language = | publisher = W.H.

The CERT concept differs because it includes nonmilitary emergencies, and is coordinated with all levels of emergency authorities, local to national, via an overarching [[incident command system]].\n<!-- basic training in [[disaster]] [[preparedness]], the [[incident command system]], disaster [[fire suppression]], basic disaster [[medical]] operations, light [[search and rescue]], and team operations. -->\n\n== Organization ==\nA [[local government]] agency, often a [[fire department]], [[police department]], or [[emergency management]] agency, agrees to sponsor CERT within its jurisdiction. The sponsoring agency liaises with, deploys and may train or supervise the training of CERT members. Many sponsoring agencies employ a full-time community-service person as liaison to the CERT members. In some communities, the liaison is a volunteer and CERT member.\n\nAs people are trained and agree to join the community emergency response effort, a CERT is formed. Initial efforts may result in a team with only a few members from across the community. As the number of members grow, a single community-wide team may subdivide. Multiple CERTs are organized into a hierarchy of teams consistent with [[Incident Command System|ICS]] principles. This follows the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) principle of [[Span of control]] until the ideal distribution is achieved: one or more teams are formed at each neighborhood within a community.\n\nA '''Teen Community Emergency Response Team''' ('''TEEN CERT'''), or '''Student Emergency Response Team''' ('''SERT'''), can be formed from any group of teens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridadisaster.org/citizencorps/TeenCert/documents/0209%20Teen%20CERT%20Workbook.pdf |title=Teen CERT: Disaster Teen Training Guide |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=floridadisaster.org |publisher=Volunteer USA Foundation |access-date=17 July 2015 |quote=}}</ref> A Teen CERT can be formed as a school club, service organization, [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] Crew, [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Explorer]] Post, or the training can be added to a school's graduation curriculum. Some CERTs form a club or service corporation, and recruit volunteers to perform training on behalf of the sponsoring agency. This reduces the financial and human resource burden on the sponsoring agency.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 7756 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A CERT volunteer practices using a fire extinguisher.]]\n\nWhen not responding to disasters or large emergencies, CERTs may\n* raise funds for emergency response equipment in their community;\n* provide first-aid, crowd control or other services at community events;\n* hold planning, training, or recruitment meetings; and\n* conduct or participate in disaster response exercises.\n\nSome sponsoring agencies use state and federal grants to purchase response tools and equipment for their members and team(s) (subject to Stafford Act limitations). Most CERTs also acquire their own supplies, tools, and equipment. As community members, CERTs are aware of the specific needs of their community and equip the teams accordingly.\n\n== Response ==\nThe basic idea is to use CERT to perform the large number of tasks needed in emergencies. This frees highly trained professional responders for more technical tasks. Much of CERT training concerns the Incident Command System and organization, so CERT members fit easily into larger command structures.\n\nA team may self-activate (self-deploy) when their own neighborhood is affected by disaster. An effort is made to report their response status to the sponsoring agency. A self-activated team will size-up the loss in their neighborhood and begin performing the skills they have learned to minimize further loss of life, property, and environment. They will continue to respond safely until redirected or relieved by the sponsoring agency or professional responders on-scene.\n\nTeams in neighborhoods not affected by disaster may be deployed or activated by the sponsoring agency. The sponsoring agency may communicate with neighborhood CERT leaders through an [[Organic (military)|organic]] communication team. In some areas the communications may be by [[amateur radio]], [[Family Radio Service|FRS]], [[GMRS]] or [[Multi-Use Radio Service|MURS]] radio, dedicated telephone or fire-alarm networks. In other areas, relays of bicycle-equipped runners can effectively carry messages between the teams and the local emergency operations center.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 7746 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|250px|CERT volunteers try on their equipment.]]\n\nThe sponsoring agency may activate and dispatch teams in order to gather or respond to intelligence about an incident. Teams may be dispatched to affected neighborhoods, or organized to support operations. CERT members may augment support staff at an [[Incident Command Post]] or [[Emergency Operations Center]]. Additional teams may also be created to guard a morgue, locate supplies and food, convey messages to and from other CERTs and local authorities, and other duties on an as-needed basis as identified by the team leader.\n\nIn the short term, CERTs perform data gathering, especially to locate mass-casualties requiring professional response, or situations requiring professional rescues, simple fire-fighting tasks (for example, small fires, turning off gas), light search and rescue, damage evaluation of structures, [[triage]] and [[first aid]]. In the longer term, CERTs may assist in the evacuation of residents, or assist with setting up a neighborhood shelter.\n\nWhile responding, CERT members are temporary volunteer government workers. In some areas, (such as [[California]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Kansas]]) registered, activated CERT members are eligible for worker's compensation for on-the-job injuries during declared disasters.\n\n== Member roles ==\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that the standard, ten-person team be comprised as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewoodlandstownship-tx.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1551 |title=Standing Operating Procedures |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Woodlands CERT Committee |access-date=17 July 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n* '''CERT Leader'''. Generally, the first CERT team member arriving on the scene becomes team leader, and is the designated Incident Commander (IC) until the arrival of someone more competent. This person makes the IC initial assessment of the scene and determines the appropriate course of action for team members; assumes role of Safety Officer until assigned to another team member; assigns team member roles if not already assigned; designates triage area, treatment area, morgue, and vehicle traffic routes; coordinates and directs team operations; determines logistical needs (water, food, medical supplies, transportation, equipment, and so on.) and determines ways to meet those needs through team members or citizen volunteers on the scene; collects and writes reports on the operation and victims; and communicates and coordinates with the incident commander, local authorities, and other CERT team leaders. The team leader is identified by two pieces of crossed tape on the hard hat.\n* '''Safety Officer'''. Checks team members prior to deployment to ensure they are safe and equipped for the operation; determines safe or unsafe working environments; ensures team accountability; supervises operations (when possible) where team members and victims are at direct physical risk, and alerts team members when unsafe conditions arise.\n* '''Fire Suppression Team (2 people)'''. Work under the supervision of the Team Leader to suppress small fires in designated work areas or as needed; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the search and rescue team or triage team; assist in evacuation and transport as needed; assist in the triage or treatment area as needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.\n* '''Search and Rescue Team (2)'''. Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, searching for and providing rescue of victims as is prudent under the conditions; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team, assist in the triage or treatment area as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.\n* '''Medical Triage Team (2)'''. Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing [[simple triage and rapid treatment|START]] triage for victims found at the scene; marking victims with category of injury per the standard operating procedures; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team if needed, assist the Search and Rescue Team if needed, assist in the Medical Triage Area if needed, assist in the Treatment Area if needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.\n\n[[File:Springfield CERT Truck (1708475192).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An equipment trailer belonging to the Springfield, Illinois CERT program.]]\n\n* '''Medical Treatment Team (2)'''. Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing medical treatment to victims within the scope of their training. This task is normally accomplished in the Treatment Area, however, it may take place in the affected area as well. When not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team as needed, assist the Medical Triage Team as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with the Team Leader.\n\nBecause every CERT member in a community receives the same core instruction, any team member has the training necessary to assume any of these roles. This is important during a disaster response because not all members of a regular team may be available to respond. Hasty teams may be formed by whichever members are responding at the time. Additionally, members may need to adjust team roles due to stress, fatigue, injury, or other circumstances.\n\n== Training ==\n[[File:Feb 5 2017 CERT C.jpg|thumb|On February 5, 2017, Community Emergency Response team training in Berwyn Heights, Maryland with two members putting out a fire.]]\n[[File:Feb 5 2017 CERT D.jpg|thumb|On February 5, 2017, Community Emergency Response team training while in gear.]]\nWhile state and local jurisdictions will implement training in the manner that best suits the community, FEMA's National CERT Program has an established curriculum. Jurisdictions may augment the training, but are strongly encouraged to deliver the entire core content. The CERT core curriculum for the basic course is composed of the following nine units (time is instructional hours):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/pdf/efop/efo45561.pdf |title=A Community Emergency Response Team in the Marshfield Fire and Rescue Department |last1=Schmidt |first1=James B. |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=U.S. Fire Administration |access-date=17 July 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n* '''Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness''' (2.5 hrs). Topics include (in part) identifying local disaster threats, disaster impact, mitigation and preparedness concepts, and an overview of Citizen Corps and CERT. Hands on skills include [[team-building]] exercises, and shutting off utilities.\n* '''Unit 2: Fire Safety''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn about fire chemistry, mitigation practices, [[hazardous materials]] identification, suppression options, and are introduced to the concept of size-up. Hands-on skills include using a [[fire extinguisher]] to suppress a live flame, and wearing basic protective gear. Firefighting standpipes as well as unconventional firefighting methods are also covered.\n* '''Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations part 1''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn to identify and treat certain life-threatening conditions in a disaster setting, as well as [[START triage]]. Hands-on skills include performing head-tilt/chin-lift, practicing bleeding control techniques, and performing triage as an exercise.\n* '''Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations part 2''' (2.5 hrs). Topics cover mass casualty operations, public health, assessing patients, and treating injuries. Students practice patient assessment, and various treatment techniques.\n* '''Unit 5: Light Search and Rescue Operations''' (2.5 hrs). Size-up is expanded as students learn about assessing structural damage, marking structures that have been searched, search techniques, as well as rescue techniques and [[Cribbing (rescue)|cribbing]]. Hands-on activities include lifting and cribbing an object, and practicing rescue carries.\n* '''Unit 6: CERT Organization''' (1.5 hrs). Students are introduced to several concepts from the Incident Command System, and local team organization and communication is explained. Hands-on skills include a table-top exercise focusing on incident command and control.\n* '''Unit 7: Disaster Psychology''' (1 hr). Responder [[critical incident stress management|well-being]] and dealing with victim [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] are the topics of this unit.\n* '''Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn how [[terrorism|terrorists]] may choose targets, what weapons they may use, and identifying when [[CBRNE|chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive]] weapons may have been deployed. Students learn about CERT roles in preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks. A table-top exercise highlights topics covered.\n* '''Unit 9: Course Review and Disaster Simulation''' (2.5 hrs). Students take a written exam, then participate in a real-time practical disaster simulation where the different skill areas are put to the test. A critique follows the exercise where students and instructors have an opportunity to learn from mistakes and highlight exemplary actions. Students may be given a certificate of completion at the conclusion of the course.\n\nCERT training emphasizes safely \"doing the most good for the most people as quickly as possible\" when responding to a disaster. For this reason, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) training is not included in the core curriculum, as it is time and responder intensive in a [[mass-casualty incident]]. However, many jurisdictions encourage or require CERT members to obtain CPR training.  Many CERT programs provide or encourage members to take additional [[first aid]] training. Some CERT members may also take training to become a [[certified first responder]] or [[emergency medical technician]].\n\n[[File:Cert ecc (7643874586).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arlington Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) provided back-up support to the county's 911 system.]]\n\nMany CERT programs also provide training in [[amateur radio]] operation, shelter operations, flood response, community relations, mass care, the [[incident command system]] (ICS), and the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).\n\nEach unit of CERT training is ideally delivered by professional responders or other experts in the field addressed by the unit. This is done to help build unity between CERT members and responders, keep the attention of students, and help the professional response organizations be comfortable with the training which CERT members receive.\n\nEach course of instruction is ideally facilitated by one or more instructors certified in the CERT curriculum by the state or sponsoring agency. Facilitating instructors provide continuity between units, and help ensure that the CERT core curriculum is being delivered successfully. Facilitating instructors also perform set-up and tear-down of the classroom, provide instructional materials for the course, record student attendance and other tasks which assist the professional responder in delivering their unit as efficiently as possible.\n\nCERT training is provided free to interested members of the community, and is delivered in a group classroom setting. People may complete the training without obligation to join a CERT. Citizen Corps grant funds can be used to print and provide each student with a printed manual. Some sponsoring agencies use Citizen Corps grant funds to purchase disaster response tool kits. These kits are offered as an incentive to join a CERT, and must be returned to the sponsoring agency when members resign from CERT.\n\nSome sponsoring agencies require a criminal background-check of all trainees before allowing them to participate on a CERT. For example, the city of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] require all volunteers to pass a background check,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cabq.gov/emergency-management-office/citizen-preparedness/community-emergency-response-team |title=Community Emergency Response Team |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=City of Albuquerque Official Website |publisher= |access-date=17 July 2015 |quote=}}</ref> while the city of [[Austin, Texas]] does not require a background check to take part in training classes but requires members to undergo a background check in order to receive a CERT badge and directly assist first responders during an activation of the [[Emergency Operations Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://austintexas.gov/AustinCERT |title=CERT Volunteers |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=City of Austin Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management |access-date=17 July 2015 |quote=}}</ref> However, most programs do not require a criminal background check in order to participate.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 7743 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|250px|CERT volunteers during the classroom portion of their training.]]\n\nThe CERT curriculum (including the Train-the-Trainer and Program Manager courses) was updated during the last half of 2017 to reflect feedback from instructors across the nation.

The most commonly used ammunition were stones, but \"darts and sharp wooden poles\" could be substituted if necessary. The most effective kind of ammunition though involved fire, such as \"firebrands, and deadly [[Greek Fire]]\". Trebuchets came in two different designs: Traction, which were powered by people, or Counterpoise, where the people were replaced with \"a weight on the short end\".<ref name= \"Middle Ages\"/>  The most famous historical account of trebuchet use dates back to the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, when the army of Edward I constructed a giant trebuchet known as [[Warwolf]], which then proceeded to \"level a section of [castle] wall, successfully concluding the siege\".<ref name=\"catapults.info\" />\n\n; [[Trebuchet|Couillard]]: A simplified trebuchet, where the trebuchet's single counterweight is split, swinging on either side of a central support post.\n\n; Leonardo da Vinci's catapult: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought to improve the efficiency and range of earlier designs. His design incorporated a large wooden [[leaf spring]] as an [[:wikt:accumulator|accumulator]] to power the catapult.{{citation needed |date=February 2011}} Both ends of the bow are connected by a rope, similar to the design of a [[bow and arrow]]. The leaf spring was not used to pull the catapult armature directly, rather the rope was wound around a drum. The catapult armature was attached to this drum which would be turned until enough potential energy was stored in the deformation of the spring. The drum would then be disengaged from the winding mechanism, and the catapult arm would snap around.{{citation needed | date = February 2011}} Though no records exist of this design being built during Leonardo's lifetime, contemporary enthusiasts have reconstructed it.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n== Modern use ==\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:French grenade catapult.jpg|left|thumb|200px|French troops using a catapult to throw [[hand grenade]]s and other explosives during [[World War I]]]]\nThe last large scale military use of catapults was during the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. During the early stages of the war, catapults were used to throw [[hand grenade]]s across [[no man's land]] into enemy trenches. They were eventually replaced by small [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].\n\nIn the 1840s the invention of [[vulcanized]] [[natural rubber|rubber]] allowed the making of small hand-held catapults, either improvised from Y-shaped sticks or manufactured for sale; both were popular with children and teenagers. These devices were also known as [[slingshots]] in the USA.\n\nSpecial variants called [[aircraft catapult]]s are used to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a powered takeoff or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines.{{dubious|date=June 2016}} Small catapults, referred to as \"traps\", are still widely used to launch [[clay target]]s into the air in the sport of [[clay pigeon shooting]].\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nIn the 1990s and into the early 2000s, a powerful catapult, a trebuchet, was used by thrill-seekers first on private property and in 2001-2002 at Middlemoor Water Park, Somerset, England to experience being catapulted through the air for {{convert|100|ft|m|sp=us}}. The practice has been discontinued due a fatality at the Water Park. There had been an injury when the trebuchet was in use on private property.

Then Crapsey decided to make the criterion a stanza of five lines of accentual-syllabic verse, in which the lines comprise, in order, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1 stresses and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 2 syllables. Iambic feet were meant to be the standard for the cinquain, which made the dual criteria match perfectly.

It is an informal cinquain widely taught in elementary schools and has been featured in, and popularized by, children's media resources, including [[Junie B. Jones]] and [[PBS Kids]]. This form is also embraced by young adults and older poets for its expressive simplicity.  The prescriptions of this type of cinquain refer to word count, not syllables and stresses.  Ordinarily, the first line is a one-word title, the subject of the poem; the second line is a pair of adjectives describing that title; the third line is a three-word phrase that gives more information about the subject (often a list of three [[gerund]]s); the fourth line consists of four words describing feelings related to that subject; and the fifth line is a single word synonym or other reference for the subject from line one.<br />\n<br />\nFor example:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSnow<br />\nSilent, white<br />\nDancing, falling, drifting<br />\nCovering everything it touches<br />\nBlanket\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other cinquains==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Form\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Tanka]]\n|is a five-line form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, totalling 31 [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.\n|-\n|Tetractys\n|is a five-line poem of 20 syllables with a title, arranged in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, with each line standing as a phrase on its own.

The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but that had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and Atiu for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionaries. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands|publisher=Ck|date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>\n\n====Weaving====\nThe outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells that are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern islands, Manihiki, Rakahanga and Penrhyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands |publisher=Ck |date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>\n\n====Tivaevae====\nA major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]].

In 1901, the islands were included within the boundaries of the [[Colony of New Zealand]].\n\nThe Cook Islands contain 15 islands in the group spread over a vast area in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. The majority of islands are low coral atolls in the Northern Group, with [[Rarotonga]], a volcanic island in the Southern Group, as the main administration and government centre. The main Cook Islands language is [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan M\u0101ori]]. There are some variations in dialect in the 'outer' islands.\n\n==Early Settlers of the Cooks ==\nIt is thought that the Cook Islands may have been settled between the years 900 - 1200 AD. Early settlements suggest that the settlers were generally great warriors migrating from Tahiti, to the north east of the Cooks. The Cook Islands continue to hold important connections with Tahiti, and this is generally found in the two countries' culture, tradition and language. It is also thought that the early settlers were true Tahitians, who landed in Rarotonga (Takitumu city). There are notable historic epics of great warriors that travel between the two nations for a wide variety of reasons. The purpose of these missions is still unclear but recent research indicate that large to small groups often fled their island due to local wars being forced upon them. For each group to travel and to survive, they would normally rely on a warrior to lead them. Outstanding warriors are still mentioned in the countries' traditions and stories.\n\nThese arrivals are evidenced by an older road in Toi, the ''Ara Metua'', which runs around most of Rarotonga, and is believed to be at least 1200 years old. This 29&nbsp;km long, paved road is a considerable achievement of ancient engineering, possibly unsurpassed elsewhere in Polynesia.<ref name=\"wondermondo\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NZ/Cook/AraMetua.htm|title=Ara Metua - ancient Polynesian road|publisher=Wondermondo}}</ref> The islands of Manihiki and Rakahanga trace their origins to the arrival of Toa, an outcast from Rarotonga, and Tupaeru, a high-ranking woman from the Puaikura tribe of Rarotonga.

Portuguese-Spaniard [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quir\u00f3s]] made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/rakahang.htm|title=Rakahanga - Island of Beautiful People|publisher=www.ck}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/rarotonga-and-the-cook-islands/history#269027|title=History of Rarotonga & the Cook Islands: European explorers|publisher=Lonely Planet}}</ref>\n\nBritish navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777. Cook named the islands the 'Hervey Islands' to honour a British Lord of the Admiralty. Half a century later the Russian [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] published the ''Atlas de l'Ocean Pacifique'', in which he renamed the islands the Cook Islands to honour Cook. [[Captain Cook]] navigated and mapped much of the group. Surprisingly, Cook never sighted the largest island, [[Rarotonga]], and the only island that he personally set foot on was tiny, uninhabited [[Palmerston Island|Palmerston Atoll]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga & the Cook Islands|author=Errol Hunt & Nancy J.

Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and remains the predominant religion today.\n\nIn 1823, [[Captain John Dibbs]] of the colonial barque Endeavour made the first official sighting of the island [[Rarotonga]]. The Endeavour was transporting Rev. [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] on a missionary voyage to the islands.\n\nBrutal [[Peruvian]] [[slave traders]], known as [[blackbirding|blackbirders]], took a terrible toll on the islands of the Northern Group in 1862 and 1863. At first the traders may have genuinely operated as labour recruiters, but they quickly turned to subterfuge and outright kidnapping to round up their human cargo. The [[Cook Islands]] was not the only island group visited by the traders, but [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn Atoll]] was their first port of call and it has been estimated that three-quarters of the population was taken to [[Callao]], [[Peru]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Discoverers Of The Cook Islands And The Names They Gave|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-KloDisc-t1-body-d10.html|date=1976|author=Alphons M.J.

The [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Queen's Representative]], is the [[Head of State]]; the prime minister is the [[head of government]] and of a  [[multi-party system]]. The Islands are self-governing in free association with [[New Zealand]] and are fully responsible for internal affairs. New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent years, the Cook Islands have taken on more of its own external affairs; as of 2005, it has diplomatic relations in its own name with eighteen other countries. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and [[Parliament of the Cook Islands|the islands' parliament]].  The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislatures.\n\n==Constitution==\nThe [[Constitution of the Cook Islands]] took effect on August 4, 1965, when the Cook Islands became a [[Self-government|self-governing]] territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand. The anniversary of these events in 1965 is commemorated annually on [[Constitution Day]], with week long activities known as ''Te Maeva Nui Celebrations'' locally.\n\n== Executive ==\n{{office-table}}\n| Queen || [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Elizabeth II]] || || 6 February 1952</tr>\n| Queen's Representative || [[Tom Marsters]] || || 27 July 2013</tr>\n| [[Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Prime Minister]] || [[Henry Puna]] || [[Cook Islands Party|CIP]] || 30 November 2010</tr>\n|}\nThe monarch is hereditary; her representative is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the Cook Islands Government. The cabinet is chosen by the prime minister and collectively responsible to Parliament.\n\nTen years of rule by the Cook Islands Party (CIP) came to an end 18 November 1999 with the resignation of Prime Minister Joe Williams. Williams had led a minority government since October 1999 when the New Alliance Party (NAP) left the government coalition and joined the main opposition [[Democratic Alliance Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]] (DAP). On 18 November 1999, DAP leader Dr. Terepai Maoate was sworn in as prime minister. He was succeeded by his co-partisan [[Robert Woonton]]. When Dr Woonton lost his seat in the 2004 elections, [[Jim Marurai]] took over. In the 2010 elections, the CIP regained power and [[Henry Puna]] was sworn in as prime minister on 30 November 2010.\n\nFollowing uncertainty about the ability of the government to maintain its majority, the Queen's representative dissolved parliament midway through its term and a 'snap' election was held on 26 September 2006. Jim Marurai's Democratic Party retained the Treasury benches with an increased majority.\n\nThe New Zealand High Commissioner is appointed by the New Zealand Government.\n\n== Legislature ==\n[[Image:Parliament of the Cook Islands - 2006.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The parliament building of the Cook Islands, formerly a hotel.]]\nThe [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]] has 24 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. There is also a [[House of Ariki]], composed of [[ali'i|chiefs]], which has a purely advisory role. The [[Koutu Nui]] is a similar organization consisting of sub-chiefs. It was established by an amendment in 1972 of the 1966 House of Ariki Act. The current president is [[Te Tika Mataiapo Dorice Reid]].\n\nOn June 13, 2008, a small majority of members of the House of Ariki attempted a coup, claiming to dissolve the elected government and to take control of the country's leadership. \"Basically we are dissolving the leadership, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and the ministers,\" chief Makea Vakatini Joseph Ariki explained.

Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts.\n\nTrade deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly from [[New Zealand]]. Efforts to exploit tourism potential, encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment and growth.\n\n== Banking and finance ==\nThe Cook Islands has \"Home Rule\" with respect to banking, similar to [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nThis \"Home Rule\" banking confuses New Zealanders on vacation in the Cooks. Cook [[automated teller machine]]s often fail to fully disclose the fact that the Cooks are not part of the New Zealand banking system, thus legally requiring banks to charge the same fees for withdrawing or transferring money as if the person was in Australia or the EU. The New Zealand dollar is the official currency of the Cook Islands, adding to the confusion.

Casey, et al. ''Punched Cards: Their Applications to Science and Industry''. 1952.</ref>\n\nIn early use, the underlying hardware, rather than the contents stored on it, was denominated a \"file\". For example, the [[IBM 350]] disk drives were denominated \"disk files\".<ref>Martin H. Weik. Ballistic Research Laboratories Report #1115. March 1961. [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-ibm03.html#IBM-305-RAMAC pp. 314-331].</ref> The introduction, circa 1961, by the [[Burroughs MCP]] and the MIT [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] of the concept of a \"[[file system]]\" that managed several virtual \"files\" on one storage device is the origin of the contemporary denotation of the word. Although the contemporary \"[[register file]]\" demonstrates the early concept of files, its use has greatly decreased.\n\n==File contents==\nOn most modern [[operating system]]s, files are organized into one-dimensional arrays of [[byte]]s. The [[file format|format]] of a file is defined by its content since a file is solely a container for data, although, on some platforms the format is usually indicated by its [[filename extension]], specifying the rules for how the bytes must be organized and interpreted meaningfully. For example, the bytes of a plain text file (<tt>.txt</tt> in Windows) are associated with either [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]] characters, while the bytes of image, video, and audio files are interpreted otherwise. Most file types also allocate a few bytes for [[metadata]], which allows a file to carry some basic information about itself.\n\nSome file systems can store arbitrary (not interpreted by the file system) file-specific data outside of the file format, but linked to the file, for example [[extended attributes]] or [[Fork (file system)|forks]]. On other file systems this can be done via [[sidecar file]]s or software-specific databases. All those methods, however, are more susceptible to loss of metadata than are [[Digital container format|container]] and [[archive file]] formats.\n\n=== File size ===\n{{Main article | File size}}\nAt any instant in time, a file might have a size, normally expressed as number of [[byte]]s, that indicates how much storage is associated with the file. In most modern operating systems the size can be any non-negative whole number of bytes up to a system limit. Many older operating systems kept track only of the number of [[disk sector|blocks]] or [[track (disk drive)|tracks]] occupied by a file on a physical storage device. In such systems, software employed other methods to track the exact byte count (e.g., [[CP/M]] used a special control character, [[Ctrl-Z]], to signal the end of text files).\n\nThe general definition of a file does not require that its size have any real meaning, however, unless the data within the file happens to correspond to data within a pool of persistent storage. A special case is a [[zero byte file]]; these files can be newly created files that have not yet had any data written to them, or may serve as some kind of [[Flag (computing)|flag]] in the file system, or are accidents (the results of aborted disk operations). For example, the file to which the link <tt>/bin/ls</tt> points in a typical [[Unix-like]] system probably has a defined size that seldom changes. Compare this with <tt>[[/dev/null]]</tt> which is also a file, but its size may be obscure.  (This is misleading because /dev/null is not really a file: in Unix-like systems, all resources, including devices, are accessed like files, but there is still a real distinction between files and devices\u2014at core, they behave differently\u2014and the obscurity of the \"size\" of /dev/null is one manifestation of this.  As a character device, /dev/null ''has'' no size.)\n\n=== Organization of data in a file ===\nInformation in a computer file can consist of smaller packets of information (often called \"[[Row (database)|records]]\" or \"lines\") that are individually different but share some common traits. For example, a payroll file might contain information concerning all the employees in a company and their payroll details; each record in the payroll file concerns just one employee, and all the records have the common trait of being related to payroll\u2014this is very similar to placing all payroll information into a specific filing cabinet in an office that does not have a computer. A text file may contain lines of text, corresponding to printed lines on a piece of paper. Alternatively, a file may contain an arbitrary binary image (a [[Blob (computing)|BLOB]]) or it may contain an [[executable]].\n\nThe way information is grouped into a file is entirely up to how it is designed. This has led to a plethora of more or less standardized file structures for all imaginable purposes, from the simplest to the most complex. Most computer files are used by [[Computer program|computer programs]] which create, modify or delete the files for their own use on an as-needed basis. The programmers who create the programs decide what files are needed, how they are to be used and (often) their names.\n\nIn some cases, computer programs manipulate files that are made visible to the computer user. For example, in a [[Word processor|word-processing program]], the user manipulates document files that the user personally names. Although the content of the document file is arranged in a format that the word-processing program understands, the user is able to choose the name and location of the file and provide the bulk of the information (such as words and text) that will be stored in the file.\n\nMany applications pack all their data files into a single file called an [[archive file]], using internal markers to discern the different types of information contained within. The benefits of the archive file are to lower the number of files for easier transfer, to reduce storage usage, or just to organize outdated files. The archive file must often be unpacked before next using.\n\n=== Operations ===\nThe most basic operations that programs can perform on a file are:\n* Create<!--needs a link--> a new file\n* Change the [[file system permissions|access permissions]] and [[file attribute|attributes]] of a file\n* [[open (system call)|Open]] a file, which makes the file contents available to the program\n* [[read (system call)|Read]] data from a file\n* [[write (system call)|Write]] data to a file\n* [[close (system call)|Close]] a file, terminating the association between it and the program\n\nFiles on a computer can be created, moved, modified, grown, shrunk, and deleted. In most cases, computer programs that are executed on the computer handle these operations, but the user of a computer can also manipulate files if necessary. For instance, [[Microsoft Word]] files are normally created and modified by the Microsoft Word program in response to user commands, but the user can also move, [[rename (computing)|rename]], or [[File deletion|delete]] these files directly by using a [[file manager|file manager program]] such as [[Windows Explorer]] (on Windows computers) or by [[command-line interface|command lines]] (CLI).\n\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, [[user space]] programs do not operate directly, at a low level, on a file. Only the [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] deals with files, and it handles all user-space interaction with files in a manner that is transparent to the user-space programs. The [[operating system]] provides a level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], which means that interaction with a file from user-space is simply through its filename (instead of its [[file descriptor]]).  For example, <kbd>[[rm (Unix)|rm]] ''filename''</kbd> will not delete the file itself, but only a [[hard link|link]] to the file. There can be many links to a file, but when they are all removed, the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] considers that file's memory space free to be reallocated.  This [[Data remanence|free space]] is commonly considered a security risk (due to the existence of [[File recovery|file recovery software]]). Any secure-deletion program uses kernel-space (system) functions to wipe the file's data.\n\n==Identifying and organizing==\n[[File:FileFolders.svg|thumb|200px|right|Files and folders arranged in a hierarchy]]\nIn modern computer systems, files are typically accessed using names ([[filename]]s).  In some operating systems, the name is associated with the file itself. In others, the file is anonymous, and is pointed to by links that have names. In the latter case, a user can identify the name of the link with the file itself, but this is a false analogue, especially where there exists more than one link to the same file.\n\nFiles (or links to files) can be located in directories. However, more generally, a [[File directory|directory]] can contain either a list of files or a list of links to files.  Within this definition, it is of paramount importance that the term \"file\" includes directories.  This permits the existence of directory hierarchies, i.e., directories containing sub-directories.  A name that refers to a file within a directory must be typically unique. In other words, there must be no identical names within a directory.  However, in some operating systems, a name may include a specification of type that means a directory can contain an identical name for more than one type of object such as a directory and a file.\n\nIn environments in which a file is named, a file's name and the path to the file's directory must uniquely identify it among all other files in the computer system\u2014no two files can have the same name and path.  Where a file is anonymous, named references to it will exist within a namespace.  In most cases, any name within the namespace will refer to exactly zero or one file.  However, any file may be represented within any namespace by zero, one or more names.\n\nAny string of characters may or may not be a well-formed<!-- Could this be a misuse of a term? --> name for a file or a link depending upon the context of application. Whether or not a name is well-formed depends on the type of computer system being used. Early computers<!-- software? --> permitted only a few letters or digits in the name of a file, but modern computers allow long names (some up to 255 characters) containing almost any combination of [[unicode]] letters or unicode digits, making it easier to understand the purpose of a file at a glance. Some computer systems allow file names to contain spaces; others do not. Case-sensitivity of file names is determined by the [[file system]]. Unix file systems are usually case sensitive and allow user-level applications to create files whose names differ only in the case of characters. [[Microsoft Windows]] supports multiple<!-- after Unix, this could be \"only a few\" ;) --> file systems, each with different policies{{which|date=February 2014}} regarding case-sensitivity. The common [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system can have multiple files whose names differ only in case if the user uses a [[disk editor]] to edit the file names in the [[FAT directory table|directory entries]]. User applications, however, will usually not allow the user to create multiple files with the same name but differing in case.\n\nMost computers organize files into hierarchies using folders, directories, or catalogs. The concept is the same irrespective of the terminology used. Each folder can contain an arbitrary number of files, and it can also contain other folders. These other folders are referred to as subfolders. Subfolders can contain still more files and folders and so on, thus building a tree-like structure in which one \"master folder\" (or \"root folder\" \u2014 the name varies from one operating system to another) can contain any number of levels of other folders and files. Folders can be named just as files can (except for the root folder, which often does not have a name). The use of folders makes it easier to organize files in a logical way.\n\nWhen a computer allows the use of folders, each file and folder has not only a name of its own, but also a path, which identifies the folder or folders in which a file or folder resides. In the path, some sort of special character\u2014such as a slash\u2014is used to separate the file and folder names. For example, in the illustration shown in this article, the path <tt>/Payroll/Salaries/Managers</tt> uniquely identifies a file called <tt>Managers</tt> in a folder called <tt>Salaries</tt>, which in turn is contained in a folder called <tt>Payroll</tt>. The folder and file names are separated by slashes in this example; the topmost or root folder has no name, and so the path begins with a slash (if the root folder had a name, it would precede this first slash).\n\nMany (but not all) computer systems use [[filename extension|extensions]] in file names to help identify what they contain, also known as the file type. On Windows computers, extensions consist of a dot (period) at the end of a file name, followed by a few letters to identify the type of file. An extension of <tt>.txt</tt> identifies a text file; a <tt>.doc</tt> extension identifies any type of document or documentation, commonly in the [[Microsoft Word]] [[file format]]; [[List of file formats|and so on]]. Even when extensions are used in a computer system, the degree to which the computer system recognizes and heeds them can vary; in some systems, they are required, while in other systems, they are completely ignored if they are presented.\n\n==Protection==\nMany modern computer systems provide methods for protecting files against accidental and deliberate damage. Computers that allow for multiple users implement [[file permissions]] to control who may or may not modify, delete, or create files and folders. For example, a given user may be granted only permission to read a file or folder, but not to modify or delete it; or a user may be given permission to read and modify files or folders, but not to execute them. Permissions may also be used to allow only certain users to see the contents of a file or folder. Permissions protect against unauthorized tampering or destruction of information in files, and keep private information confidential from unauthorized users.\n\nAnother protection mechanism implemented in many computers is a ''read-only flag.'' When this flag is turned on for a file (which can be accomplished by a computer program or by a human user), the file can be examined, but it cannot be modified. This flag is useful for critical information that must not be modified or erased, such as special files that are used only by internal parts of the computer system. Some systems also include a ''[[Hidden file and hidden directory|hidden flag]]'' to make certain files invisible; this flag is used by the computer system to hide essential system files that users should not alter.\n\n==Storage==\nAny file that has any useful purpose, must have some physical manifestation. That is, a file (an abstract concept) in a real computer system must have a real physical analogue if it is to exist at all.\n\nIn physical terms, most computer files are stored on some type of data storage device. For example, most [[operating system]]s store files on a [[hard disk]]. Hard disks have been the ubiquitous form of [[non-volatile]] storage since the early 1960s.<ref name=\"Mee\">Magnetic Storage Handbook 2nd Ed., Section 2.1.1, Disk File Technology, Mee and Daniel, (c)1990,</ref> Where files contain only temporary information, they may be stored in [[RAM]]. Computer files can be also stored on other media in some cases, such as [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact disc]]s, [[Digital Versatile Disc]]s, [[Zip drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, etc. The use of [[solid state drives]] is also beginning to rival the hard disk drive.\n\nIn Unix-like operating systems, many files have no associated physical storage device. Examples are <tt>[[/dev/null]]</tt> and most files under directories <tt>/dev</tt>, <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt>.  These are virtual files: they exist as objects within the operating system kernel.\n\nAs seen by a running user program, files are usually represented either by a [[File Control Block|File control block]] or by a [[file handle]]. A File control block (FCB) is an area of memory which is manipulated to establish a filename ''etc''. and then passed to the operating system as a parameter, it was used by older IBM operating systems and early PC operating systems including [[CP/M]] and early versions of [[MS-DOS]]. A file handle is generally either an [[opaque data type]] or an integer, it was introduced in around 1961 by the [[ALGOL 60|ALGOL-based]] [[Burroughs MCP]] running on the [[Burroughs B5000]] but is now ubiquitous.\n\n==Back up==\nWhen computer files contain information that is extremely important, a ''[[back-up]]'' process is used to protect against disasters that might destroy the files. Backing up files simply means making copies of the files in a separate location so that they can be restored if something happens to the computer, or if they are deleted accidentally.\n\nThere are many ways to back up files. Most computer systems provide utility programs to assist in the back-up process, which can become very time-consuming if there are many files to safeguard. Files are often copied to removable media such as writable CDs or cartridge tapes. Copying files to another hard disk in the same computer protects against failure of one disk, but if it is necessary to protect against failure or destruction of the entire computer, then copies of the files must be made on other media that can be taken away from the computer and stored in a safe, distant location.\n\nThe [[grandfather-father-son backup]] method automatically makes three back-ups; the grandfather file is the oldest copy of the file and the son is the current copy.\n\n==File systems and file managers==\nThe way a computer organizes, names, stores and manipulates files is globally referred to as its ''[[file system]].'' Most computers have at least one file system. Some computers allow the use of several different file systems. For instance, on newer MS Windows computers, the older FAT-type file systems of [[MS-DOS]] and old versions of Windows are supported, in addition to the [[NTFS]] file system that is the normal file system for recent versions of Windows. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Standard FAT allows only eight-character file names (plus a three-character extension) with no spaces, for example, whereas NTFS allows much longer names that can contain spaces. You can call a file \"<tt>Payroll records</tt>\" in NTFS, but in FAT you would be restricted to something like <tt>payroll.dat</tt> (unless you were using [[File Allocation Table#Long file names|VFAT]], a FAT extension allowing long file names).\n\n[[File manager]] programs are utility programs that allow users to manipulate files directly. They allow you to move, create, delete and rename files and folders, although they do not actually allow you to read the contents of a file or store information in it. Every computer system provides at least one file-manager program for its native file system. For example, File Explorer (formerly Windows Explorer) is commonly used in Microsoft Windows operating systems, and Nautilus is common under several distributions of Linux.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Block (data storage)]]\n* [[Computer file management]]\n* [[Data hierarchy]]\n* [[File camouflage]]\n* [[File copying]]\n* [[File conversion]]\n* [[File deletion]]\n* [[File directory]]\n* [[File manager]]\n* [[File system]]\n* [[Filename]]\n* [[Flat file database]]\n* [[Object composition]]\n* [[Soft copy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|File systems}}\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Data_Formats/ Data Formats}}\n\n\n{{Computer files}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer file}}\n[[Category:Computer files| ]]\n[[Category:Computer file systems|File]]\n[[Category:Inter-process communication]]", "sha1": "ahb1zqs0zrvdrhedx6lweu3hrsqaawo"}}, {"title": "CID", "ns": "0", "id": "7079", "revision": {"id": "859761714", "parentid": "859752136", "timestamp": "2018-09-16T04:06:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fyrael", "id": "6675779"}, "comment": "/* Other uses */ shouldn't be linked", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|CID|Cid|cid}}\n'''CID''' may refer to:\n\n{{tocright}}\n\n==Entertainment==\n===Film===\n* [[C.I.D.

He is celebrated for his principle \u2014 known as the [[Doppler effect]] \u2014 that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer. He used this concept to explain the color of [[binary star]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nChristian Doppler was born in [[Salzburg]] (today Austria) in 1803. After completing high school, Doppler studied philosophy in Salzburg and mathematics and physics at the Imperial\u2013Royal Polytechnic Institute (now [[TU Wien]]), where he became an assistant in 1829. In 1835 he began work at the Prague Polytechnic (now [[Czech Technical University in Prague]]), where he received an appointment in 1841.\n\n[[File:Doppler's Birth House.jpg|thumb|right|Doppler's birth house in [[Salzburg]], just next door to where [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] family had lived.

The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):\n\n{{quote|<poem>Sir [[Christopher Wren]]\nSaid, \"I am going to dine with some men.\nIf anyone calls\nSay I am designing St. Paul's.\"<ref name=bentley>{{cite book|first=E.

According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name \"at the end of the first line\", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>\n\nClerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').\n\n==Practitioners==\nThe form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]].

While the rate of emergence of new civil wars has been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those wars has resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously in the first half of the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent civil wars close to the end of the [[Cold War]]. Since 1945, civil wars have resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the [[forced migration|forced displacement]] of millions more. Civil wars have further resulted in economic collapse; [[Somalia]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar), [[Uganda]] and [[Angola]] are examples of nations that were considered to have had promising futures before being engulfed in civil wars.<ref>Hironaka (2005), pp. 1\u20132, 4\u20135</ref>\n\n== Formal classification ==\n[[File:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|260px|Aftermath of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], [[American Civil War]], 1863]]\n[[James Fearon]], a scholar of civil wars at [[Stanford University]], defines a civil war as \"a violent conflict within a country fought by organized groups that aim to take power at the center or in a region, or to change government policies\".<ref name=fearon/> Ann Hironaka further specifies that one side of a civil war is the [[state (polity)|state]].<ref name=hironaka3/> The intensity at which a civil disturbance becomes a civil war is contested by academics.

This rate is a small fraction of the millions killed in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and [[Cambodian Civil War]], for example, but excludes several highly publicized conflicts, such as [[The Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]] and the struggle of the [[African National Congress]] in [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|Apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]].<ref name=hironaka3/>\n\nBased on the 1000-casualties-per-year criterion, there were 213 civil wars from 1816 to 1997, 104 of which occurred from 1944 to 1997.<ref name=hironaka3/> If one uses the less-stringent 1000 casualties total criterion, there were over 90 civil wars between 1945 and 2007, with 20 ongoing civil wars as of 2007.{{clarify|date=October 2017|The number is lower with a less-stringent def? 104 wars for 1944-47 using 1000 per year, but only 90 wars for 1945-2007 using merely 1000 total?}}<ref name=fearon/>\n\nThe [[Geneva Conventions]] do not specifically define the term \"civil war\"; nevertheless, they do outline the responsibilities of parties in \"armed conflict not of an international character\". This includes civil wars; however, no specific definition of civil war is provided in the text of the Conventions.\n[[File:T-55 Ethiopian Civil War 1991.JPEG|thumb|left|250px|Tanks in the streets of [[Addis Ababa]] after rebels seized the capital during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] (1991)]]\nNevertheless, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has sought to provide some clarification through its commentaries on the [[Geneva Conventions]], noting that the Conventions are \"so general, so vague, that many of the delegations feared that it might be taken to cover any act committed by force of arms\". Accordingly, the commentaries provide for different 'conditions' on which the application of the Geneva Convention would depend; the commentary, however, points out that these should not be interpreted as rigid conditions. The conditions listed by the [[ICRC]] in its commentary are as follows:<ref>Final Record of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Diplomatic Conference of Geneva of 1949]], (Volume II-B, p. 121)</ref><ref>See also the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590006?OpenDocument commentary] on Third 1949 Geneva Convention, Article III, Section \"A.

Roughly stated: are conflicts caused by who people are, whether that be defined in terms of ethnicity, religion or other [[social affiliation]], or do conflicts begin because it is in the economic best interests of individuals and groups to start them? Scholarly analysis supports the conclusion that economic and structural factors are more important than those of identity in predicting occurrences of civil war.<ref>See, for example, Hironaka (2005), pp. 9\u201310, and [[Paul Collier|Collier, Paul]], Anke Hoeffler and Nicholas Sambanis, \"The Collier-Hoeffler Model of Civil War Onset and the Case Study Project Research Design,\" in Collier & Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 13</ref>\n\nA comprehensive study of civil war was carried out by a team from the [[World Bank]] in the early 21st century. The study framework, which came to be called the Collier\u2013Hoeffler Model, examined 78 five-year increments when civil war occurred from 1960 to 1999, as well as 1,167 five-year increments of \"no civil war\" for comparison, and subjected the data set to [[regression analysis]] to see the effect of various factors. The factors that were shown to have a statistically significant effect on the chance that a civil war would occur in any given five-year period were:<ref name=cs17>Collier & Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 17</ref>\n\nA high proportion of primary [[commodity|commodities]] in national exports significantly increases the risk of a conflict. A country at \"peak danger\", with commodities comprising 32% of [[gross domestic product]], has a 22% risk of falling into civil war in a given five-year period, while a country with no primary commodity exports has a 1% risk. When disaggregated, only [[petroleum]] and non-petroleum groupings showed different results: a country with relatively low levels of dependence on petroleum exports is at slightly less risk, while a high level of dependence on oil as an export results in slightly more risk of a civil war than national dependence on another primary commodity. The authors of the study interpreted this as being the result of the ease by which primary commodities may be extorted or captured compared to other forms of wealth; for example, it is easy to capture and control the output of a gold mine or oil field compared to a sector of garment manufacturing or hospitality services.<ref name=cs16>Collier & Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 16</ref>\n\nA second source of finance is national [[diaspora]]s, which can fund rebellions and insurgencies from abroad. The study found that statistically switching the size of a country's diaspora from the smallest found in the study to the largest resulted in a sixfold increase in the chance of a civil war.<ref name=cs16/>\n\nHigher male secondary school enrollment, [[per capita income]] and economic growth rate all had significant effects on reducing the chance of civil war. Specifically, a male secondary school enrollment 10% above the average reduced the chance of a conflict by about 3%, while a growth rate 1% higher than the study average resulted in a decline in the chance of a civil war of about 1%. The study interpreted these three factors as proxies for earnings forgone by rebellion, and therefore that lower forgone earnings encourage rebellion.<ref name=cs16/> Phrased another way: young males (who make up the vast majority of combatants in civil wars) are less likely to join a rebellion if they are getting an education or have a comfortable salary, and can reasonably assume that they will prosper in the future.<ref>Henrik Urdal \u2013 [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/expertpapers/Urdal_Expert%20Paper.pdf A CLASH OF GENERATIONS? YOUTH BULGES AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE] \u2013 ''un.org.'' Retrieved 28 December 2012.</ref>\n\nLow per capita income has been proposed as a cause for grievance, prompting armed rebellion. However, for this to be true, one would expect economic inequality to also be a significant factor in rebellions, which it is not. The study therefore concluded that the economic model of [[opportunity cost]] better explained the findings.<ref name=cs17/>\n\n=== Grievance ===\nMost proxies for \"grievance\"\u2014the theory that civil wars begin because of issues of identity, rather than economics\u2014were statistically insignificant, including economic equality, political rights, ethnic polarization and religious fractionalization. Only ethnic dominance, the case where the largest ethnic group comprises a majority of the population, increased the risk of civil war. A country characterized by ethnic dominance has nearly twice the chance of a civil war. However, the combined effects of ethnic and religious fractionalization, i.e. the greater chance that any two randomly chosen people will be from separate ethnic or religious groups, the less chance of a civil war, were also significant and positive, as long as the country avoided ethnic dominance. The study interpreted this as stating that minority groups are more likely to rebel if they feel that they are being dominated, but that rebellions are more likely to occur the more homogeneous the population and thus more cohesive the rebels.

He disagrees with the quantitative research methods of Collier and believes a stronger emphasis should be put on personal data and human perspective of the people in conflict. \n\nBeyond Keen, several other authors have introduced works that either disprove greed vs. grievance theory with empirical data, or dismiss its ultimate conclusion.

Walter argues that when these issues are properly reversed, they act as political and legal restraints on executive power forcing the established government to better serve the people. Additionally, these political and legal restraints create a standardized avenue to influence government and increase the commitment credibility of established peace treaties. It is the strength of a nation\u2019s institutionalization and good governance\u2014not the presence of democracy nor the poverty level\u2014that is the number one indicator of the chance of a repeat civil war, according to Walter.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Military advantage ====\n[[File:Battle of Siping01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Communist Party of China|Communist]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Siping]], [[Chinese Civil War]], 1946]]\nHigh levels of population dispersion and, to a lesser extent, the presence of mountainous terrain, increased the chance of conflict. Both of these factors favor rebels, as a population dispersed outward toward the borders is harder to control than one concentrated in a central region, while mountains offer terrain where rebels can seek sanctuary.<ref name=cs16/>\n\n==== Population size ====\nThe various factors contributing to the risk of civil war rise increase with population size. The risk of a civil war rises approximately proportionately with the size of a country's population.<ref name=cs17/>\n\n==== Time ====\nThe more time that has elapsed since the last civil war, the less likely it is that a conflict will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the [[depreciation]] of whatever [[Capital (economics)|capital]] the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The study found that the presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.<ref name=cs18/>\n\n[[Evolutionary psychologist]] [[Satoshi Kanazawa]] has argued that an important cause of intergroup conflict may be the relative availability of women of reproductive age.

In 19th-century Europe, the length of civil wars fell significantly, largely due to the nature of the conflicts as battles for the power center of the state, the strength of centralized governments, and the normally quick and decisive intervention by other states to support the government. Following [[World War II]] the duration of civil wars grew past the norm of the pre-19th century, largely due to weakness of the many postcolonial states and the intervention by major powers on both sides of conflict. The most obvious commonality to civil wars are that they occur in [[fragile state]]s.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 28</ref>\n\n=== In the 19th and early 20th centuries ===\n[[File:Tykistokoulun harjoiitus.jpg|thumb|An artillery school set up by the anti-socialist \"Whites\" during the [[Finnish Civil War]], 1918]]\nCivil wars in the 19th century and in the early 20th century tended to be short; civil wars between 1900 and 1944 lasted on average one and half years.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 1</ref> The state itself formed the obvious center of authority in the majority of cases, and the civil wars were thus fought for control of the state. This meant that whoever had control of the capital and the military could normally crush resistance. A rebellion which failed to quickly seize the capital and control of the military for itself normally found itself doomed to rapid destruction. For example, the fighting associated with the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] occurred almost entirely in [[Paris]], and ended quickly once the military sided with the government<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 28\u201329</ref> at Versailles and conquered Paris.\n\nThe power of non-state actors resulted in a lower value placed on [[sovereignty]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, which further reduced the number of civil wars. For example, the [[Barbary pirate|pirates]] of the [[Barbary Coast]] were recognized as ''de facto'' states because of their military power. The Barbary pirates thus had no need to rebel against the [[Ottoman Empire]] \u2013 their nominal state government \u2013 to gain recognition of their sovereignty. Conversely, states such as [[Virginia]] and [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] did not have sovereign status, but had significant political and economic independence coupled with weak federal control, reducing the incentive to secede.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 29</ref>\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.81.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|plane]], supported by [[Fiat CR.32|smaller fighter planes]], of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[Aviazione Legionaria|Legionary Air Force]], allied to [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists, bombs [[Madrid]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939)]]\nThe two major global ideologies, [[monarchism]] and [[democracy]], led to several civil wars. However, a bi-polar world, divided between the two ideologies, did not develop, largely due to the dominance of monarchists through most of the period. The monarchists would thus normally intervene in other countries to stop democratic movements taking control and forming democratic governments, which were seen by monarchists as being both dangerous and unpredictable. The [[Great power|Great Powers]] (defined in the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Austria]], [[Prussia]], [[France]], and [[Russia]]) would frequently coordinate interventions in other nations' civil wars, nearly always on the side of the incumbent government. Given the military strength of the Great Powers, these interventions nearly always proved decisive and quickly ended the civil wars.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 30</ref>\n\nThere were several exceptions from the general rule of quick civil wars during this period. The [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) was unusual for at least two reasons: it was fought around regional identities as well as political ideologies, and it ended through a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], rather than with a decisive battle over control of the capital, as was the norm. The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) proved exceptional because ''both'' sides in the struggle received support from intervening great powers: [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] supported opposition leader [[Francisco Franco]], while [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] supported [[Second Spanish Republic|the government]]<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 31</ref> (see [[proxy war]]).\n\n=== Since 1945 ===\n[[File:Smoke break el serrano 1987.jpg|thumb|right|Members of ARDE Frente Sur at rest after routing a [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] garrison at El Serrano during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] (1987)]]\nIn the 1990s, about twenty civil wars were occurring concurrently during an average year, a rate about ten times the historical average since the 19th century. However, the rate of new civil wars had not increased appreciably; the drastic rise in the number of ongoing wars after [[World War II]] was a result of the tripling of the average duration of civil wars to over four years.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 1, 4-5</ref> This increase was a result of the increased number of states, the [[fragile state|fragility of states]] formed after 1945, the decline in interstate war, and the Cold War rivalry.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 7 & 23</ref>\n\nFollowing  II, the major European powers divested themselves of their colonies at an increasing rate: the number of ex-colonial states jumped from about 30 to almost 120 after the war. The rate of state formation leveled off in the 1980s, at which point few colonies remained.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 36</ref> More states also meant more states in which to have long civil wars. Hironaka statistically measures the impact of the increased number of ex-colonial states as increasing the post-II incidence of civil wars by +165% over the pre-1945 number.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 40</ref>\n\nWhile the new ex-colonial states appeared to follow the blueprint of the idealized state\u2014centralized government, territory enclosed by defined borders, and citizenry with defined rights\u2014as well as accessories such as a national flag, an anthem, a seat at the [[United Nations]] and an official economic policy, they were in actuality far weaker than the Western states they were modeled after.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 54</ref>  In Western states, the structure of governments closely matched states' actual capabilities, which had been arduously developed over centuries. The development of strong administrative structures, in particular those related to extraction of taxes, is closely associated with the intense warfare between predatory European states in the 17th and 18th centuries, or in [[Charles Tilly]]'s famous formulation: \"War made the state and the state made war\".<ref name=H6>Hironaka, 2005, p. 6</ref> For example, the formation of the modern states of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] in the 19th century is closely associated with the wars of expansion and consolidation led by [[Prussia]] and [[Sardinia-Piedmont]], respectively.<ref name=H6/> The Western process of forming effective and impersonal bureaucracies, developing efficient tax systems, and integrating national territory continued into the 20th century. Nevertheless, Western states that survived into the latter half of the 20th century were considered \"strong\" by simple reason that they had managed to develop the institutional structures and military capability required to survive predation by their fellow states.\n\n[[File:US Marine Cadillac Gage LAV and a Fiat-OTO Melara 6614 APC.JPEG|thumb|left|An American Cadillac Gage Light Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle and Italian Fiat-OTO Melara Type 6614 Armored Personnel Carrier guard an intersection during the [[Somali Civil War]] (1993)]]\nIn sharp contrast, [[decolonization]] was an entirely different process of state formation. Most imperial powers had not foreseen a need to prepare their colonies for independence; for example, Britain had given limited self-rule to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], while treating [[British Somaliland]] as little more than a trading post, while all major decisions for French colonies were made in Paris and [[Belgium]] prohibited any self-government up until it suddenly granted independence to its colonies in 1960. Like Western states of previous centuries, the new ex-colonies lacked autonomous bureaucracies, which would make decisions based on the benefit to society as a whole, rather than respond to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] to favor a particular interest group. In such a situation, factions manipulate the state to benefit themselves or, alternatively, state leaders use the bureaucracy to further their own self-interest. The lack of credible governance was compounded by the fact that most colonies were economic loss-makers at independence, lacking both a productive economic base and a taxation system to effectively extract resources from economic activity. Among the rare states profitable at decolonization was India, to which scholars credibly argue that [[Uganda]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Angola]] may be included. Neither did imperial powers make territorial integration a priority, and may have discouraged nascent nationalism as a danger to their rule. Many newly independent states thus found themselves impoverished, with minimal administrative capacity in a fragmented society, while faced with the expectation of immediately meeting the demands of a modern state.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 59\u201361</ref> Such states are considered \"weak\" or \"[[Fragile state|fragile\"]].  The \"strong\"-\"weak\" categorization is not the same as \"Western\"-\"non-Western\", as some Latin American states like [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] and Middle Eastern states like [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]] are considered to have \"strong\" administrative structures and economic infrastructure.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 56</ref>\n\n[[File:Checkpoint 4, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|right|A checkpoint manned by the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] army and [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], 1982. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u20131990) was characterized by multiple foreign interventions.]]\nHistorically, the international community would have targeted weak states for territorial absorption or colonial domination or, alternatively, such states would fragment into pieces small enough to be effectively administered and secured by a local power. However, international norms towards sovereignty changed in the wake of  II in ways that support and maintain the existence of weak states. Weak states are given ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty equal to that of other states, even when they do not have ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty or control of their own territory, including the privileges of international diplomatic recognition and an equal vote in the United Nations. Further, the international community offers [[development aid]] to weak states, which helps maintain the facade of a functioning modern state by giving the appearance that the state is capable of fulfilling its implied responsibilities of control and order.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 6</ref> The formation of a strong [[international law]] regime and norms against territorial aggression is strongly associated with the dramatic drop in the number of interstate wars, though it has also been attributed to the effect of the Cold War or to the changing nature of economic development. Consequently, military aggression that results in territorial annexation became increasingly likely to prompt international condemnation, diplomatic censure, a reduction in international aid or the introduction of economic sanction, or, as in the case of 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] by [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], international military intervention to reverse the territorial aggression.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, p. 16</ref> Similarly, the international community has largely refused to recognize secessionist regions, while keeping some secessionist self-declared states such as [[Somaliland]] in diplomatic recognition limbo. While there is not a large body of academic work examining the relationship, Hironaka's statistical study found a correlation that suggests that every major international anti-secessionist declaration increased the number of ongoing civil wars by +10%, or a total +114% from 1945 to 1997.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 37\u201340</ref> The diplomatic and legal protection given by the international community, as well as economic support to weak governments and discouragement of secession, thus had the unintended effect of encouraging civil wars.\n\n[[File:LTTE Sea Tigers attack vessel by sunken SL freighter.JPG|thumb|left|A fast attack boat of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|rebel LTTE]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in 2003 passes the hulk of an LTTE supply ship that had been sunk by government aircraft, [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] (1983\u20132009)]]\n\n====Interventions by outside powers====\nThere has been an enormous amount of international intervention in civil wars since 1945 that some have argued served to extend wars. According to [[Patrick M. Regan]] in his book ''Civil Wars and Foreign Powers'' (2000) about 2/3rds of the 138 intrastate conflicts between the end of World War II and 2000 saw international intervention, with the United States intervening in 35 of these conflicts.<ref name=\"foreignaffairs.com\"/> While intervention has been practiced since the international system has existed, its nature changed substantially. It became common for both the state and opposition group to receive foreign support, allowing wars to continue well past the point when domestic resources had been exhausted. Superpowers, such as the European [[great powers]], had always felt no compunction in intervening in civil wars that affected their interests, while distant regional powers such as the United States could declare the interventionist [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1821 for events in its Central American \"backyard\". However, the large population of weak states after 1945 allowed intervention by former colonial powers, regional powers and neighboring states who themselves often had scarce resources.\n\n===== Effectiveness of intervention =====\nThe effectiveness of intervention is widely debated, in part because the data suffers from selection bias; as Fortna has argued, peacekeepers select themselves into difficult cases.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785583130|title=Does peacekeeping work? shaping belligerents' choices after civil war|last=Page)|first=Fortna, V. Page (Virginia|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691136714|oclc=785583130}}</ref> When controlling for this effect, Forta holds that peacekeeping is resoundingly successful in shortening wars. However, other scholars disagree. Knaus and Stewart are extremely skeptical as to the effectiveness of interventions, holding that they can only work when they are performed with extreme caution and sensitivity to context, a strategy they label 'principled incrementalism'. Few interventions, for them, have demonstrated such an approach.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916002160|title=Can intervention work?|last=Gerald.|first=Knaus,|isbn=9780393342246|oclc=916002160|year=2012}}</ref> Other scholars offer more specific criticisms; Dube and Naidu, for instance, show that US military aid, a less conventional form of intervention, seems to be siphoned off to paramilitaries thus exacerbating violence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube, Vargas|first=|date=2015|title=Bases, Bullets and Ballots; The Effect of US-Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/679021|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=77:1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|citeseerx=10.1.1.622.2394}}</ref> Weinstein holds more generally that interventions might disrupt processes of 'autonomous recovery' whereby civil war contributes to state-building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgdev.org/files/2731_file_WP57.pdf|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective, CGDEV Working Paper|last=Weinstein|first=Jeremy|date=April 2005|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOn average, a civil war with interstate intervention was 300% longer than those without. When disaggregated, a civil war with intervention on only one side is 156% longer, while when intervention occurs on both sides the average civil war is longer by an additional 92%. If one of the intervening states was a superpower, a civil war is a further 72% longer; a conflict such as the [[Angolan Civil War]], in which there is two-sided foreign intervention, including by a superpower (actually, two superpowers in the case of Angola), would be 538% longer on average than a civil war without any international intervention.<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n=== Effect of the Cold War ===\n[[File:Berlin 1990 75540011.jpg|thumb|right|Fall and demolition of the [[Berlin Wall]] at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] (1990)]]\nThe [[Cold War]] (1947\u20131991) provided a global network of material and ideological support that often helped perpetuate civil wars, which were mainly fought in weak ex-colonial states rather than the relatively strong states that were aligned with the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. In some cases, [[superpower]]s would superimpose Cold War ideology onto local conflicts, while in others local actors using Cold War ideology would attract the attention of a superpower to obtain support. Using a separate statistical evaluation than used above for interventions, civil wars that included pro- or anti-communist forces lasted 141% longer than the average non-Cold War conflict, while a Cold War civil war that attracted superpower intervention resulted in wars typically lasting over three times as long as other civil wars. Conversely, the [[Revolutions of 1989|end of the Cold War]] marked by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 resulted in a reduction in the duration of Cold War civil wars of 92% or, phrased another way, a roughly ten-fold increase in the rate of resolution of Cold War civil wars. Lengthy Cold War-associated civil conflicts that ground to a halt include the wars of [[Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemala]] (1960\u20131996), [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] (1979\u20131991) and [[History of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] (1970\u20131990).<ref>Hironaka, 2005, pp. 48-50</ref>\n\n=== Post-2003 ===\nAccording to Barbara F. Walter, \"post-2003 civil wars are different from previous civil wars in three striking ways. First, most of them are situated in Muslim-majority countries. Second, most of the rebel groups fighting these wars espouse radical Islamist ideas and goals.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to [[cocoa mass]], unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called [[chocolate liquor]]. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: [[cocoa solids]] and [[cocoa butter]]. [[Baking chocolate]], also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any [[added sugar]]. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of [[sweet chocolate]], a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. [[Milk chocolate]] is sweet chocolate that additionally contains [[milk powder]] or [[condensed milk]]. [[White chocolate]] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created, particularly [[dessert]]s including [[chocolate cake|cakes]], [[chocolate pudding|pudding]], [[chocolate mousse|mousse]], [[chocolate brownie]]s, and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s. Many [[candy|candies]] are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate, and [[chocolate bar|bars]] of solid chocolate and [[candy bar]]s coated in chocolate are eaten as [[snack]]s. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (e.g., eggs, hearts, coins) have become traditional on certain Western holidays, such as [[Easter egg#Chocolate eggs|Easter]], [[Valentine's Day]], and [[Hanukkah gelt|Hanukkah]]. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as [[chocolate milk]] and [[hot chocolate]] and in some alcoholic drinks, such as [[creme de cacao]].\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, recent years have seen African nations assuming a leading role in producing cocoa.

Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called \"baking chocolate\", contains primarily [[cocoa solids]] and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with [[sugar]].\n\n=== Milk ===\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.<ref name=\"Europa\">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0036:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 June 2000 relating to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption|publisher=[[Publications Office of the European Union]]|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== White ===\n{{Main|white chocolate}}\n[[File:White chocolate with rose petals.jpg|thumb|White Chocolate]]\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] calls this \"sweet chocolate\", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.<ref name=\"Europa\" /> A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking.

The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n[[File:Chocolate fountain.jpg|thumb|upright|Fountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a [[chocolate fountain]] to serve as [[Chocolate fondue|dessert fondue]].]]\n* Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n* Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n* White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an [[emulsifying agent]], such as [[soy lecithin]], is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using [[Polyglycerol polyricinoleate|PGPR]], an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same [[mouthfeel]].\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own \"signature\" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.<ref name=\"ww\"/> Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and [[artificial flavor|artificial]] vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], and [[Archer Daniels Midland]], [[lobbying|lobbied]] the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute [[partially hydrogenated vegetable oils]] for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bragg |first=Lynn |title=Letter to CMA from President |year=2007 |url=http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604203647/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2007 |accessdate=8 June 2007}}</ref> Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as \"chocolate\" if the product contains any of these ingredients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0085/07p-0085.htm |title=Adopt Regulations of General Applicability to all Food Standards that would Permit, within Stated Boundaries, Deviations from the Requirements of the Individual Food Standards of Identity |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=9 June 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522143217/http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0085/07p-0085.htm |archivedate=22 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.typetive.com/blogimages/07p-0085AppendixC.pdf |title=2007P-0085 Appendix C Changes Allowed to Modernize Food Standards While Retaining The Basic Nature and Essential Characteristics of Standardized Food |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labelled as \"family milk chocolate\" rather than \"milk chocolate\" if it contains 20% milk.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/678141.stm Sweet victory for UK chocolate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803100828/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/678141.stm |date=3 August 2017 }} BBC News (15 March 2000)</ref>\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-33.html#h-66|title=Division 4: Cocoa and Chocolate Products|publisher=Government of Canada: Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870)|date=13 June 2017|accessdate=20 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713042147/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-33.html#h-66|archivedate=13 July 2017}}</ref> a \"chocolate product\" is a food product that is sourced from at least one \"cocoa product\" and contains at least one of the following: \"chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate\".

Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72&nbsp;hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours.

The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid \"seed\" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a [[chocolate temper meter]] to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n* Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal \"seeds\"; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n* Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to \"inoculate\" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to \"seed\" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular [[continuous production|continuous]] tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and [[B\u00fchler|Buhler]], three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\u201350&nbsp;\u00b0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce [[shear force|shear]], then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.<ref>{{cite patent |country=EP |number=0289849 |status=Granted |title=Process and apparatus for the continuous preparation of cacao butter or similar fat-containing masses to be processed |pubdate=1988-11-09 |gdate= |fdate=1988-04-19 |pridate= |inventor=Helmut Sollich |invent1= |invent2= |assign1=Sollich KG |assign2= |class= |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0289849A2/en}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent |country=EP |number=2862449 |status=Pending |title=Method and use of an apparatus for continuous tempering of chocolate mass comprising crystals |pubdate=2015-04-22 |gdate= |fdate=2013-10-18 |pridate= |inventor=Peter Braun |invent1=Konstantinos Paggios |invent2= |assign1=B\u00fchler AG |assign2= |class= |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2862449A1/en}}</ref>\n\n===Storage===\n[[File:Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop Inside, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|Packaged chocolate in the [[Ghirardelli Chocolate Company]] is stored in controlled conditions.]]\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between {{convert|15|and|17|C|F}}, with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of \"blooming\" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=X-rays reveal how chocolate turns white|journal=Science|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/chemistry/2015/05/x-rays-reveal-how-chocolate-turns-white|last=DeMarco|first=E.|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.aac4563 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180034/http://news.sciencemag.org/chemistry/2015/05/x-rays-reveal-how-chocolate-turns-white |archivedate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Chocolate bloom]] is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding {{convert|24|C|F}}, while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below {{convert|15|C|F}} or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Ghirardelli]] |title=Tips for Chocolate Care |url=http://www.ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206082048/http://ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Teresa |last=Miller |url=http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609144511/http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html |archivedate=9 June 2007 |title=Milkfat Fractions Help Beat Blooming Chocolate |publisher=College of Agricultural Life and Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=16 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php |publisher=CocoaBella |title=How to Store Chocolate |accessdate=16 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208160345/http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php |archivedate=8 February 2007}}</ref> Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Bau |editor-first=Frederic |year=2011 |title=Cooking With Chocolate: Essential Recipes and Techniques |location=Paris |publisher=Flammarion, S.A. |page=147 |isbn=978-2-08-020081-5}}</ref>\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas.

Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Michael Barratt | year = 2007 | title = 'Fair Trade' with Africa | journal = Review of African Political Economy | volume = 34 | issue = 112| pages = 267\u201377 | doi=10.1080/03056240701449653 |jstor=20406397 }}</ref> One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]].

The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned.

Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of [[candy bar]]s, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., [[nougat]], [[wafer]]s, [[caramel]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n[[File:Blackout cake.jpg|thumb|Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting]]\n=== Coating and filling ===\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many [[dessert]]s, such as [[chocolate cake]]s, [[chocolate brownie]]s, [[chocolate mousse]] and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s. Numerous types of [[candy]] and [[snack]]s contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., [[M&M's]]) or as a coating (e.g., [[chocolate-coated raisins]] or [[chocolate-coated peanuts]]).\n\n=== Beverages ===\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as [[chocolate milk]], [[hot chocolate]] and chocolate [[milkshakes]]. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as [[chocolate liqueur]] and [[creme de cacao]]. Chocolate is a popular flavour of [[ice cream]] and [[chocolate pudding|pudding]], and [[chocolate sauce]] is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream [[sundae]]s.\n\n==Popular culture==\n\n===Religious and cultural links===\n[[File:Ei-chocolatier.JPG|thumb|[[Chocolatier]] preparing Easter eggs and rabbits]]\n[[File:Chocolate Coins (11734033133).jpg|thumb|[[Chocolate coins]]]]\nChocolate is associated with festivals such as [[Easter customs|Easter]], when moulded chocolate rabbits and eggs are traditionally given in Christian communities, and [[Hanukkah]], when chocolate coins are given in Jewish communities. Chocolate [[heart (symbol)|hearts]] and chocolate in heart-shaped boxes are popular on [[Valentine's Day]] and are often presented along with flowers and a [[greeting card]]. In 1868, [[Cadbury]] created Fancy Boxes \u2013 a decorated box of chocolates \u2013 in the shape of a heart for Valentine's Day.<ref name=\"Chocolates\"/> Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday.<ref name=\"Chocolates\"/> Chocolate is an acceptable gift on other holidays and on occasions such as birthdays.\n\nMany confectioners make holiday-specific chocolate candies. Chocolate [[Easter eggs]] or rabbits and [[Santa Claus]] figures are two examples. Such confections can be solid, hollow, or filled with sweets or fondant.\n\n===Books and film===\nChocolate has been the center of several successful book and film adaptations.\n\n==== Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ====\nIn 1964, [[Roald Dahl]] published a children's novel titled ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. The novel centers on a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who takes a tour through the greatest chocolate factory in the world, owned by [[Willy Wonka]]. Two film adaptations of the novel were produced. The first was ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', a 1971 film which later became a [[cult classic]], and spawned the real world [[The Willy Wonka Candy Company|Willy Wonka Candy Company]], which produces chocolate products to this day.
