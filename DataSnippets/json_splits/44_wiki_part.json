The rhyming phrase \"apples and pears\" evolved to mean \"stairs\". Following the pattern of omission, \"and pears\" is dropped, thus the spoken phrase \"I'm going up the apples\" means \"I'm going up the stairs\".<ref name=\"cockney-guide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/guide-to-cockney-rhyming-slang|title=Guide to Cockney Rhyming Slang|date=9 June 2014|access-date=25 March 2018|website=The Guardian|last=Jacot de Boinod|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Jacot de Boinod}}</ref>\n\nThe following are further common examples of these phrases:<ref name=\"cockney-guide\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Slang Word !! Meaning !!

I couldn't believe me mincers, so I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog to me trouble and we had a Turkish.\"\n\nIn some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of rhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word \"Aris\" is often used to indicate the buttocks. This is the result of a double rhyme, starting with the original rough synonym \"arse\", which is rhymed with \"bottle and glass\", leading to \"bottle\". \"Bottle\" was then rhymed with \"Aristotle\" and truncated to \"Aris\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28477779|title=Cockney rabbit : a Dick'n'Arry of rhyming slang|last=Puxley,|first=Ray|date=1992|publisher=Robson Books|year=|isbn=978-0860518273|location=London|pages=4\u20135|oclc=28477779}}</ref><!--<ref name=mother/>DEMANDS VERIFICATION FROM EXPERT OR SECOND SOURCE, SEE EDIT SUMMARY-->\n\n===Phonetic ''versus'' phono-semantic forms===\n[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], a [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Language revitalization|revivalist]], has proposed a distinction between rhyming slang based on sound only, and phono-semantic rhyming slang, which includes a semantic link between the slang expression and its [[referent]] (the thing it refers to).<ref name = Zuckermann03>[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]].

Partridge72/>{{rp|p. 12}} [[John Camden Hotten]]'s 1859 ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words|Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]'' likewise states that it originated in the 1840s (\"about twelve or fifteen years ago\"), but with \"chaunters\" and \"patterers\" in the [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] area of London.<ref name=\"hott\"/> The reference is to travelling salesmen of certain kinds, chaunters selling sheet music and patterers offered cheap, tawdry goods at fairs and markets up and down the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hotten's ''Dictionary'' included the first known \"Glossary of the Rhyming Slang\", which included later mainstays such as \"frog and toad\" (the main road) and \"apples and pears (stairs), as well as many more obscure examples, e.g. \"Battle of the Nile\" (a tile, a  vulgar term for a hat), \"Duke of York\" (take a walk), and \"Top of Rom\" (home).<ref name=\"hott\"/>\n\nIt remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a [[cryptolect]] developed intentionally to confuse non-locals.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community, or to allow traders to talk amongst themselves in marketplaces in order to facilitate [[collusion]], without customers knowing what they were saying, or by criminals to confuse the police (see [[thieves' cant]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe English academic, lexicographer and radio personality [[Terence Dolan]] has suggested that rhyming slang may have been invented by Irish immigrants to London \"so the actual English wouldn't understand what they were talking about.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eolas Staff &

2010}}\n}}\nMany examples of rhyming slang are based on locations in London, such as \"[[Peckham Rye]]\", meaning \"tie\" (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; \"[[Hampstead Heath]]\", meaning \"teeth\" (usually as \"Hampsteads\"), which was first recorded in 1887; and \"[[Barnet Fair]]\", meaning \"hair\", which dates from the 1850s.\n\nBy the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example \"[[Gregory Peck]]\"  meaning \"neck\" and also \"cheque\"; \"[[Ruby Murray]]\" meaning \"curry\"; \"Alans\", meaning \"knickers\" from [[Alan Whicker]]; \"[[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]]\" meaning \"pillow\" when pronounced /\u02c8pil\u0259/  and \"[[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Halls]]\" for \"balls (testicles)\".\n\nThe use of personal names as rhymes continued into the late 20th century, for example \"[[Tony Blair]]s\" meaning \"flares\", as in trousers with a wide bottom (previously this was \"[[Lionel Blair]]s\"  and this change illustrates the ongoing mutation of the forms of expression) and  \"[[Britney Spears]]\", meaning \"beers\".\n\nMany examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. \"To have a butcher's\", meaning to have a look, originates from \"[[butcher]]'s hook\", an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as \"butchers\". Similarly, \"use your loaf\", meaning \"use your head\", derives from \"loaf of [[bread]]\" and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.<ref name=\"ayto\" />{{page needed|date=January 2017}} To \"have a giraffe\" is commonly employed for a \"laugh\"<!--, although technically this does not involve hemiteleia-->.\n\nIn some cases, false etymologies exist. For example, the term \"barney\" has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, although without a clear derivation.<ref name = Partridge91>{{cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | year = 1991 | title = A Concise Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0415063524 | url =  | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}</ref>{{rp|p. 22}} In the 2001 feature film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', the explanation for the term is that it derives from [[Barney Rubble]],{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the name of a cartoon character from the ''[[The Flintstones|Flintstones]]'' television  program many decades later in origin, and so an obviously incorrect explanation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}<!--Early bulletin board posting moved to external links as a non-authoritative source that DOES NOT IN ANY CASE SUPPORT THIS SENTENCE.--><ref>For an authoritative definition and etymology, see \"Barney,\" op. cit., at {{cite book | author = Partridge, Eric | editor = Beale, Paul | year = 2002 | title = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | location = London | publisher = Routledge | edition = 8th Edn. | isbn = 978-0415291897 | url =  | access-date =  }}</ref>\n\n===Regional and international variations===\nRhyming slang is used mainly in London in England but can to some degree be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. For instance, the term \"Charing Cross\" (a place in London), used to mean \"horse\" since the mid-19th century,<ref name=\"ayto\" />{{page needed|date=January 2017}} does not work for a speaker without the [[lot\u2013cloth split]], common in London at that time but not nowadays. A similar example is \"Joanna\" meaning \"piano\", which is based on the pronunciation of \"piano\" as \"pianna\" {{IPAc-en|p|i|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|\u0259}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed \"Derby Road\", which rhymes with \"cold\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOutside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], with local variations. For example, in Australian slang, the term for an English person is \"[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|pommy]]\", which has been proposed as a rhyme on \"pomegranate\" rhyming with \"immigrant\".<ref>The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{clarify|date=January 2017}} cites a well-known Australian weekly, ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which on 14 November 1912 reported: \"The other day a Pummy Grant (assisted immigrant) was handed a bridle and told to catch a horse.\" See {{cite dictionary | entry = \"Pomegranate\" [Usage examples] | work = Oxford English Dictionary | via = Dictionary.OED.com | date = | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50183640?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=pomegranate&first=1&max_to_show=10 | subscription = yes | dead-url = yes | access-date =  | quote = }}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}</ref><ref name = Partridge91/>{{rp|p. 342}}\n\nRhyming slang as such is not in general use in the United States, but a few notable exceptions include<ref name=\"american-slang\">{{cite book|isbn=9780415371827|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5F-YNZRv-VMC|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date=2009|pages=122,123,327}}</ref>:\n*\"bread\"<ref name=\"american-slang\"/>{{rp|p. 123}} [bread & honey = money]\n*\"blow a raspberry\"<ref>{{cite web |title=25 maps that explain the English language |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/3/3/8053521/25-maps-that-explain-english |website=Vox |publisher=Vox |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref> [raspberry tart = fart]\n*\"put up your dukes\"<ref name=\"american-slang\"/>{{rp|p. 327}} [Duke of York = fork, a [[Cockney]] slang term for \"fist\"]\n*\"brass tacks\"<ref name=\"american-slang\"/>{{rp|p. 122}} [facts]\n\nRhyming slang is continually evolving, and new phrases are introduced all the time; new personalities replace old ones\u2014pop culture introduces new words\u2014as in \"I haven't a Scooby\" (from [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]], the eponymous cartoon dog of the [[Scooby-Doo|cartoon series]]) meaning \"I haven't a clue\".<ref>{{cite dictionary|entry=Scooby\"|work=Oxford Dictionaries|via=OxfordDictionaries.com|date=22 March 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scooby|access-date=22 March 2017|quote=1990s; earliest use found in The Glasgow Herald.

Examples include ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999); ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000); ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000); ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001); and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002); ''[[It's All Gone Pete Tong]]'' (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey [[Pete Tong]] whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for \"wrong\"; ''[[Green Street Hooligans]]'' (2005). In [[Margin Call (film)|''Margin Call'']] (2011), Will Emerson, played by London-born actor [[Paul Bettany]], asks a friend on the telephone, \"How's the trouble and strife?\" (\"wife\").\n\n[[Cockneys vs Zombies]] (2012) mocked the genesis of rhyming slang terms when a Cockney character calls zombies \"Trafalgars\" to even his Cockney fellows' puzzlement; he then explains it thus: \"''Trafalgar square - fox and hare - hairy cheek - five day week - weak and feeble - pins and needles - needle and stitch - Abercrombie and Fitch - Abercrombie: zombie''\".\n\n===Television===\nOne early US show to regularly feature rhyming slang was the Saturday morning children's show ''[[The Bugaloos]]'' (1970\u201372), with the character of Harmony ([[Wayne Laryea]]) often incorporating it in his dialogue.\n\nIn Britain, rhyming slang had a resurgence of popular interest beginning in the 1970s, resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (1970\u201374); and ''[[Not On Your Nellie]]'' (1974\u201375), starring [[Hylda Baker]] as Nellie Pickersgill, alludes to the phrase \"not on your Nellie Duff\", rhyming slang for \"not on your puff\" i.e. not on your life. Similarly, ''[[The Sweeney]]'' (1975\u201378) alludes to the phrase \"Sweeney Todd\" for \"[[Flying Squad]]\", a rapid response unit of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police. In ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' (1976\u201379), a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously attempted to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids'='kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). It was also featured in an episode of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' in the first season (1975) where Tom and Barbara purchase a wood burning range from a junk trader called Sam, who litters his language with phony slang in hopes of getting higher payment. He comes up with a fake story as to the origin of Cockney Rhyming slang and is caught out rather quickly. In ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' season 2 (1976) episode \"The Breakup: Part 2\", [[Harry Bentley (character)|Mr. Bentley]] explains Cockney rhyming slang to [[George Jefferson]], in that \"whistle and flute\" means \"suit\", \"apples and pears\" means \"stairs\", \"plates of meat\" means \"feet\".\n\nThe use of rhyming slang was also prominent in ''[[Mind Your Language]]'' (1977\u201379), ''[[Citizen Smith]]'' (1977\u201380), ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]''<ref>{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Brian |year=2002 |title=The Phenomenon That Was Minder |page= |location= |publisher=Chameleon Press |isbn=978-9628681211 |url= |access-date= }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}} (1979\u201394), ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' (1981\u201391), and ''[[EastEnders]]'' (1985-). ''Minder'' could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, \"iron\" was \"male homosexual\" ('iron'='iron hoof'='poof'). One episode in Series 5 of ''Steptoe and Son'' was entitled \"Any Old Iron\", for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'.\n\n===Music===\nIn popular music, [[Spike Jones]] and his City Slickers recorded \"So 'Elp Me\", based on rhyming slang<!-- (without the hemiteleia)-->, in 1950.  The 1967 [[Kinks]] song \"Harry Rag\" was based on the usage of the name [[Harry Wragg]] as rhyming slang for \"fag\" (i.e. a cigarette). The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit \"Cockney Translation\" by [[Smiley Culture]] of [[South London]]; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's \"Cockney and Yardie\". London-based artists such as [[Audio Bullys]] and [[Chas & Dave]] (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as [[The Streets]], who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs.\n\nBritish-born M.C. [[MF Doom]] released an ode entitled \"Rhymin' Slang\", after settling in the UK in 2010. The track was released on the 2012 album [[JJ Doom]] album ''Keys to the Kuffs''.\n\n===Literature===\nIn modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of [[Kim Newman]], for instance in the short story collections \"The Man from the Diogenes Club\" (2006) and \"Secret Files of the Diogenes Club\" (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.<ref>{{cite web | author = Newman, Kim  | date = June 18, 2014 | title = ''Cult'': A Shambles in Belgravia | website = BBC.com | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/sherlock/shamblesinbelgravia1.shtml | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}</ref> In the novel ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], this slang is also frequently used.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} \n\nIt is also parodied in Pratchett's ''Going Postal'', which features a geriatric Junior Postman by the name of Tolliver Groat, a speaker of 'Dimwell Arrhythmic Rhyming Slang', or rather, rhyming slang which ''does not actually rhyme''. Thus, a wig is a 'prunes', from 'syrup of prunes', an obvious parody of the Cockney ''syrup'' from ''syrup of figs -- wig''.  There are numerous other parodies, though it has been pointed out that the result is even more impenetrable than a conventional rhyming slang and so may not be quite so illogical as it seems, given the assumed purpose of rhyming slang as a means of communicating in a manner unintelligible to all but the initiated.\n\n===Sport===\nIn Scottish football, a number of clubs have nicknames taken from rhyming slang. Partick Thistle are known as the \"Harry Rags\", which is taken from the rhyming slang of their 'official' nickname \"the jags\". Rangers are known as the \"Teddy Bears\", which comes from the rhyming slang for \"the Gers\" (shortened version of Ran-gers).  Heart of Midlothian are known as the \"Jambos\", which comes from \"Jam Tarts\" which is the rhyming slang for \"Hearts\" which is the common abbreviation of the Club's name. Hibernian are also referred to as \"The Cabbage\" which comes from Cabbage and Ribs being the rhyming slang for Hibs.\n\n===Politics===\nJunior doctors in the United Kingdom have helped popularise rhyming slang for the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Jeremy Hunt]], amidst dispute over a new contract which has been imposed upon them. This was additionally supported in a tweet by James Blunt.<ref>{{cite web | author = Bartlett, Evan | date = February 11, 2016 | title = James Blunt is 'Handing Over his Cockney Rhyming Slang Title' to Jeremy Hunt | website = Indy100.com | url = https://www.indy100.com/article/james-blunt-is-handing-over-his-cockney-rhyming-slang-title-to-jeremy-hunt--byLlHOQA6e | access-date=January 26, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argot]]\n*[[Costermonger]]\n*[[Euphemism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/13/messages/932.html \"Having a barney\", bulletin board discussion at Phrases.org.uk]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSFoY3W3NM To Sir With Love, on YouTube.com]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rhyming Slang}}\n[[Category:British slang|*]]\n[[Category:London society]]\n[[Category:English language in England]]\n[[Category:English-based argots]]\n[[Category:London words]]\n[[Category:Language games]]\n[[Category:Rhyme]]", "sha1": "ha0cu2ep9xffipppw9mde5pmwmal9xp"}}, {"title": "Canchim", "ns": "0", "id": "7265", "revision": {"id": "831253141", "parentid": "711367781", "timestamp": "2018-03-19T16:31:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "WereSpielChequers", "id": "4071608"}, "comment": "/* Formation of the breed */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], replaced: where also \u2192 were also using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Touro_Canchim_REFON.jpg|thumb|A Canchim bull]]\nThe '''Canchim breed''' is a breed of [[beef cattle]] developed in Central [[Brazil]] by crossing European [[Charolais cattle]] with [[Indo-Brazilian cattle|Indubrazil cattle]] already kept in Brazil where Asian [[Zebu]] type cattle are best suited to the tropical conditions. When compared with Zebu bulls, Canchim bulls produce the same number of calves, but heavier and of superior quality. Compared to European breeds, the Canchim bull produces calves with the same weight but in larger numbers. The fast-growing progeny, from crossbred zebu cows with Canchim bulls, can be slaughtered at 18 months old from feedlots after weaning, up to 24 months old from feedlots after grazing and at 30 months from grazing on the range.\n\n==Origin==\nZebu cattle (Bos Indicus), introduced to Brazil in the last century, were extensively crossbred with herds of native cattle. The Indian breed, well known for its ability to survive in the tropics, adapted quickly to Brazil, and soon populated large areas, considerably improving Brazilian beef cattle breeding. Zebu cattle were however found to be inferior to the European breeds in growth rate and yield of meat. It became clear that the beef cattle population required genetic improvement. Simply placing European beef cattle (Bos Taurus), highly productive in [[temperate climates]], in Central Brazil, would not produce good results, due to their inability to adapt to a [[tropical]] environment. Besides the climate, other factors such as the high occurrence of [[parasitism|parasites]], diseases and the very low nutritional value of the native forage were problems.\n\n==Formation of the breed==\nThe European breed used in the formation of Canchim cattle was Charolais.<ref>[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/canchim/index.htm Oklahoma State University breed profile]</ref> In 1922 the Ministry of Agriculture imported Charolais cattle to the State of [[Goias]], where they remained till 1936, when they were transferred to [[S\u00e3o Carlos]] in the State of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], to the Canchim Farm of the Government Research Station, [[EMBRAPA]]. From this herd originated the dams and sires utilised in the program of crossbreeding.\n\nThe main Zebu breed which contributed to the formation to the Canchim was the Indubrazil, although Guzer\u00e1 and [[Nelore]] cattle were also used. Preference was given to the Indubrasil breed, due to the ease of obtaining large herds at reasonable prices, which would have been difficult with [[Gir cattle|Gir]], Nelore or Guzer\u00e1.\n\nThe alternative crossbreeding programs initiated in 1940 by Dr. Antonio Teixeira Viana had the objective of obtaining first, crossbreeds 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu and second, 3/8 Charolais x 5/8 Zebu, to evaluate which of the two was the most successful. The total number of Zebu cows utilized to produce the half-breeds was 368, of which 292 were Indubrasil, 44 Guzer\u00e1 and 32 Nelore. All the animals produced were reared exclusively on the range. Control of parasites was done every 15 days and the animals were weighed at birth and monthly. The females were weighed up to 30 months and the males up to 40 months.\nThe data collected during various years of work, permitted an evaluation of the various degrees of crossbreeding. The conclusion was that the 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu was the most suitable, presenting an excellent frame for meat, precocious, resistance to heat and parasites, and a uniform coat.<ref>[http://www.embrapa.gov.br/english/portfolio/animal%20prod/canchim/ EMBRAPA website]</ref> The first crossbred animals, 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu, were born in 1953. Thus was born a new type of beef cattle for Central Brazil, with the name CANCHIM, derived from the name of a tree very common in the region where the breed was developed. It was not until 1971 that the Brazilian Association of Canchim Cattle Breeders (ABCCAN) was formed, and on 11 November 1972 the Herd Book was initiated. On 18 May 1983 the Ministry of Agriculture, recognized Canchim type cattle as a Breed.\n\n==New bloodlines==\nThe Canchim breed, being a synthetic breed, permits breeders, in the development of new crossbreeding systems, to use the breeds used to form the Canchim breed, besides the breed itself, in its development.\n\nThere are many Canchim breeders forming new blood lines. Today the Nelore breed totally dominates the Zebu breed in the formation of Canchim. American and French Charolais semen, from carefully selected bulls is also used and recommended by the ABCCAN to form new bloodlines.\n\n==Past Presidents of the Brazilian Association of Canchim Cattle Breeders==\n* Roberto Luiz de Souza Barros; 1971\u20131978\n* Francisco Jacintho da Silveira; 1978\u20131982\n* Diogo Antonio de Barros; 1984\u20131992\n* Jo\u00e3o Paulo Marques Canto Porto; 1992\u20131997\n* Peter Anthony Baines; 1997\u20132001\n* Deniz Ferreira Ribeiro; 2001\u20132007\n* Luiz Adelar Scheuer; 2007\u20132009\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.embryoplus.com/cattle_canchim.html Extensive article at Embryoplus.com]\n* [http://www.canchim.com.br Breed society site in Portuguese]\n\n[[Category:Cattle breeds]]\n[[Category:Cattle breeds originating in Brazil]]\n[[Category:S\u00e3o Carlos]]", "sha1": "ngxcpxwbxsuyrw334k7n8dc0vbu3shy"}}, {"title": "Christkindlmarkt", "ns": "0", "id": "7266", "redirect": {"title": "Christmas market"}, "revision": {"id": "88858649", "parentid": "15905343", "timestamp": "2006-11-19T19:54:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mahagaja", "id": "157842"}, "comment": "fix double redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Christmas market]]", "sha1": "k195uz7xkupsnq9hyi1zr8431tdy547"}}, {"title": "Communist Party of the Soviet Union", "ns": "0", "id": "7271", "revision": {"id": "866317398", "parentid": "865342924", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T16:52:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Laszlo Panaflex", "id": "361935"}, "comment": "/* Post-Stalin years (1953\u201385) */ ce", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|CPSU|other uses|CPSU (disambiguation)|and|Communist Party of the Soviet Union (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| abbreviation = CPSU\n| leader1_title = [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]\n| leader1_name = [[Elena Stasova]] {{small|(first)}}<br>[[Joseph Stalin]]<br>[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] {{small|(last)}}\n| colorcode = {{Communist Party of the Soviet Union/meta/color}}\n| slogan = {{nowrap|''{{lang|en|\"[[Workers of the world, unite!]]\"}}''}}<br />{{small|''\u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d, \u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c!\u00bb''}}<br>\n| anthem = \"[[The Internationale]]\"\n| native_name = {{nowrap|{{small|{{lang|ru|\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430}}}}}}\n| name = Communist Party<br>of the Soviet Union\n| logo = [[File:\u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421.svg|220px]]\n| founded = January 1912<br>{{small|as RSDLP(b)}}<br>March 1918<br>{{small|as RCP(b)}}<br>December 1925<br>{{small|as AUCP(b)}}<br>October 1952<br>{{small|as CPSU}}\n| banned = 29 August 1991<br>{{small|All-Soviet territory}}<br>6 November 1991<br>{{small|RSFSR territory}}\n| founder = [[Vladimir Lenin]]\n| newspaper = ''[[Pravda]]''\n| ideology = [[Communism]]<br>[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]\n| position = [[Far-left politics|Far-left]]\n| international = [[Second International]]<br />{{small|(1912\u201314)}}<ref>https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/c/congress-si.htm#1912</ref><br>[[Comintern]]<br />{{small|(1919\u201343)}}<br>[[Cominform]]<br />{{small|(1947\u201356)}}\n| predecessor = [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]\n| youth_wing = [[Komsomol]]<br>[[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]]\n| colours = {{Color box|{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union/meta/color}}|border=darkgray}} [[Red]]\n| country = the Soviet Union\n| membership = 19 million {{small|(1986)}}\n| website = \n}}\n{{Soviet Union sidebar}}\nThe '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ('''CPSU'''){{efn|{{Lang-rus|\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0301\u0437\u0430|r=Kommunist\u00ed\u010deskaja p\u00e1rtija Sov\u00e9tskovo Soj\u00faza|p=k\u0259m\u028an\u02b2\u026as\u02b2t\u02b2\u02c8it\u0255\u026ask\u0259j\u0259 \u02c8part\u02b2\u026aj\u0259 s\u0250v\u02b2\u02c8etsk\u0259v\u0259 s\u0250\u02c8juz\u0259}}<br/>Abbreviated in English as '''CPSU''' and in Russian as '''\u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421'''}} was the founding and ruling [[political party]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The CPSU was the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] modified [[Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution|Article 6 of the most recent 1977 USSR Constitution]] which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system. The party was founded in 1912 by the [[Bolsheviks]] (a majority faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], RSDLP), a revolutionary group led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924), which seized power in the aftermath of the [[October Revolution]] in November 1917, the second of the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolutions]] of 1917. \n\nAfter 74 years, the party was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory soon after a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed coup d'\u00e9tat]] by conservative hard-line CPSU communists against USSR President and General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and was completely outlawed three months later on 6 November 1991 in Russian territory.\n\nThe CPSU was a [[communist party]] organized on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Lenin that entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party Congress]], which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], (previously the Presidium), the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretariat]] and the [[Orgburo]] (until 1952). The [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|party leader]] was the [[List of heads of government of Russia|head of government]] and held the office of either [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] or [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|head of state]], or some of the three offices concurrently{{mdash}}but never all three at the same time. The party leader was the ''de facto'' chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union. The tension between the party and the state ([[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]]) for the shifting focus of power was never formally resolved, but in reality the party dominated and a [[Primus inter pares|paramount leader]] always existed (first Lenin and thereafter the General Secretary).\n\nAfter the founding of the subsequent [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR or [[Soviet Union]]) in 1922, Lenin had introduced a [[mixed economy]], commonly referred to as the [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed for capitalist practices to resume under the Communist Party dictation in order to develop the necessary conditions for socialism to become a practical pursuit in the economically undeveloped country. In 1929, as Marshal [[Joseph Stalin]] (1878-1953, in power 1929-1953), became the leader of the party, [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], a fusion of the original ideas of [[German Empire|German]] philosopher and economic theorist [[Karl Marx]] (1818-1883), and Lenin, became formalized as the party's guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. The party pursued [[state socialism]], under which all industries were nationalized and a [[planned economy]] was implemented. After recovering from the [[Second World War]] (1939-1945), [[De-Stalinization|reforms were implemented]] which [[1965 Soviet economic reform|decentralized economic planning]] and [[Khrushchev thaw|liberalized Soviet society in general]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1894-1971, in power 1953/1958-1964). By 1980, various factors, including the continuing [[Cold War]] (1946-1991), and ongoing [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[United States]] and other [[Western Europe|Western European]] powers and unaddressed inefficiencies in the economy, led to [[Era of Stagnation|stagnant economic growth]] under [[Alexei Kosygin]] (1904-1980, in power 1964), and further with  [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (1906-1982, in power 1964-1982) and a growing disillusionment. After a younger  vigorous  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (b.1931), assumed leadership in 1985, (following two short-term elderly leaders who quickly died in succession), rapid steps were taken to transform the tottering Soviet economic system in the direction of a [[market economy]] once again. Gorbachev and his allies envisioned the introduction of an economy similar to Lenin's earlier New Economic Policy through a program of \"[[perestroika]]\", or restructuring, but their reforms along with the institution of free multiparty elections led to a decline in the party's power, and after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990-1991), the banning of the party by later last RSFSR President [[Boris Yeltsin]] (1931-2007, in power 1991-1999) and subsequent first President of an evolving democratic and free market economy of the successor [[Russian Federation]].\n\nA number of causes contributed to CPSU's loss of control and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] during 1990-1991. Some historians have written that Gorbachev's policy of \"[[glasnost]]\" (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. Gorbachev maintained that perestroika without glasnost was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the [[economic stagnation]] and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology. In the final years of the CPSU's existence, the Communist Parties of the [[federal subjects of Russia]] were united into the [[Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). After the CPSU's demise, the Communist Parties of the Union Republics became independent and underwent various separate paths of reform. In Russia, the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] emerged and has been regarded as the inheritor of the CPSU's old [[Bolshevik]] legacy into the present day.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\n\n===Name===\n* {{small|1912\u201318:}}<br />'''Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)'''\n* {{small|1918\u201325:}}<br />'''Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'''\n* {{small|1925\u201352:}}<br />'''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'''\n* {{small|1952\u201391:}}<br />'''Communist Party of the Soviet Union'''\n\n===Early years (1912\u201324)===\nThe origin of the CPSU was in the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] majority faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), which, under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]], left the party in January 1912 to form a new one at the Prague Party Conference, called the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks) \u2013 or RSDLP(b). Prior to the [[February Revolution]], the first phase of the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolutions]] of 1917, the party worked underground as organized anti-Tsarist groups. By the time of the revolution, many of the party's central leaders, including Lenin, were in exile.\n\nWith Emperor (Tsar/Czar) [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] (1868-1918, reigned 1894-1917), deposed in February 1917, a [[Russian Republic|republic]] was established and administered by a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]], which was largely dominated by the interests of the military, former nobility, major capitalists business owners and democratic socialists. Alongside it, grassroots general assemblies spontaneously formed, called [[soviet]]s, and a dual-power structure between the soviets and the provisional government was in place until such a time that their differences would be reconciled in a post-provisional government. Lenin was at this time in exile in [[Switzerland]] where he, with other dissidents in exile, managed to arrange with the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] government  safe passage through [[Germany]]  in a sealed train back to Russia through the continent amidst the ongoing [[World War I|World War]]. In April, Lenin arrived in [[Petrograd]] (renamed former [[St. Petersburg]]) and condemned the provisional government, calling for the advancement of the revolution towards the transformation of the ongoing war into a war of the working class against capitalism. The revolution did in fact prove to not yet be over, as tensions between the social forces aligned with the soviets (councils) and those with the provisional government now  led by [[Alexander Kerensky]] (1881-1970, in power 1917), came into explosive tensions during that summer.\n\nThe Bolsheviks had rapidly increased their political presence from May onward through the popularity of their programme, notably calling for an immediate end to the war, land reform for the peasants, and restoring food allocation to the urban population. This programme was translated to the masses through simple slogans that patiently explained their solution to each crisis the revolution created. Up to July these policies were disseminated through 41 publications, [[Pravda]] being the main paper, with a readership of 320,000. This was roughly halved after the repression of the Bolsheviks following the [[July Days]] demonstrations so that even by the end of August the principal paper of the Bolsheviks had a print run of only 50,000 copies. Despite this, their ideas gained them increasing popularity in elections to the soviets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=History of the Russian Revolution|date=1934|publisher=The Camelot Press ltd|location=London|page=808}}</ref>\n\nThe factions within the soviets became increasingly polarized in the later summer after armed demonstrations by soldiers at the call of the Bolsheviks and an [[Kornilov affair|attempted military coup]] by commanding Gen. [[Lavr Kornilov]] to eliminate the socialists from the provisional government. As the general consensus within the soviets moved leftward, less militant forces began to abandon them, leaving the Bolsheviks in a stronger position. By October, the Bolsheviks were demanding the full transfer of power to the soviets and for total rejection of the Kerensky led provisional government's legitimacy. The provisional government, insistent on maintaining the universally despised war effort on the [[Eastern Front of World War I|Eastern Front]] because of treaty ties with its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and fears of [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German victory]], had become socially isolated and had no enthusiastic support on the streets. On 7 November (25 October, old style), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection which overthrew the Kerensky  provisional government and left the soviets as the sole governing force in Russia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[October Revolution]], the soviets united federally and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], the world's first constitutionally socialist state, was established.{{sfn|Suny|2006|p=xvi}} The Bolsheviks were the majority within the soviets and began to fulfill their campaign promises by signing a damaging peace to end the war with the Germans in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and transferring estates and imperial lands to workers' and peasants' soviets. {{sfn|Suny|2006|p=xvi}} In this context, in 1918, RSDLP(b) became All-Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks). Outside of Russia, social-democrats who supported the soviet government began to identify as communists while those who opposed it retained the social-democratic label.\n\nIn 1921, as the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] was drawing to a close, Lenin proposed the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), a system of state capitalism that started the process of industrialization and post-war recovery.{{sfn|Suny|2006|pp=22\u201324}} The NEP ended a brief period of intense rationing called \"[[war communism]]\" and began a period of a market economy under Communist dictation. The Bolsheviks believed at this time that Russia, being among the most economically undeveloped and socially backward countries in Europe, had not yet reached the necessary conditions of development for socialism to become a practical pursuit and that this would have to wait for such conditions to arrive under capitalist development as had been achieved in more advanced countries such as England and Germany. On 30 December 1922, the Russian SFSR [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] former territories of the Russian Empire to form the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], of which Lenin was elected leader.{{sfn|Suny|2006|p=xvii}} On 9 March 1923, Lenin suffered a stroke, which incapacitated him and effectively ended his role in government. He died on 21 January 1924,{{sfn|Suny|2006|p=xvii}} only thirteen months after the founding of the Soviet Union, of which he would become regarded as the founding father.\n\n===Stalin era (1924\u201353)===\nAfter Lenin's death, a power struggle ensued between [[Joseph Stalin]], the party's [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence]], each with highly contrasting visions for the future direction of the country. Trotsky sought to implement a policy of [[permanent revolution]], which was predicated on the notion that the Soviet Union would not be able to survive in a socialist character when surrounded by hostile governments and therefore concluded that it was necessary to actively support similar revolutions in the more advanced capitalist countries. Stalin, however, argued that such a foreign policy would not be feasible with the capabilities then possessed by the Soviet Union and that it would invite the country's destruction by engaging in armed conflict. Rather, Stalin argued that the Soviet Union should in the meantime pursue peaceful coexistence and invite foreign investment in order to develop the country's economy and build [[socialism in one country]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R80329,_Josef_Stalin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the party from 1924 to his death in 1953]]\n\nUltimately, Stalin gained the greatest support within the party, and Trotsky, who was increasingly viewed as a collaborator with outside forces in an effort to depose Stalin, was isolated and subsequently expelled from the party and exiled from the country in 1928. Stalin's policies henceforth would later become collectively known as [[Stalinism]]. In 1925, the name of the party was changed to the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), reflecting that the republics outside of Russia proper were no longer part of an all-encompassing Russian state. The acronym was usually transliterated as VKP(b), or sometimes VCP(b). Stalin sought to formalize the party's ideological outlook into a philosophical hybrid of the [[Leninism|original ideas of Lenin]] with [[classical Marxism]] into what would be called [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. Stalin's position as General Secretary became the top executive position within the party, giving Stalin significant authority over party and state policy.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, diplomatic relations with western countries were deteriorating to the point that there was growing fear of another allied attack on the Soviet Union. Within the country, the conditions of the NEP had enabled growing inequalities between increasingly wealthy strata and the remaining poor. The combination of these tensions led the party leadership to conclude that it was necessary for the government's survival to pursue a new policy that would centralize economic activity and accelerate industrialization. To do this, the [[first five-year plan]] was implemented in 1928. The plan doubled the industrial workforce, proletarianizing many of the peasants by removing them from their land and assembling them into urban centers. Peasants who remained in agricultural work were also made to have a similarly proletarian relationship to their labor through the policies of [[Agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]], which turned feudal-style farms into collective farms which would be in a cooperative nature under the direction of the state. These two shifts changed the base of Soviet society towards a more working class alignment. The plan was fulfilled ahead of schedule in 1932.\n\nThe success of industrialization in the Soviet Union led western countries, such as the [[United States]], to open diplomatic relations with the Soviet government. In 1933, after years of unsuccessful workers' revolutions (including a short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]) and spiraling economic calamity, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany, violently suppressing the revolutionary organizers and posing a direct threat to the Soviet Union that ideologically supported them. The threat of fascist sabotage and immanent attack greatly exacerbating the already existing tensions within the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. A wave of paranoia overtook Stalin and the party leadership and spread through Soviet society. Seeing potential enemies everywhere, leaders of the government security apparatuses began severe crackdowns known as the [[Great Purge]]. In total, hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were posthumously recognized as innocent, were arrested and either sent to prison camps or executed. Also during this time, a [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928-1941)|campaign against religion]] was waged in which the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which had long been a political arm of tsarism before the revolution, was targeted for repression and organized religion was generally removed from public life and made into a completely private matter, with many churches, mosques and other shrines being repurposed or demolished.\n\nThe Soviet Union was the first to warn of impending danger of invasion from [[Nazi Germany]] to the international community. The western powers, however, remained committed to maintaining peace and avoiding another war breaking out, many considering the Soviet Union's warnings to be an unwanted provocation. While the western governments were mostly committed to neutrality, many western capitalists, notably including the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], secured lucrative business deals with the fascist regimes and had direct interests in maintaining them. After many unsuccessful attempts to create an anti-fascist alliance among the western countries, including trying to rally international support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in its struggle against a fascist military dictatorship supported by Germany and Italy, in 1939 the Soviet Union signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Germany which would be broken in June 1941 when the German military [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in the largest land invasion in history, beginning the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Great Patriotic War]].\n\nThe [[Communist International]] was dissolved in 1943 after it was concluded that such an organization had failed to prevent the rise of fascism and the global war necessary to defeat it. After the 1945 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory of [[World War II]], the Party held to a doctrine of establishing socialist governments in the [[Eastern Bloc|post-war occupied territories]] that would be administered by Communists loyal to Stalin's administration. The party also sought to expand its sphere of influence beyond the occupied territories, using [[proxy wars]] and [[espionage]] and providing training and funding to promote Communist elements abroad, leading to the establishment of the [[Cominform]] in 1947.\n\nIn 1949, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] emerged victorious in the [[Chinese Civil War]], causing an extreme shift in the global balance of forces and greatly escalating tensions between the Communists and the western powers, fueling the [[Cold War]]. In Europe, [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]], acquired the territory of [[Trieste]], causing conflict both with the western powers and with the Stalin administration who opposed such a provocative move. Furthermore, the Yugoslav Communists actively supported the [[Communist Party of Greece|Greek Communists]] during their [[Greek Civil War|civil war]], further frustrating the Soviet government. These tensions led to a [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split]] which marked the beginning of international sectarian division within the world communist movement.\n\n===Post-Stalin years (1953\u201385)===\nAfter Stalin's death, Khrushchev rose to the top post by overcoming political adversaries, including [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]], in a power struggle.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=274\u2013275}} In 1955, Khrushchev achieved the demotion of Malenkov and secured his own position as Soviet leader.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|p=276}} Early in his rule and with the support of several members of the Presidium, Khrushchev initiated the [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], which effectively ended the Stalinist mass terror of the prior decades and reduced socio-economic oppression considerably.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=274\u2013276}} At the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Congress]] held in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes, being careful to omit any reference to complicity by any sitting Presidium members.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=268\u2013269}} His economic policies, while bringing about improvements, were not enough to fix the fundamental problems of the Soviet economy. The standard of living for ordinary citizens did increase; 108 million people moved into new housing between 1956 and 1965.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=278\u2013280}}\n\nKhrushchev's foreign policies led to the [[Sino-Soviet split]], in part a consequence of his public denunciation of Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=282\u2013284}} Khrushchev improved relations with [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] but failed to establish the close, party-to-party relations that he wanted.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=278\u2013280}} While the Thaw reduced political oppression at home, it led to unintended consequences abroad, such as the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and unrest in Poland, where the local citizenry now felt confident enough to rebel against Soviet control.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=284\u2013287}} Khrushchev also failed to improve Soviet relations with the West, partially because of a hawkish military stance.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=284\u2013287}} In the aftermath of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], Khrushchev's position within the party was substantially weakened.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|pp=288\u2013289}} Shortly before his eventual ousting he tried to introduce economic reforms championed by [[Evsei Liberman]], a Soviet economist, which tried to implement market mechanisms into the planned economy.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|p=289}}\n\nKhrushchev was ousted on 14 October 1964 in a Central Committee plenum that officially cited his inability to listen to others, his failure in consulting with the members of the Presidium, his establishment of a cult of personality, his economic mismanagement, and his anti-party reforms as the reasons he was no longer fit to remain as head of the party.{{sfn|Taubman|2006|p=289\u2013290}} He was succeeded in office by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=292}}\n\n[[File:Brezhnev 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era is commonly referred to by historians as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a term coined by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU General Secretary]] Gorbachev{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=292\u2013296}}]]\n\nThe Brezhnev era began with a rejection of [[Khrushchevism]] in virtually every arena except one: continued opposition to Stalinist methods of terror and political violence.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=296\u2013299}} Khrushchev's policies were criticized as voluntarism, and the Brezhnev period saw the rise of [[neo-Stalinism]].{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=297\u2013 298}} While Stalin was never rehabilitated during this period, the most conservative journals in the country were allowed to highlight positive features of his rule.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=297\u2013298}}\n\nAt the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|23rd Congress]] held in 1966, the names of the office of First Secretary and the body of the Presidium reverted to their original names: General Secretary and Politburo, respectively.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=296\u2013297}} At the start of his premiership, Kosygin experimented with economic reforms similar to those championed by Malenkov, including prioritizing light industry over heavy industry to increase the production of consumer goods.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=299}} Similar reforms were introduced in Hungary under the name [[New Economic Mechanism]]; however, with the rise to power of [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]] in Czechoslovakia, who called for the establishment of \"[[socialism with a human face]]\", all non-conformist reform attempts in the Soviet Union were stopped.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=299\u2013230}}\n\nDuring his rule, Brezhnev supported ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'', a passive weakening of animosity with the West with the goal of improving political and economic relations.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=235\u2013238}} However, by the [[25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|25th Congress]] held in 1976, political, economic and social problems within the Soviet Union began to mount and the Brezhnev administration found itself in an increasingly difficult position.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=308}} The previous year, Brezhnev's health began to deteriorate. He became addicted to painkillers and needed to take increasingly more potent medications to attend official meetings.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=309}} Because of the \"[[trust in cadres]]\" policy implemented by his administration, the CPSU leadership evolved into a [[gerontocracy]].{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=309\u2013310}} At the end of Brezhnev's rule, problems continued to amount; in 1979 he consented to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]] to save the embattled [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|communist regime there]] and supported the oppression of the [[Solidarity]] movement in Poland. As problems grew at home and abroad, Brezhnev was increasingly ineffective in responding to the growing criticism of the Soviet Union by Western leaders, most prominently by US Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].{{sfn|Hanson|2006|pp=310\u2013314}} The CPSU, which had wishfully interpreted the [[1973\u201375 recession|financial crisis of the 1970s]] as the beginning of the end of capitalism, found its country falling far behind the West in its economic development.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=313}} Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982, and was succeeded by [[Yuri Andropov]] on 12 November.{{sfn|Hanson|2006|p=315}}\n\nAndropov, a staunch anti-Stalinist, chaired the [[KGB]] during most of Brezhnev's reign.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=316}} He had appointed several reformers to leading positions in the KGB, many of whom later became leading officials under Gorbachev.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=316}} Andropov supported increased openness in the press, particularly regarding the challenges facing the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=317}} Andropov was in office briefly, but he appointed a number of reformers, including [[Yegor Ligachev]], [[Nikolay Ryzhkov]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], to important positions. He also supported a crackdown on absenteeism and corruption.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=317}} Andropov had intended to let Gorbachev succeed him in office, but [[Konstantin Chernenko]] and his supporters suppressed the paragraph in the letter which called for Gorbachev's elevation.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=317}} Andropov died on 9 February 1984 and was succeeded by Chernenko.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=317\u2013318}} Throughout his short leadership, Chernenko was unable to consolidate power and effective control of the party organization remained in Gorbachev's control.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=317\u2013318}} Chernenko died on 10 March 1985 and was succeeded in office by Gorbachev on 11 March 1985.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=317\u2013318}}\n\n===Gorbachev and the party's demise (1985\u201391)===\nGorbachev was elected CPSU General Secretary on 11 March 1985, one day after Chernenko's death.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=319}} When he acceded, the Soviet Union was stagnating but was stable and may have continued largely unchanged into the 21st century if not for Gorbachev's reforms.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=319\u2013320}}\n\nGorbachev conducted a significant personnel reshuffling of the CPSU leadership, forcing old party conservatives out of office.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=320}} In 1985 and early 1986, the new party leadership called for ''[[uskoreniye]]'' ({{lang-ru|acceleration}}).{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=320}} Gorbachev reinvigorated the party ideology by adding new concepts and updating older ones.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=320}} A positive consequence of this was the allowance of \"[[freedom of thought|pluralism of thought]]\" and a call for the establishment of \"[[socialist pluralism]]\" (literally, socialist democracy).{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=322}} He introduced a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (Russian: ''openness'', ''transparency'') in 1986, which led to a wave of unintended democratization.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=323}} According to Russian scholar [[Archie Brown]], the democratization of the Soviet Union brought mixed blessings to Gorbachev; it helped him to weaken his conservative opponents within the party but brought out accumulated grievances which had been oppressed during the previous decades.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=323}} \n[[File:RIAN archive 359290 Mikhail Gorbachev.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last leader of the CPSU and the Soviet Union, as seen in 1986]]\n\nIn reaction to these changes, a conservative movement gained momentum in 1987 in response to [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s dismissal as First Secretary of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Moscow City Committee]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=325}} On 13 March 1988, [[Nina Andreyeva]], a university lecturer, wrote an article titled \"[[I Cannot Forsake My Principles]]\".{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}} The publication was planned to occur when both Gorbachev and his protege [[Alexander Yakovlev (Russian politician)|Alexander Yakovlev]] were visiting foreign countries.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}} In their place, Yegor Ligachev led the party organization and told journalists that the article was \"a benchmark for what we need in our ideology today\".{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}} Upon Gorbachev's return, the article was discussed at length during a Politburo meeting; it was revealed that nearly half of its members were sympathetic to the letter and opposed further reforms which could weaken the party.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}} The meeting lasted for two days, but on 5 April, a Politburo resolution responded with a point-by-point rebuttal to Andreyeva's article.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}}\n\nGorbachev convened the [[19th Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Conference]] in June 1988. He criticized leading party conservatives Ligachev, [[Andrei Gromyko]] and [[Mikhail Solomentsev]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=326}} In turn, conservative delegates attacked Gorbachev and the reformers.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=327}} According to Brown, there had not been as much open discussion and dissent at a party meeting since the early 1920s.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=327}}\n\nDespite the deep-seated opposition for further reform, the CPSU was still hierarchical; the conservatives acceded to Gorbachev's demands because he was the CPSU General Secretary.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=327}} The 19th Conference approved the establishment of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] (CPD) and allowed for contested elections between the CPSU and independent candidates. Organized parties were not allowed.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=327}} The CPD was [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|elected in 1989]]; one-third of the seats were appointed by the CPSU and other public organizations to sustain the Soviet [[one-party state]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=327}} The elections were democratic but most elected CPD members were against any more radical reform.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=327\u2013328}} The elections marked the highest electoral turnout in Russian history; no election before or since had a higher participation rate.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=328}} An organized opposition was established within the legislature under the name [[Inter-Regional Group of Deputies]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=328}} An unintended consequence of these reforms was the increased anti-CPSU pressure; in March 1990 at a session of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], the party was forced to relinquish its political monopoly of power, in effect turning the Soviet Union into a [[liberal democracy]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=329}}\n\nThe CPSU's demise began in March 1990, when party elements were eclipsed in power by state bodies.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=329}} From then until the Soviet Union's disestablishment, Gorbachev ruled the country through the newly created post of [[President of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=329}} Following this, the central party apparatus played little practical role in Soviet affairs.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=329}} Gorbachev had become independent from the Politburo and faced few constraints from party leaders.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=329}} In the summer of 1990, the party convened the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|28th Congress]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=330}} A new Politburo was elected, previous incumbents except Gorbachev and [[Vladimir Ivashko]], the CPSU Deputy General Secretary were removed.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=330}} Later that year, the party began work on a new program with a working title, \"Towards a Humane, Democratic Socialism\".{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=330}} According to Brown, the program reflected Gorbachev's journey from an orthodox communist to a European [[social democracy|social democrat]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=330}} The freedoms of thought and organization, which were allowed by Gorbachev, led to a rise in nationalism in the Soviet republics, indirectly weakening the central authorities.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=344\u2013348}} In response to this, a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum was held in 1991]], in which most of the union republics{{efn|The Soviet Republics of Armenia, Estonia and Georgia all boycotted the 1991 referendum.}} voted to preserve the union in a [[Union of Sovereign States|different form]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=344\u2013348}} In reaction to this, conservative elements within the CPSU launched the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 coup]], which overthrew Gorbachev but failed to preserve the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=344\u2013348}} When Gorbachev returned after the coup's collapse, he resigned from the CPSU and operations were handed over to Ivashko.{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=344\u2013349}} The CPSU was outlawed on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory, extended its further ban on 6 November on Russian soil by Yeltsin and Gorbachev resigned from the presidency on 25 December; the following day the Soviet Union was dissolved.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=349}}\n\nOn 30 November 1992; the Russian Constitutional Court not only upheld this decree, but barred the CPSU from ever being refounded. It accepted Yeltsin's argument that the CPSU was not a true party, but a criminal organisation that had ruled the Soviet Union as a dictatorship in violation of the Soviet Constitution.\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia. Additionally, the CPRF was initially founded as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Communist Party of the Russian SFSR]] in 1990, some time before CPSU was abolished and was seen as a \"Russian-nationalist\" counterpart to CPSU.\n\n==Governing style==\n{{Main|Collective leadership in the Soviet Union}}\nThe style of governance in the party alternated between collective leadership and a [[cult of personality]]. Collective leadership split power between the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], the Central Committee, and the Council of Ministers to hinder any attempts to create a one-man dominance over the Soviet political system. By contrast, Stalin's period as leader was characterised by [[Stalin's cult of personality|an extensive cult of personality]]. Regardless of leadership style, all political power in the Soviet Union was concentrated in the organization of the CPSU.\n\n===Democratic centralism===\n{{Main|Democratic centralism}}\nDemocratic centralism is an organizational principle conceived by Lenin.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} According to Soviet pronouncements, democratic centralism was distinguished from \"[[bureaucratic]] centralism\", which referred to high-handed formulae without knowledge or discussion.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} In democratic centralism, decisions are taken after discussions but once the general party line has been formed, discussion on the subject must cease.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} No member or organizational institution may dissent on a policy after it has been agreed upon by the party's governing body; to do so would lead to expulsion from the party (formalized at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]]).{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} Because of this stance, Lenin initiated a [[Ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|ban on factions]], which was approved at the 10th Congress.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=187}}\n\nLenin believed that democratic centralism safeguarded both party unity and ideological correctness.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} He conceived of the system after the events of 1917, when several socialist parties \"deformed\" themselves and actively began supporting nationalist sentiments.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=183\u2013184}} Lenin intended that the devotion to policy required by centralism would protect the parties from such [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] ills and bourgeois defamation of socialism.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=183\u2013184}} Lenin supported the notion of a highly centralized vanguard party, in which ordinary party members elected the local party committee, the local party committee elected the regional committee, the regional committee elected the Central Committee and the Central Committee elected the Politburo, Orgburo and the Secretariat.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} Lenin believed that the party needed to be ruled from the centre and have at its disposal power to mobilize party members at will.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=186}} This system was later introduced in communist parties abroad through the [[Communist International]] (Comintern).{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=187}}\n\n===Vanguardism===\n{{Main|Vanguardism}}\nA central tenet of Leninism was that of the vanguard party.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=179}} In a capitalist society, the party was to represent the interests of the working class and all of those who were exploited by capitalism in general; however, it was not to become a part of that class.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=179}} Lenin decided that the party's sole responsibility was to articulate and plan the long-term interests of the oppressed classes. It was not responsible for the daily grievances of those classes; that was the responsibility of the [[trade union]]s.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=179}} According to Lenin, the Party and the oppressed classes could never become one because the Party was responsible for leading the oppressed classes to victory.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=181}} The basic idea was that a small group of organized people could wield power disproportionate to their size with superior organizational skills.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=181}} Despite this, until the end of his life, Lenin warned of the danger that the party could be taken over by bureaucrats, by a small clique, or by an individual.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=181}} Toward the end of his life, he criticized the bureaucratic inertia of certain officials and admitted to problems with some of the party's control structures, which were to supervise organizational life.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=181}}\n\n==Organization==\n{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\n\n===Congress===\n{{Main|Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nThe Congress, nominally the highest organ of the party, was convened every five years.{{sfn|Smith|1988|p=71}} Leading up to the October Revolution and until Stalin's consolidation of power, the Congress was the party's main decision-making body.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=1}} However, after Stalin's ascension the Congresses became largely symbolic.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=1}} CPSU leaders used Congresses as a propaganda and control tool.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=1}} The most noteworthy Congress since the 1930s was the 20th Congress, in which Khrushchev denounced Stalin in a speech titled \"[[The Personality Cult and its Consequences]]\".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=1}}\n\nDespite delegates to Congresses losing their powers to criticize or remove party leadership, the Congresses functioned as a form of [[Mass communications|elite-mass communication]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=2}} They were occasions for the party leadership to express the [[party line (politics)|party line]] over the next five years to ordinary CPSU members and the general public.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=2}} The information provided was general, ensuring that party leadership retained the ability to make specific policy changes as they saw fit.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=2}}\n\nThe Congresses also provided the party leadership with formal legitimacy by providing a mechanism for the election of new members and the retirement of old members who had lost favour.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=3}} The elections at Congresses were all predetermined and the candidates who stood for seats to the Central Committee and the [[Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Auditing Commission]] were approved beforehand by the Politburo and the Secretariat.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=3}} A Congress could also provide a platform for the announcement of new ideological concepts.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1977|p=3}} For instance, at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Congress]], Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would see \"[[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]\"{{mdash}}{{sfn|Evans|1993|pp=62\u201364}} a position later retracted.\n\nA Conference, officially referred to as an All-Union Conference, was convened between Congresses by the Central

Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nThe Central Committee was a [[Collectivism|collective body]] elected at the annual [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|party congress]].{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=455}} It was mandated to meet at least twice a year to act as the party's supreme governing body.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=455}} Membership of the Central Committee increased from 71 full members in 1934 to 287 in 1976.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|pp=455\u2013456}} Central Committee members were elected to the seats because of the offices they held, not on their personal merit.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=458}} Because of this, the Central Committee was commonly considered an indicator for [[Sovietologist]]s to study the strength of the different institutions.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=458}} The Politburo was elected by and reported to the Central Committee.{{sfn|Getty|1987|pp=25\u201326}} Besides the Politburo, the Central Committee also elected the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretariat]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]{{mdash}}the ''de facto'' leader of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Getty|1987|pp=25\u201326}} In 1919\u20131952, the [[Orgburo]] was also elected in the same manner as the Politburo and the Secretariat by the plenums of the Central Committee.{{sfn|Getty|1987|pp=25\u201326}} In between Central Committee plenums, the Politburo and the Secretariat were legally empowered to make decisions on its behalf.{{sfn|Getty|1987|pp=25\u201326}} The Central Committee or the Politburo and/or Secretariat on its behalf could issue nationwide decisions; decisions on behalf of the party were transmitted from the top to the bottom.{{sfn|Getty|1987|p=27}}\n\nUnder Lenin, the Central Committee functioned much like the Politburo did during the post-Stalin era, serving as the party's governing body.{{sfn|Sakwa|1998|p=93}} However, as the membership in the Central Committee increased, its role was eclipsed by the Politburo.{{sfn|Sakwa|1998|p=93}} Between Congresses, the Central Committee functioned as the Soviet leadership's source of legitimacy.{{sfn|Sakwa|1998|p=93}} The decline in the Central Committee's standing began in the 1920s; it was reduced to a compliant body of the Party leadership during the Great Purge.{{sfn|Sakwa|1998|p=93}} According to party rules, the Central Committee was to convene at least twice a year to discuss political matters{{mdash}}but not matters relating to military policy.{{sfn|Sakwa|1998|p=94}} The body remained largely symbolic after Stalin's consolidation; leading party officials rarely attended meetings of the Central Committee.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=462}}\n\n====Central Auditing Commission====\n{{Main|Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nThe Central Auditing Commission (CAC) was elected by the party Congresses and reported only to the party Congress.<ref name=\"caccpsu\">{{cite web |work= [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] |author = [[Staff writer]] |url=

Rules, Charter and Constitution) was the party's by-laws and controlled life within the CPSU.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=393}} The 1st Statute was adopted at the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]{{mdash}}the forerunner of the CPSU.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=393}} How the Statute was to be structured and organized led to a schism within the party, leading to the establishment of two competing factions; [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)|Bolsheviks]] (literally ''majority'') and [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks)|Mensheviks]] (literally ''minority'').{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=393}} The 1st Statute was based upon Lenin's idea of a centralized vanguard party.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=393}} The [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|4th Congress]], despite a majority of Menshevik delegates, added the concept of [[democratic centralism]] to Article 2 of the Statute.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=394}} The 1st Statute lasted until 1919, when the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|8th Congress]] adopted the 2nd Statute.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=396}} It was nearly five times as long as the 1st Statute and contained 66 articles.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=396}} It was amended at the [[9th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|9th Congress]]. At the [[11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|11th Congress]], the 3rd Statute was adopted with only minor amendments being made.{{sfn|Simons|1984|p=398}} New statutes were approved at the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|17th]] and [[18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|18th Congresses]] respectively.{{sfn|Simons|1984|pp=399\u2013404}} The last party statute, which existed until the dissolution of the CPSU, was adopted at the 22nd Congress.{{sfn|Simons|1984|pp=404\u2013408}}\n\n===Central Committee apparatus===\n{{Main|Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\n\n====General Secretary====\n{{Further|General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nGeneral Secretary of the Central Committee was the title given to the overall leader of the party. The office was synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power in the 1920s. Stalin used the office of General Secretary to create a strong power base for himself. The office was formally titled ''First Secretary'' between 1952 and 1966.\n\n====Politburo====\n{{Main|Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\n[[File:Execute 346 Politburo passes.jpg|thumb|A [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] resolution to execute 346 \"enemies of the CPSU and Soviet Power\" who led \"[[counter-revolutionary]], [[Trotskyism|right-trotskyite]], plotting and spying activities\" (signed by Stalin)]]\nThe Political Bureau (Politburo), known as the Presidium from 1952 to 1966, was the highest party organ when the Congress and the Central Committee were not in session.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=85}} Until the 19th Conference in 1988, the Politburo alongside the Secretariat controlled appointments and dismissals nationwide.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=98}} In the post-Stalin period, the Politburo controlled the Central Committee apparatus through two channels; the [[General Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Department]] distributed the Politburo's orders to the Central Committee departments and through the personnel overlap which existed within the Politburo and the Secretariat.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=98}} This personnel overlap gave the CPSU General Secretary a way of strengthening his position within the Politburo through the Secretariat.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=99}} [[Kirill Mazurov]], Politburo member from 1965 to 1978, accused Brezhnev of turning the Politburo into a \"second echelon\" of power.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=99}} He accomplished this by discussing policies before Politburo meetings with [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]], [[Fyodor Kulakov]] and [[Dmitriy Ustinov]] among others, who held seats both in the Politburo and the Secretariat.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=99}} Mazurov's claim was later verified by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the Chairman of the Council of Ministers under Gorbachev. Ryzhkov said that Politburo meetings lasted only 15 minutes because the people close to Brezhnev had already decided what was to be approved.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=99}}\n\nThe Politburo was abolished and replaced by a Presidium in 1952 at the 19th Congress.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|pp=37\u201338}} In the aftermath the 19th Congress and the 1st Plenum of the [[19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Central Committee]], Stalin ordered the creation of the [[Bureau of the Presidium]], which acted as the standing committee of the Presidium.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=38}} On 6 March 1953, one day after Stalin's death, a new and smaller Presidium was elected and the Bureau of the Presidium was abolished in a joint session with the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] and the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=45}}\n\nUntil 1990, the CPSU General Secretary acted as the informal chairman of the Politburo.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=101}} During the first decades of the CPSU's existence, the Politburo was officially chaired by the Chairman of the [[Council of People's Commissars]]; first by Lenin, then by [[Aleksey Rykov]], Molotov, Stalin and Malenkov.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=101}} After 1922, when Lenin was incapacitated, [[Lev Kamenev]] as Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars chaired the Politburo's meetings.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=101}} This tradition lasted until Khrushchev's consolidation of power.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=101}} In the first post-Stalin years, when Malenkov chaired Politburo meetings, Khrushchev as First Secretary signed all Central Committee documents into force.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=101}} From 1954 until 1958, Khrushchev chaired the Politburo as First Secretary but in 1958 he dismissed and succeeded [[Nikolai Bulganin]] as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=102}} During this period, the informal position of Second Secretary{{mdash}}later formalized as Deputy General Secretary{{mdash}}was established.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=102}} The Second Secretary became responsible for chairing the Secretariat in place of the General Secretary. When the General Secretary could not chair the meetings of the Politburo, the Second Secretary would take his place.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=102}} This system survived until the dissolution of the CPSU in 1991.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=102}}\n\nTo be elected to the Politburo, a member had to serve in the Central Committee.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}} The Central Committee elected the Politburo in the aftermath of a party Congress.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}} Members of the Central Committee were given a predetermined list of candidates for the Politburo having only one candidate for each seat; for this reason the election of the Politburo was usually passed unanimously.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}} The greater the power held by the sitting CPSU General Secretary, the higher the chance that the Politburo membership would be approved.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}}\n\n====Secretariat====\n{{Main|Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nThe Secretariat headed the CPSU's central apparatus and was solely responsible for the development and implementation of party policies.{{sfn|Getty|1987|p=26}} It was legally empowered to take over the duties and functions of the Central Committee when it was not in plenum (did not hold a meeting).{{sfn|Getty|1987|p=26}} Many members of the Secretariat concurrently held a seat in the Politburo.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=430}} According to a Soviet textbook on party procedures, the Secretariat's role was that of \"leadership of current work, chiefly in the realm of personnel selection and in the organization of the verification of fulfilment of party-state decisions\".{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=430}} \"Selections of personnel\" ({{lang-ru|podbor kadrov}}) in this instance meant the maintenance of general standards and the criteria for selecting various personnel. \"Verification of fulfillment\" ({{lang-ru|proverka ispolneniia}}) of party and state decisions meant that the Secretariat instructed other bodies.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=432}}\n\nThe powers of the Secretariat were weakened under Mikhail Gorbachev and the Central Committee Commissions took over the functions of the Secretariat in 1988.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=185}} Yegor Ligachev, a Secretariat member, said that the changes completely destroyed the Secretariat's hold on power and made the body almost superfluous.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=185}} Because of this, the Secretariat rarely met during the next two years.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=185}} It was revitalized at the 28th Party Congress in 1990 and the Deputy General Secretary became the official Head of the Secretariat.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=121}}\n\n====Orgburo====\n{{Main|Orgburo}}\nThe Organizational Bureau, or Orgburo, existed from 1919 to 1952 and was one of three leading bodies of the party when the Central Committee was not in session.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=85}} It was responsible for \"organizational questions, the recruitment and allocation of personnel, the coordination of activities of party, government and social organizations (e.g. trade unions and youth organizations), improvement to the party's structure, the distribution of information and reports within the party\".{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}} The 19th Congress abolished the Orgburo and its duties and responsibilities were taken over by the Secretariat.{{sfn|Lowenhardt|van Ree|Ozinga|1992|p=87}} At the beginning, the Orgburo held three meetings a week and reported to the Central Committee every second week.{{sfn|Eaton|2004|p=58}} Lenin described the relation between the Politburo and the Orgburo as \"the Orgburo allocates forces, while the Politburo decides policy\".{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=81}} A decision of the Orgburo was implemented by the Secretariat.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=81}} However, the Secretariat could make decisions in the Orgburo's name without consulting its members but if one Orgburo member objected to a Secretariat resolution, the resolution would not be implemented.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=81}} In the 1920s, if the Central Committee could not convene the Politburo and the Orgburo would hold a joint session in its place.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=81}}\n\n====Control Commission====\n{{Main|Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nThe Central Control Commission (CCC) functioned as the party's supreme court.{{sfn|Fainsod|Hough|1979|p=249}} The CCC was established at the [[9th All-Russian Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|9th All-Russian Conference]] in September 1920, but rules organizing its procedure were not enacted before the 10th Congress.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=83}} The 10th Congress formally established the CCC on all party levels and stated that it could only be elected at a party congress or a party conference.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=83}} The CCC and the CCs were formally independent but had to make decisions through the party committees at their level, which led them in practice to lose their administrative independence.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=83}} At first, the primary responsibility of the CCs was to respond to party complaints, focusing mostly on party complaints of [[Political faction|factionalism]] and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratism]].{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=84}} At the 11th Congress, the brief of the CCs was expanded; it become responsible for overseeing [[party line (politics)|party discipline]].{{sfn|Gill|2002|pp=84\u201385}} In a bid to further centralize the powers of the CCC, a Presidium of the CCC, which functioned in a similar manner to the Politburo in relation to the Central Committee, was established in 1923.{{sfn|Gill|2002|pp=167}} At the 18th Congress, party rules regarding the CCC were changed; it was now elected by the Central Committee and was subordinate to the Central Committee.{{sfn|Eisen|1990|p=246}}\n\nCCC members could not concurrently be members of the Central Committee.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=95}} To create an organizational link between the CCC and other central-level organs, the 9th All-Russian Conference created the joint CC\u2013CCC plenums.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=95}} The CCC was a powerful organ; the 10th Congress allowed it to expel full and candidate Central Committee members and members of their subordinate organs if two thirds of attendants at a CC\u2013CCC plenum voted for such.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=95}} At its first such session in 1921, Lenin tried to persuade the joint plenum to expel [[Alexander Shliapnikov]] from the party;

During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members.

The vanguard party would know what was best for the workers because the party functionaries had attained consciousness.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}}\n\nLenin, in light of the [[Marx's theory of the state]] (which views the state as an oppressive organ of the ruling class), had no qualms of forcing change upon the country.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} He viewed the dictatorship of the proletariat, rather than the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, to be the dictatorship of the majority.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} The repressive powers of the state were to be used to transform the country, and to strip of the former ruling class of their wealth.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} Lenin believed that the transition from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the [[socialist mode of production]] would last for a long period.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=77}} According to some authors, Leninism was by definition authoritarian.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=76}} In contrast to Marx, who believed that the [[socialist revolution]] would comprise and be led by the working class alone, Lenin argued that a socialist revolution did not necessarily need to be led or to comprise the working class alone.

But this contradiction springs from life itself and reflects completely Marxist dialectic.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=79}}</blockquote>\n\nAt the 1939 18th Congress, Stalin abandoned the idea that the state would wither away.

[[Afar language|Afar]], [[Agaw languages|Agaw]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]]). [[Leo Reinisch]] subsequently grouped Beja with Saho-Afar, Somali and Oromo in a Lowland Cushitic sub-phylum, representing one half of a two-fold partition of Cushitic. Moreno (1940) proposed a bipartite classification of Beja similar to that of Reinisch, but lumped Beja with both Lowland Cushitic and Central Cushitic. Around the same period, [[Enrico Cerulli]] (c. 1950) asserted that Beja constituted an independent sub-group of Cushitic. During the 1960s, Archibald N. Tucker (1960) posited an ''orthodox'' branch of Cushitic that comprised Beja, East Cushitic and Agaw, and a ''fringe'' branch of Cushitic that included other languages in the phylum. Although also similar to Reinisch's paradigm, Tucker's orthodox-fringe dichotomy was predicated on a different typological approach. Andrzej Zaborski (1976) suggested, on the basis of genetic features, that Beja constituted the only member of the North Cushitic sub-phylum.<ref name=\"Vanhove2016\">{{cite web|last1=Vanhove|first1=Martine|title=North-Cushitic|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01485896/document|publisher=LLACAN, CNRS-INALCO, Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris-Cit\u00e9|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> Due to its linguistic innovations, [[Robert Hetzron]] (1980) argued that Beja may constitute an independent branch of the Afroasiatic family.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hetzron |first1=Robert| date=1980 |title=The limits of Cushitic |journal=Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika |volume=2 |pages=7\u2013126 }}</ref> Hetzron's suggestion was arrived at independently,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ekkehard Wolff, Hilke Meyer-Bahlburg|title=Studies in Chadic and Afroasiatic linguistics: papers from the International Colloquium on the Chadic Language Family and the Symposium on Chadic within Afroasiatic, at the University of Hamburg, September 14-18, 1981|date=1983|publisher=H.

Appleyard (2004) later also demonstrated that the innovations in Beja, which Hetzron had identified, were centered on a typological argument involving a presumed change in syntax and also consisted of only five differing Cushitic morphological features. Marcello Lamberti (1991) elucidated Cerulli's traditional classification of Beja, juxtaposing the language as the North Cushitic branch alongside three other independent Cushitic sub-phyla, Lowland Cushitic, Central Cushitic and Sidama. Didier Morin (2001) assigned Beja to Lowland Cushitic on the grounds that the language shared lexical and phonological features with the Afar and Saho idioms, and also because the languages were historically spoken in adjacent speech areas. However, among linguists specializing in the Cushitic languages, Cerulli's traditional paradigm is accepted as the standard classification for Beja.<ref name=\"Vanhove2016\"/>\n\nThere are also a few poorly-classified languages, including [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]], [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], [[Asa language|Aasax]], [[Kw'adza language|Kw'adza]], [[Boon language|Boon]], the Cushitic element of [[Mbugu language|Mbugu]] (Ma'a) and [[Ongota language|Ongota]]. There is a wide range of opinions as to how the languages are interrelated.<ref name=Hayward>Richard Hayward, \"Afroasiatic\", in Heine & Nurse, 2000, ''African Languages''</ref>\n\nThe positions of the Dullay languages and of Yaaku are uncertain. They have traditionally been assigned to an East Cushitic branch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward thinks that East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic.<ref name=Hayward/>\n\nThe Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, because of the \"mixed\" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota is a separate branch of Afroasiatic.<ref>[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag \u2013 The Harrassowitz Publishing House<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Bonny Sands (2009) thinks the most convincing proposal is by Sav\u00e0 and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]].

However, this view has been abandoned. Omotic is generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of [[Harold C.

In Chapter 11, unless a separate trustee is appointed for cause, the debtor, as debtor in possession, acts as trustee of the business.<ref>{{usc|11|1107}}</ref>\n\nChapter 11 affords the debtor in possession a number of mechanisms to restructure its business. A debtor in possession can acquire financing and [[loan]]s on favorable terms by giving new lenders first priority on the business's earnings. The court may also permit the debtor in possession to reject and cancel contracts. Debtors are also protected from other litigation against the business through the imposition of an [[automatic stay]]. While the automatic stay is in place, creditors are stayed from any collection attempts or activities against the debtor in possession, and most litigation against the debtor is stayed,<ref name=\"law.cornell.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|title=11 U.S. Code \u00a7 362 - Automatic stay|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> or put on hold, until it can be resolved in bankruptcy court, or resumed in its original venue.  An example of proceedings that are not necessarily stayed automatically are family law proceedings against a spouse or parent.  Further, creditors may file with the court seeking relief from the automatic stay.\n\nIf the business is [[insolvent]], its debts exceed its assets and the business is unable to pay debts as they come due,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201#Insolvent|title=\u00a7 1-201. General Definitions.|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> the bankruptcy restructuring may result in the company's owners being left with nothing; instead, the owners' rights and interests are ended and the company's creditors are left with ownership of the newly reorganized company.\n\nAll creditors are entitled to be heard by the court.<ref>1 U.S.C. Sec. 1109 (b)</ref> The court is ultimately responsible for determining whether the proposed plan of reorganization complies with the bankruptcy law.\n\nOne controversy that has broken out in bankruptcy courts concerns the proper amount of disclosure that the court and other parties are entitled to receive from the members of the ad hoc creditor's committees that play a large role in many such proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/166ef296-0abb-11df-b35f-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html|title=Bankruptcy Rules Committee rethinks 2019 pricing disclosure amid HF panic attack|work=Financial Times|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Chapter 11 plan===\nChapter 11 usually results in reorganization of the debtor's business or personal assets and debts, but can also be used as a mechanism for liquidation. Debtors may \"emerge\" from a chapter 11 bankruptcy within a few months or within several years, depending on the size and complexity of the bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code accomplishes this objective through the use of a bankruptcy plan. The debtor in possession typically has the first opportunity to propose a plan during the period of exclusivity. This period allows the debtor 120 days from the date of filing for chapter 11, to propose a plan of reorganization before any other party in interest may propose a plan. If the debtor proposes a plan within the 120-day exclusivity period, a 180-day exclusivity period from the date of filing for chapter 11 is granted in order to allow the debtor to gain confirmation of the proposed plan.<ref name=\"law.cornell.edu\"/>  With some exceptions, the plan may be proposed by any party in interest.<ref>{{usc|11|1121}}</ref> Interested creditors then vote for a plan.\n\n===Confirmation===\nIf the judge approves the reorganization plan and the creditors all agree, then the plan can be confirmed.  If at least one class of creditors objects and votes against the plan, it may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of [[cramdown]] are met.  In order to be confirmed over the creditors' objection, the plan must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and the plan must be found fair and equitable to that class.  Upon confirmation, the plan becomes binding and identifies the treatment of debts and operations of the business for the duration of the plan.  If a plan cannot be confirmed, the court may either convert the case to a liquidation under chapter 7, or, if in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, the case may be dismissed resulting in a return to the status quo before bankruptcy.  If the case is dismissed, creditors will look to non-bankruptcy law in order to satisfy their claims.\n\n===Automatic stay===\nLike other forms of bankruptcy, petitions filed under chapter 11 invoke the [[automatic stay]] of [http://www.bknevada.com/index.php/chapter-3-case-administration/subchapter-iv-administrative-powers/362-automatic-stay \u00a7 362]. The automatic stay requires all creditors to cease collection attempts, and makes many post-petition debt collection efforts void or voidable. Under some circumstances, some creditors, otherwise the [[United States Trustee]] can request for the court converting the case into a liquidation under chapter 7, or appointing a trustee to manage the debtor's business. The court will grant a motion to convert to chapter 7 or appoint a trustee if either of these actions is in the best interest of all creditors. Sometimes a company will liquidate under chapter 11, in which the pre-existing management may be able to help get a higher price for divisions or other assets than a chapter 7 liquidation would be likely to achieve. Appointment of a trustee requires some wrongdoing or gross mismanagement on the part of existing management and is relatively rare.\n\n===Executory contracts===\nSome contracts, known as [[executory contracts]], may be rejected if canceling them would be financially favorable to the company and its creditors. Such contracts may include labor union contracts, supply or operating contracts (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory contracts is that each party to the contract has duties remaining under the contract. In the event of a rejection, the remaining parties to the contract become unsecured creditors of the debtor. For example, in some districts a [[contract for deed]] is an executory contract, while in others it is not.\n\nIn the new millennium airlines have fallen under intense scrutiny for what many see as abusing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as a simple tool for escaping labor contracts, usually 30-35% of an airline's operating cost.<ref>{{cite web|title=massachusetts institute of technology: Airline Data Project|url=http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/Employees&Compensation.html|publisher=MIT}}</ref> Every major US airline has filed for Chapter 11 since 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Richard|title=AMR Files for Bankruptcy: The Last Giant to Fall|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/american-airlines-plunges-into-bankruptcy/|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=Nov 29, 2011}}</ref> In the space of 2 years (2002 - 2004) US.

The priority structure is defined primarily by \u00a7 507 of the Bankruptcy Code ({{usc|11|507}}.)\n\nAs a general rule, administrative expenses (the actual, necessary expenses of preserving the bankruptcy estate, including expenses such as employee wages, and the cost of litigating the chapter 11 case) are paid first.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/503|title=11 U.S. Code \u00a7 503 - Allowance of administrative expenses|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> [[Secured creditor]]s\u2014creditors who have a [[security interest]], or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], in the debtor's property\u2014will be paid before unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors' claims are prioritized by \u00a7 507. For instance the claims of suppliers of products or employees of a company may be paid before other unsecured creditors are paid. Each priority level must be paid in full before the next lower priority level may receive payment.\n\n===Section 1110===\nSection 1110 ({{usc|11|1110}}) generally provides a secured party with an interest in an aircraft the ability to take possession of the equipment within 60 days after a bankruptcy filing unless the airline cures all defaults. More specifically, the right of the lender to take possession of the secured equipment is not hampered by the automatic stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\n==Stock==\nIf the company's stock is publicly traded, a Chapter 11 filing generally causes it to be [[delisting (stock)|delisted]] from its primary stock exchange if listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the [[American Stock Exchange]], or the [[NASDAQ]]. On the NASDAQ the identifying fifth letter \"Q\" at the end of a stock symbol indicates the company is in bankruptcy (formerly the \"Q\" was placed in front of the pre-existing stock symbol; a celebrated example was [[Penn Central]], whose symbol was originally \"PC\" and became \"QPC\" after the company filed Chapter 11 in 1970). Many stocks that are delisted quickly resume listing as [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) stocks. Actual share value does not reach zero unless the probability of restructuring is so low that a Chapter 7 filing is sure to follow.\n\nIndividuals may file Chapter 11, but due to the complexity and expense of the proceeding, this option is rarely chosen by debtors who are eligible for Chapter 7 or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] relief.\n\n==Rationale==\nIn enacting Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code, Congress concluded that it is sometimes the case that the value of a business is greater if sold or reorganized as a [[going concern]] than the value of the sum of its parts if the business's assets were to be sold off individually. It follows that it may be more economically efficient to allow a troubled company to continue running, cancel some of its debts, and give ownership of the newly reorganized company to the creditors whose debts were canceled. Alternatively, the business can be sold as a going concern with the net proceeds of the sale distributed to creditors ratably in accordance with statutory priorities. In this way, jobs may be saved, the (previously mismanaged) engine of profitability which is the business is maintained (presumably under better management) rather than being dismantled, and, as a proponent of a chapter 11 plan is required to demonstrate as a precursor to plan confirmation, the business's creditors end up with more money than they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation.\n\n==Considerations==\nThe reorganization and court process may take an inordinate amount of time, limiting the chances of a successful outcome and sufficient debtor in possession financing may be unavailable during an economic recession. A preplanned, preagreed approach between the debtor and its creditors (sometimes called a pre-packaged bankruptcy) may facilitate the desired result. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the \"protection\" of the court until it emerges. An example is the [[airline industry]] in the United States; in 2006 over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.<ref>{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}</ref> These airlines were able to stop making debt payments, break their previously agreed upon labor union contracts, freeing up cash to expand routes or weather a price war against competitors &mdash; all with the bankruptcy court's approval.\n\nStudies on the impact of forestalling the creditors' rights to enforce their security reach different conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1494270|title=The night of the killer zombies|work=Economist.com|date=2002-12-12|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==Deadlines==\nWithin 60 days of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor must submit a written disclosure statement with the court containing information on assets, liabilities and business affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcdmlawgroup.com/2014/02/3-deadlines-beware-filing-chapter-11-bankruptcy/|title=3 Deadlines to Beware of When Filing a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|work=DCDM|date=2014-02-17|accessdate=2014-10-15}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{see also|Category:Companies that have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy}}\n\n===Frequency===\nChapter 11 cases dropped by 60% from 1991 to 2003. One 2007 study<ref name=\"WSJSpurn\">(January 24, 2007), \"Small Firms Spurn Chapter 11\", ''Wall Street Journal'', page B6B</ref> found this was because businesses were turning to bankruptcy-like proceedings under state law, rather than the federal bankruptcy proceedings, including those under chapter 11. Insolvency proceedings under state law, the study stated, are currently faster, less expensive, and more private, with some states not even requiring court filings. However, a 2005 study<ref name=\"WSJSpurn\"/> claimed the drop may have been due to an increase in the incorrect classification of many bankruptcies as \"consumer cases\" rather than \"business cases\".\n\nCases involving more than US$50 million in assets are almost always handled in federal bankruptcy court, and not in bankruptcy-like state proceeding.\n\n===Largest cases===\nThe [[Bankruptcy in the United States|largest bankruptcy]] in history was of the US investment bank [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.]], which listed $639 billion in assets as of its Chapter 11 filing in 2008.

Controversial issues are held as potentially divisive in a given society, because they can lead to tension and ill will, and as a result they are often considered [[taboo]] to be discussed in the light of company in many cultures.\n\n==Legal==\n\n{{Main article|Controversy (law)}}\nIn the [[jurisprudence|theory of law]], a controversy differs from a [[legal case]]; while legal cases include all suits, [[crime|criminal]] as well as [[civil law (common law)|civil]], a controversy is a purely civil proceeding.\n\nFor example, the [[Case or Controversy Clause]] of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] ([[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury|Section 2]], Clause 1) states that \"the judicial Power shall extend&nbsp;...&nbsp;to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party\". This clause has been deemed to impose a requirement that United States federal courts are not permitted to hear cases that do not pose an actual controversy&mdash;that is, an actual dispute between adverse parties which is capable of being resolved by the [court]. In addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, it also prohibits courts from issuing [[advisory opinion]]s, or from hearing cases that are either [[ripeness|unripe]], meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or [[mootness|moot]], meaning that the controversy has already been  resolved.\n\n==Benford's law==\n{{Main article|Gregory Benford#Benford's law of controversy|l1=Benford's law of controversy}}\n\n[[Gregory Benford#Benford's law of controversy|Benford's law of controversy]], as expressed by the astrophysicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] in 1980, states: ''[[Passion (emotion)|Passion]] is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the amount of real [[information]] available.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/Misc/EFF/?f=quotes.eff.txt |title=EFF Quotes Collection 19.6 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=2001-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822143815/http://www.sysprog.net/quotlaws.html |archivedate=2008-08-22|url=http://www.sysprog.net/quotlaws.html|title=Quotations: Computer Laws |work=SysProg |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> In other words, it claims that the less factual information is available on a topic, the more controversy can arise around that topic \u2013 and the more facts are available, the less controversy can arise. Thus, for example, controversies in physics would be limited to subject areas where experiments cannot be carried out yet, whereas controversies would be inherent to politics, where communities must frequently decide on courses of action based on insufficient information.\n\n==Psychological bases==\n\nControversies are frequently thought to be a result of a lack of confidence on the part of the disputants \u2013 as implied by [[Gregory Benford#Benford's law of controversy|Benford's law of controversy]], which only talks about lack of information (\"passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available\"). For example, in analyses of the political controversy over [[anthropogenic climate change]], which is exceptionally virulent in the [[United States]], it has been proposed that those who are opposed to the scientific consensus do so because they don't have enough information about the topic.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 297\u2013312| last = Ungar| first = S.| title = Knowledge, ignorance and the popular culture: climate change versus the ozone hole| journal = Public Understanding of Science| year = 2000 | doi = 10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/306}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 35\u201341| last = Pidgeon| first = N.|author2=B.

In addition, the preferences of the agent (the particular rewards that they value) also cause the beliefs formed to change \u2013 this explains the biased assimilation (also known as [[confirmation bias]]) shown above. This model allows the production of controversy to be seen as a consequence of a decision maker optimized for single-step decision making, rather than as a result of limited reasoning in the [[bounded rationality]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]].\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Controversy.ogg|2013-06-27}}\n\n*[[Argument]]\n*[[Bipartisanship]]\n*[[Dialectic]]\n*[[ProCon.org]]\n*[[Scandal]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|controversy}}\n* [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]], ''[http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/14cm/14cm.pdf The Controversy Manual]'' (Sparsn\u00e4s, Sweden: Irene Publishing, 2014).\n* [https://www.semanticjuice.com/controversial-topics/ Controversial topics] based on [[machine learning]] on Wikipedia data\n* [https://controversial.today/ Controversial Today]\n\n[[Category:English words]]", "sha1": "5sf3euktqo4h4qd22ikk3y76wak0djn"}}, {"title": "Centromere", "ns": "0", "id": "7284", "revision": {"id": "865231275", "parentid": "865086825", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T16:21:35Z", "contributor": {"ip": "171.48.110.35"}, "comment": "That there are one arm present in telocentric", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More footnotes|article|date=May 2011}}\n[[Image:Chromosome.svg|thumb|In this diagram of a duplicated chromosome, (2) identifies the centromere\u2014the region that joins the two [[sister chromatids]], or each half of the chromosome.

Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' to humans, have regional centromeres.\n\nRegarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical [[sister chromatids]] are most closely in contact. When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication in chromatin form) are linked along their length by the action of the [[cohesin]] complex. It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=sisterchromatidcohesion |title=Sister chromatid cohesion |date=May 15, 2011 |work=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]}}</ref>\n\n== Positions ==\n[[File:Centromere Placement.svg|thumb|'''Classifications of Chromosomes'''<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n| '''I''' || Telocentric || Centromere placement very close to the top, p arms barely visible if visible at all.\n|-\n| '''II''' || Acrocentric || q arms are still much longer than the p arms, but the p arms are longer than those in telocentric.\n|-\n| '''III''' || Submetacentric || p and q arms are very close in length but not equal.\n|-\n| '''IV''' || Metacentric || p and q arms are equal in length.\n|-\n|}\n'''A''': Short arm (p arm)<br />\n'''B''': Centromere<br />\n'''C''': Long arm (q arm)<br />\n'''D''': Sister Chromatids\n]]\n<!-- Subsections of this section are linked in [[Lund's Amphibious Rat]]-->\nEach chromosome has two arms, labeled ''p'' (the shorter of the two) and ''q'' (the longer).

This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} At the same time, Robert \"Bob\" Russell (system programmer and architect on the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]) and [[Robert Yannes|Robert \"Bob\" Yannes]] (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the [[Commodore PET]] line aimed at business users. With the support of Al Charpentier (engineer of the VIC-II) and Charles Winterble (manager of MOS Technology), they proposed to Commodore CEO [[Jack Tramiel]] a true low-cost sequel to the VIC-20. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have {{nowrap|64 KB}} of [[random-access memory]] (RAM). Although 64-[[Kilobit|Kbit]] [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) chips cost over {{US$|100|1985}} at the time, he knew that DRAM prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. The team was able to quickly design the computer because, unlike most other home-computer companies, Commodore had its own [[semiconductor fab]] to produce test chips; because the fab was not running at full capacity, development costs were part of existing corporate overhead. The chips were complete by November, by which time Charpentier, Winterble, and Tramiel had decided to proceed with the new computer; the latter set a final deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES).<ref name=\"ieee85\" />\n\nThe product was [[code name]]d the VIC-40 as the successor to the popular [[VIC-20]].

Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished in time for the show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same [[Commodore BASIC]] 2.0 in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the [[user interface]] [[shell (computing)|shell]] and was available immediately on startup at the <code>READY</code> prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: \"All we saw at our booth were [[Atari]] people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'\"{{r|ieee85}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9449764/Commodore-64-at-30-computing-for-the-masses.html|title=Commodore 64 at 30: Computing for the Masses|author=Christopher Williams|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The answer was [[vertical integration]]; due to Commodore's ownership of [[MOS Technology]]'s [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor fabrication]] facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of {{US$|135}}.{{r|ieee85}}\n\n=== Market war ===\n\n==== 1982\u20131983 ====\n[[File:CBM64Cartridges.JPG|thumb|right|Game cartridges for ''[[Radar Rat Race]]'' and ''[[International Soccer]]'']]\nCommodore had a reputation for [[Vaporware|announcing products that never appeared]], so sought to quickly ship the C64.

In the United States the greatest competitors were the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]] 400, the Atari 800, and the [[Apple II series|Apple&nbsp;II]]. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an [[open architecture]] system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external [[ROM cartridge]] port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the [[Commodore PET|PET]] and [[VIC-20]] days, and the C64 was no exception. Initial C64 sales were nonetheless relatively slow due to a lack of software, reliability issues with early production models, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983, however, a trickle of software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing, especially with price cuts from $600 to just $300.\n\nCommodore sold the C64 not only through its network of authorized dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in [[RF modulator]] and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]]. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a [[composite video]] signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) [[S-Video]], for connection to the [[Commodore 64 peripherals#Other peripherals|Commodore 1702]] monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered to have been a major catalyst in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer.<ref name=\"PM Jun 1983\">{{cite magazine|last=Protecto Enterprise|date=June 1983|title=Commodore computer advertisement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA141|magazine=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|volume=159|issue=6|page=140|issn=0032-4558|quote=We pack with your computer a voucher good for $100 rebate from the factory when you send in your old Atari, Mattel, Coleco electronic game or computer \u2026}}</ref> To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a [[Timex Sinclair 1000]] for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; [[Timex Group USA|Timex Corporation]] departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a [[price war]] with the major [[home computer]] manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of [[Texas Instruments]] and other smaller competitors.\n\nThe price war with Texas Instruments was seen as a personal battle for Commodore president [[Jack Tramiel]].<ref name=\"TM Apr 84\">{{cite magazine |last=Nocera|first=Joseph|date=April 1984|title=Death of a Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA224|magazine=Texas Monthly|location=Austin, Texas|publisher=Emmis Communications|volume=12|issue=4|pages=136\u2013139, 216\u2013226|issn=0148-7736|quote=Once before, Commodore had put out a product in a market where it chief competitor was TI: a line of digital watches.

For example, it could display 256 colors on the screen, while [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] based [[Amiga]]s could only display 64 in [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|HalfBrite]] mode (32 colors and half-bright transformations). Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in the marketplace with Commodore's lower end Amigas and the [[Commodore CDTV]].\n\n=== Clones ===\nClones are computers that imitate C64 functions.  In the middle of 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer [[Tulip Computers]] BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] (C64DTV), a [[joystick]]-based [[handheld TV game|TV game]] based on the C64 with 30 video games built into ROM.  Designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]], a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern [[C-One]] C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]], which had gained modest success earlier in the decade.  The product was advertised on [[QVC]] in the United States for the 2004 holiday season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/technology/a-toy-with-a-story.html|title=A Toy with a Story|author=John Markoff|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 December 2004|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>  By ''\"hacking\"'' the [[circuit board]], it is possible to attach [[Commodore 1541|C1541]] floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks, and [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] keyboards to these units, which gives the DTV devices nearly all the capabilities of a full Commodore 64.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console ''Hummer'', sold at [[RadioShack]] in mid-2005.\n\nIn 2015, a Commodore 64 compatible [[motherboard]] was produced by [[Individual Computers]].  Dubbed the \"C64 Reloaded\", it is a modern redesign of the Commodore 64 motherboard revision 250466 with a few new features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/C64_reloaded|title=C64 reloaded \u2013 IndividualComputers|date=2016-01-14|accessdate=2016-04-15}}</ref>  The motherboard itself is designed to be placed in an empty C64 or C64C case already owned by the user.  Produced in limited quantities, models of this Commodore 64 \"clone\" sport either machined or [[Zero insertion force|ZIF]] sockets in which the custom C64 chips would be placed.  The board also contains [[Jumper (computing)|jumpers]] to accept different revisions of the [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]] and [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] chips, as well as the ability to jumper between the analogue video system modes [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]].  The motherboard contains several innovations, including selection via the RESTORE key of multiple [[KERNAL]] and character ROMs, built-in reset toggle on the power switch, and an [[S-video]] socket to replace the original [[RF modulator|TV modulator]].  The motherboard is powered by a [[DC-to-DC converter]] that uses a single power input of {{nowrap|12 V DC}} from a mains adapter to power the unit rather than the original and failure prone Commodore 64 power supply brick.\n\n=== Newer compatible hardware ===\nAs of 2008, C64 enthusiasts still develop new hardware, including [[Ethernet]] cards,<ref name=\"Dunkels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dunkels.com/adam/tfe/|title=The Final Ethernet \u2013 C64 Ethernet Cartridge|last=Dunkels|first=Adam|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> specially adapted [[hard disk]]s and [[flash memory|flash]] card interfaces ([[sd2iec]]).<ref name=\"sd2iec\">{{cite web|url=http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/SD2IEC |title=SD2IEC |publisher=C64-Wiki |date= |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Brand reuse ===\n[[File:Commodore 64 Web-it PC (modified).jpg|thumb|The C64 \"Web.it\" Internet Computer]]\n\nIn 1998, the C64 brand was reused for the \"Web.it Internet Computer\",<ref name=\"retroport\">{{cite web|url=http://retroport.de/C64_C128_2.html|title=C64, C128 \u2013 Teil 2 \u2013 Retroport|date=June 14, 2013|publisher=Retroport.de|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"amigahist_webit\">{{cite web|title=Commodore 64: Web.It|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/c64web.html|date=June 10, 2007|accessdate=June 16, 2013|publisher=Amigahistory.co.uk}}</ref> a low-powered (even for the time) [[Internet appliance|Internet-oriented]], all-in-one [[x86]] PC running [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]].

The games were unlisted from the service as of August 2013 for unknown reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===THEC64 Mini===\nTHEC64 Mini is a games console realised by [[Retro Games Ltd.]] which takes the form of a non-functional half-scale Commodore 64 keyboard with two [[USB]] and one [[HDMI]] attachments.<ref>https://thec64.com/</ref> The HDMI attachment can be used for connecting the machine to a screen, while the two USB ones are used to connect one or two THEC64 joysticks, which enable the user to use the included software (a game, the BASIC command prompt or the credits).\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main|Commodore 64 software}}\n\nIn 1982, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivaled only by the [[Atari 8-bit family]], and appeared exceptional when compared with the widely publicized [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] and [[Apple&nbsp;II]]. The C64 is often credited with starting the computer [[subculture]] known as the [[demoscene]] (see [[Commodore 64 demos]]). It is still being actively used in the demoscene,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/c4-2008/c4-2008.html |title=C=4 Expo 2008 |publisher=Lyonlabs.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> especially for music (its [[MOS Technology SID|sound chip]] even being used in special sound cards for PCs, and the [[Elektron SidStation]] synthesizer). Even though other computers quickly caught up with it, the C64 remained a strong competitor to the later [[video game console]]s [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Sega Master System]], thanks in part to its by-then established software base, especially outside North America, where it comprehensively outsold the NES.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nBecause of lower incomes and the domination of the [[Sinclair Spectrum]] in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes.  Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983, and in North America the diskette was the principal method of software distribution.  The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years on the market and became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved.  A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16k memory limit.  C64 cartridges normally map into $8000 and depending on the ROM size, may extend up to $BFFF, in which case they displace the BASIC ROM.  A special ID string is checked for on power-up; if found, the Kernal will jump to the starting address specified in the ID string.  A few early C64 cartridges released in 1982 use Ultimax mode (or MAX mode), a leftover feature of the failed MAX Machine.  These cartridges map into $F000 rather than $8000 and displace the Kernal ROM.  If Ultimax mode is used, the programmer will have to provide code for handling system interrupts.  Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($0801) and use a small BASIC stub (e.g., 10 SYS(2064)) to jump to the start of the program.  Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so that execution begins automatically rather than requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt following loading.\n\nUtility software such as a machine language monitor{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} designed to be used from within BASIC loads at $8000{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} or $C000 and can generally be exited from and control returned to BASIC.  Software that loads at $0801 cannot normally be used in conjunction with another BASIC program.  Commodore did not include a reset button on any of their computers until the CBM-II line, but there were third-party cartridges with a reset button on them.  It is possible to trigger a soft reset by jumping to the CPU reset routine at $FCE2 (64738).  A few programs use this as an \"exit\" feature, although it does not clear memory.\n\n=== BASIC ===\n{{Main|Commodore BASIC}}\n[[File:Simons Basic Splash Screen.gif|thumb|right|The Simons' BASIC interpreter start-up screen. Note the altered background and text colors (vs the ordinary C64 blue tones), and the {{nowrap|8 [[kilobyte|KB]]}} reduction of available BASIC-interpreter program memory allocation, due to the [[address space]] used by the cartridge.]]\n\nAs is common for home computers of the early 1980s, the C64 comes with a [[BASIC]] interpreter, in ROM. [[KERNAL|The kernel]], I/O and tape/disk drive operations are accessed via custom BASIC language commands. The disk drive has its own interfacing [[microprocessor]] and ROM (firmware) I/O routines, much like the earlier CBM/PET systems and the [[Atari 400]] and [[Atari 800]]. This means that no memory space is dedicated to running a [[disk operating system]], as was the case with earlier systems such as the [[Apple&nbsp;II]] and [[TRS-80]].\n\nCommodore BASIC 2.0 is used instead of the more advanced BASIC 4.0 from the PET series since C64 users were not expected to need the disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC 4.0. The company did not expect many to buy a disk drive, and using BASIC 2.0 simplified VIC-20 owners' transition to the 64.<ref name=\"heimarck198706\">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-06-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_48_1987_Jun#page/n21/mode/2up|title=When 2 + 3.5 + 4 = 7 / The Evolution of Commodore BASIC|date=June 1987|work=Compute!'s Gazette|pages=20\u201326|accessdate=June 30, 2014|author=Heimarck, Todd}}</ref> \"The choice of BASIC 2.0 instead of 4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical user of a C64 is not expected to need the direct disk commands as much as other extensions and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC were to be limited. We chose to leave expansion space for color and sound extensions instead of the disk features. As a result, you will have to handle the disk in the more cumbersome manner of the 'old days'.\"<ref>\"C64 Basic Introduction\", ''Commodore Magazine'', August 1982, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe version of Microsoft BASIC is not very comprehensive and does not include specific commands for sound or graphics manipulation, instead requiring users to use the \"[[PEEK and POKE]]\" commands to access the graphics and sound chip registers directly. To provide extended commands, including graphics and sound, Commodore produced two different cartridge-based extension to BASIC 2.0: [[Simons' BASIC]] and [[Super Expander 64]]. Other languages available for the C64 include [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[C (programming language)|C]],<ref>{{cite web|author=ShadowM |url=http://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/powerc.html |title=Power C for the Commodore 64 |website=Lyonlabs.org |date=2016-06-07 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clipshop.ca/Aztec/compilers.htm#commodore |title=Wonderfully Ancient Aztec C Compilers |website=Clipshop.ca |date=1986-07-15 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref> [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], and [[FORTRAN]]. Compilers for BASIC 2.0 such as Petspeed&nbsp;2 (from Commodore), Blitz (from Jason Ranheim) and Turbo Lightning (from Ocean Software) were produced. Most commercial C64 software was written in assembly language, either cross developed on a larger computer, or directly on the C64 using a machine code monitor or an assembler. This maximized speed and minimized memory use. Some games, particularly adventures, used high level scripting languages.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Alternative operating systems ===\nMany third party operating systems have been developed for the C64.  As well as the original [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]], two third-party GEOS-compatible systems have been written: [[Wheels (operating system)|Wheels]] and GEOS megapatch.  Both of these require hardware upgrades to the original C64.  Several other operating systems are or have been available, including [[WiNGS OS]], the Unix-like [[LUnix]], operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS [[Contiki]], with full GUI.  Other less well-known OSes include ACE, Asterix, DOS/65, and [[GeckOS]].  A version of [[CP/M]] was released, but this requires the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus.  Furthermore, the Z80 processor is underclocked to be compatible with the C64's memory bus, so performance is poor compared to other CP/M implementations.  C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffer a lack of software; although most commercial CP/M software can run on these systems, software media is incompatible between platforms.  The low usage of CP/M on Commodores means that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore disk format.  The C64 CP/M cartridge is also not compatible with anything except the early 326298 motherboards.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Networking software ===\nDuring the 1980s, the Commodore 64 was used to run [[bulletin board system]]s using software packages such as Bizarre 64, [[Blue Board (software)|Blue Board]], C-Net, [[Color 64]], CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with [[sysop]]-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute [[cracked software]]. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the [[Telnet]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbbsoutpost.servebbs.com |title=Commodore BBS Outpost |website=Cbbsoutpost.servebbs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref> There were major commercial [[online services]], such as [[Compunet]] (UK), [[CompuServe]] (US{{snd}} later bought by [[America Online]]), [[The Source (online service)|The Source]] (US) and [[Minitel]] (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a [[modem]] and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. [[Quantum Link]] (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by [[Quantum Computer Services]] of [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], Virginia, which in October 1991 changed its name to [[America Online]], and continued to operate its [[AOL]] service for the [[IBM PC compatible]] and Apple [[Macintosh]]. Q-Link was a modified version of the [[PlayNET]] system, which [[Control Video Corporation]] (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.\n\n=== Online gaming ===\n{{Main|History of massively multiplayer online games}}\nThe first graphical character-based interactive environment is ''[[Club Caribe]]''. First released as ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'' in 1988, ''Club Caribe'' was introduced by [[LucasArts]] for [[Q-Link]] customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's [[open world]] was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established off-line by [[Ultima (series)|''Ultima'']] and other games) and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as low as 300 [[bits per second]]. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sdtimes.com/sd-times-blog-strangest-software-project-ive-ever-run/|title=The Strangest Software Project I\u2019ve Ever Run|author=Alex Handy|publisher=''[[SD Times]]''|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Hardware ==\n{{Repetition|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== CPU and memory ===\n{{Main|MOS Technology 6510}}\n\nThe C64 uses an [[8-bit]] [[MOS Technology 6510]] [[microprocessor]].  This is a close derivative of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to [[Bank switching|bank-switch]] the machine's [[read-only memory]] (ROM) in and out of the processor's address space, and to operate the [[Commodore Datasette|datasette]] tape recorder.  The C64 has {{nowrap|64\u00bd KB}} of [[random-access memory|RAM]], of which 1024\u00d7\u00bd bytes are color RAM for text mode and {{nowrap|38 KB}} are available to built-in [[Commodore BASIC]] 2.0 on startup.  There is {{nowrap|20 KB}} of ROM, made up of the BASIC interpreter, the Kernal, and the character ROM.  As the processor could only address {{nowrap|64 KB}} at a time, the [[read-only memory|ROM]] was mapped into memory, and only {{nowrap|38,911 bytes}} of RAM (plus 4&nbsp;KB in between the ROMs) were available at startup.  Most \"[[breadbox]]\" Commodore 64s used 4164 DRAM, with eight chips to total up 64K of system RAM.  Late breadbox models and all C64Cs used 41464 DRAM (64K&times;4) chips which stored 32&nbsp;KB per chip, so only two were required.  Since 4164 DRAMs are 64K&times;1, eight chips are needed to make an entire byte, and the computer will not function without all of them present.  Thus, the first chip contains Bit 0 for the entire memory space, the second chip contains Bit 1, and so forth.  This also makes detecting faulty RAM easy, as a bad chip will display random characters on the screen and the character displayed can be used to determine the faulty RAM.\n\nThe C64 performs a RAM test on power up and if a RAM error is detected, the amount of free BASIC memory will be lower than the normal 38911 figure. If the faulty chip is in lower memory, then an ?OUT OF MEMORY IN 0 error is displayed rather than the usual BASIC startup banner. The color RAM at $D800 uses a separate 2114 SRAM chip and is directly gated to the VIC-II. Unlike the rest of system RAM, it cannot be banked out by using the $0/$1 register. If a program does not use the BASIC interpreter, RAM can be read as well as written over that ROM's location. However, this means the character ROM is not available, and the RAM in its place is instead used for the character glyphs. Normally, this RAM is uninitialized, which then results in nothing but random patterns appearing on the screen. This is solved by copying the character ROM into RAM. Most C64 games are written in this way, using tile maps, which require much processor time and memory. The same technique was used earlier in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] (1979) and arcade hardware such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1981).\n\nThe C64 uses a somewhat complicated memory banking scheme; the normal power-on default is to have the BASIC ROM mapped in at $A000 and the screen editor/Kernal ROM at $E000.  Memory underneath the system ROMs can be written to, but not read back without swapping out the ROMs.  $01 contains a register with control bits for enabling/disabling the system ROMS as well as the I/O area at $D000.  Most software swaps out the BASIC ROM; less often, the Kernal is swapped out, as the user must then provide his own code for I/O and interrupt handling.  The $D000 page contains the I/O registers at power on; it can either be swapped with the character ROM (normally invisible to the CPU) or else simply the bare RAM underneath.  If the I/O registers are swapped out, it is also necessary to disable interrupts via a SEI instruction.  Theoretically, if all ROMs and the I/O area are swapped out, the entire 64K of system RAM{{r|prg|p=265}} is accessible to software aside from $00/$01.  If the Kernal ROM is swapped out, BASIC will be removed with it,{{r|prg|p=264}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Mapping the Commodore 64 and 64C|isbn=0-87455-082-3|last=Leemon|first=Sheldon|year=1987|publisher=COMPUTE! Publications|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/Compute_s_Mapping_the_64_and_64C#page/n17/mode/2up}}</ref> and it is not possible to have BASIC active without the Kernal.\n\nThe Kernal ROM went through three separate revisions, mostly designed to fix bugs.  The initial version is only found on 326298 motherboards, used in the first production models, and cannot detect if an NTSC or PAL VIC-II is present.  The second revision is found on all C64s made from late 1982 through 1985.  The third and last Kernal ROM revision was introduced on the 250466 motherboard (late breadbin models with 41464 RAM) and is found in all C64Cs.  The 6510 CPU is clocked at {{nowrap|1.023 MHz}} (NTSC) and {{nowrap|0.985 MHz}} (PAL),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-face-off-zx-spectrum-vs-commodore-64|title=Face-Off: ZX Spectrum vs. Commodore 64|first=Richard|last=Leadbetter|date=29 April 2012|website=eurogamer.net}}</ref> lower than some competing systems (for example, the Atari 800 is clocked at {{nowrap|1.79 MHz}}).  A performance boost can be gained by disabling the VIC-II's video output via a register write; this feature is often used by tape and disk fastloaders as well as the Kernal cassette routines.\n\n=== Joysticks, mice, and paddles ===\nThe C64 retained the [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] [[joystick]] [[Atari joystick port]] from the VIC-20 and added another; any Atari specification game controller can be used on a C64.  The joysticks are read from the registers at $DC00 and $DC01, and most software is designed to use a joystick in port 2 for control rather than port 1, as the upper bits of $DC00 are used by the keyboard and an I/O conflict can result.  Although it is possible to use Sega gamepads on a C64, it is not recommended as the slightly different signal generated by them can damage the CIA chip.  The Start button on Sega Genesis controllers outputs a \u22125V signal; and the other buttons also pull the lines on the CIA low, which is different from the behavior of Atari spec controllers. Register $D419 is used to control paddles and is an analog input. Atari paddles are electrically compatible with the C64, but have different resistance values than Commodore's paddles, which means most software will not work properly with them.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  However, only a handful of games, mostly ones released early in the computer's life cycle, can use paddles. In 1986, Commodore released two mice for the C64 and C128, the 1350 and [[Commodore 1351|1351]]. The 1350 is a digital device, read from the joystick registers (and can be used with any program supporting joystick input); while the 1351 is a true mouse, read with the SID's analog-to-digital converter.\n\n=== Graphics ===\n{{Main|MOS Technology VIC-II}}\n[[File:Fonts-C64.png|thumb|The two PETSCII character sets of the C64]]\nThe [[Video Display Controller|graphics chip]], [[MOS Technology VIC-II|VIC-II]], features 16 colors, eight hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] per [[scanline]] (enabling up to 112 sprites per PAL screen), [[scrolling]] capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes. The standard text mode features 40 columns, like most [[Commodore PET]] models; the built in character encoding is not standard [[ASCII]] but [[PETSCII]], an extended form of ASCII-1963. The kernel ROM sets the VIC-II to a dark blue background on power up with a light blue text and border. Unlike the PET and VIC-20, the C64 uses \"fat\" double-width text as some early VIC-IIs had poor video quality that resulted in a fuzzy picture. Most screenshots show borders around the screen, which is a feature of the VIC-II chip. By utilizing interrupts to reset various hardware registers on precise timings it was possible to place graphics within the borders and thus use the full screen.<ref name=\"Ojala\">{{cite web| url=http://www.antimon.org/dl/c64/code/opening.txt|title=Opening the Borders|last=Ojala|first=Pasi| accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are two low-resolution and two bitmapped modes. The multicolor bitmapped mode has an addressable screen of 160&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;200 pixels, with a maximum of four colors per 4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;8 character block. The high-resolution bitmapped mode has an addressable screen of 320&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;200 pixels, with a maximum of two colors per 8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;8 character block. Multicolor low-resolution has a screen of 160&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;200 pixels, 40&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;25 addressable with four colors per 8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;8 character block; high resolution \"low resolution\" has a screen of 320&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;200 pixels, 40&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;25 addressable with two colors per 8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;8 character block. Most C64 video games use multi-colour mode because of the limited colour available in high resolution.\n\n=== Sound ===\n{{Main|MOS Technology SID}}\n\nThe [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] chip has three channels, each with its own [[ADSR envelope]] generator and filter capabilities. [[Ring modulation]] makes use of channel N\u00b03, to work with the other two channels. [[Robert Yannes|Bob Yannes]] developed the SID chip and later co-founded synthesizer company [[Ensoniq]]. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as \"primitive, obviously...designed by people who knew nothing about music\". Often the game music has become a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are [[Rob Hubbard]], [[Jeroen Tel]], [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]], [[Chris H\u00fclsbeck]], [[Ben Daglish]], [[Martin Galway]], Kjell Nordb\u00f8 and David Dunn among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are often played as [[arpeggio]]s, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering.<ref>{{cite web|title=New revolutionary C64 music routine unveiled|publisher=C64Music!|year=2008|url=http://c64music.blogspot.com.au/2008/11/new-revolutionary-c64-music-routine.html|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are two versions of the SID chip: the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original (\"breadbox\") C64s, the early versions of the 64C, and the [[Commodore 128]]. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. While the 6581 sound quality is a little crisper and many Commodore 64 fans say they prefer its sound, it lacks some versatility available in the 8580 \u2013 for example, the 8580 can mix all available waveforms on each channel, whereas the 6581 can only mix waveforms in a channel in a much more limited fashion. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage. The 6581 uses a {{nowrap|12 volt}} supply\u2014the 8580, a {{nowrap|9 volt}} supply. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a newer 64C board (which uses the {{nowrap|9 volt}} chip). The SID chip's distinctive sound has allowed it to retain a following long after its host computer was discontinued. A number of audio enthusiasts and companies have designed [[MOS Technology SID#Hardware reimplementations|SID-based products]] as add-ons for the C64, [[x86]] PCs, and standalone or [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music devices such as the [[Elektron SidStation]]. These devices use chips taken from excess stock, or removed from used computers. In 2007, [[Timbaland]]'s extensive use of the SidStation led to the [[Timbaland plagiarism controversy|plagiarism controversy]] for \"Block Party\" and \"[[Do It (Nelly Furtado song)|Do It]]\" (written for [[Nelly Furtado]]).\n\n=== Hardware revisions ===\nCommodore made many changes to the C64's hardware during its lifetime, sometimes causing compatibility issues.<ref name=\"halfhill198307\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-07-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_01_1983_Jul#page/n41/mode/2up | title=Commodore 64 Video Update | work=Compute!'s Gazette | date=July 1983 | accessdate=6 February 2016 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | page=40}}</ref> The computer's rapid development, and Commodore and Tramiel's focus on cost cutting instead of product testing, resulted in several defects that caused developers like Epyx to complain and required many revisions to fix; Charpentier said that \"not coming a little close to quality\" was one of the company's mistakes.{{r|ieee85}}\n\nCost reduction was the reason for many revisions. Reducing [[manufacturing cost]]s was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the [[price war]] and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original ([[NMOS logic|NMOS]] based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and [[programmable logic array|PLA]] chips. Initially, a large portion of the cost was eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as [[diode]]s and [[resistor]]s, which enabled the use of a smaller [[printed circuit board]]. There were 16 total C64 motherboard revisions, most of them aimed at simplifying and reducing manufacturing costs. Some board revisions were exclusive to PAL regions. All C64 motherboards were manufactured in [[Hong Kong]].\n\nIC locations changed frequently on each motherboard revision, as did the presence or lack thereof of the metal RF shield around the VIC-II. PAL boards often had aluminized cardboard instead of a metal shield. The SID and VIC-II are socketed on all boards; however, the other ICs may be either socketed or soldered. The first production C64s, made in 1982 to early 1983, are known as \"silver label\" models due to the case sporting a silver-colored \"Commodore\" logo. The power LED had a separate silver badge around it reading \"64\". These machines also have only a 5-pin video cable and cannot output S-video. In late 1982, Commodore introduced the familiar \"rainbow badge\" case, but many machines produced into early 1983 also used silver label cases until the existing stock of them was used up. In the spring of 1983, the original 326298 board was replaced by the 250407 motherboard which sported an 8-pin video connector and added S-video support for the first time. This case design would be used until the C64C appeared in 1987. All ICs switched to using plastic shells while the silver label C64s had some ceramic ICs, notably the VIC-II. The case is made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix \"[[Retr0bright]]\".\n\n[[File:C64motherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An early C64 motherboard (Rev A [[PAL]] 1982).]]\n[[File:C64Cmotherboard.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A C64C motherboard (\"C64E\" Rev B PAL 1992).]]\n\n==== ICs ====\nThe VIC-II was manufactured with 5 [[micrometre|micrometer]] NMOS technology<ref name=\"ieee85\" /> and was clocked at either {{nowrap|17.73447 MHz}} (PAL) or {{nowrap|14.31818 MHz}} (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down to generate the dot clock (about 8&nbsp;MHz) and the [[two-phase clock|two-phase system clocks]] (about 1&nbsp;MHz; the exact pixel and system clock speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic [[dual in-line package]] called a \"CERDIP\". The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.\n\nAfter a redesign in 1983, the VIC-II was encased in a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, but it did not totally eliminate the heat problem.<ref name=\"ieee85\" /> Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a [[heat sink]]. To avoid extra cost, the metal [[radio frequency|RF]] [[electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in [[Europe]] shipped with a cardboard [[Electromagnetic shielding|RF shield]], coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers.<ref name=\"ieee85\" /> The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.\n\n==== Motherboard ====\nIn 1986, Commodore released the last revision to the classic C64 [[motherboard]]. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for the two 64 [[kilobit]] \u00d7 4 bit [[DRAM]] chips that replaced the original eight 64 kilobit \u00d7 1 bit ICs. After the release of the Commodore 64C,<ref name='Commodore 64c abbreviated as \"C64C\" (capital c on both ends)'>{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Mandy|title=Commodore 64C System Guide at Auction on ebay|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Commodore-64C-Personal-Computer-System-Programming-Guide-Manual-RARE-/321552326540?pt=US_Vintage_Computing_Manuals_Merchandise&hash=item4ade031f8c|website=www.ebay.com|publisher=Commodore International|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref> MOS Technology began to reconfigure the original C64's chipset to use [[HMOS]] production technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was renumbered to 85xx to reflect the change to HMOS. In 1987, Commodore released a 64C variant with a highly redesigned motherboard commonly known as a \"short board\". The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring a new 64-pin PLA chip. The new \"SuperPLA\", as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] (TTL) chips. In the last revision of the 64C motherboard, the 2114 color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.\n\n=== Power supply ===\n[[File:Commodore 64 - Joystickports, EinAus-Schalter, Poweranschluss.jpg|thumb|{{nowrap|Joystick ports}}, {{nowrap|power switch}}, {{nowrap|power inlet}}]]\nThe C64 used an external [[power supply]], a [[Linear power supply|conventional transformer]] with multiple tappings (as opposed to [[Switched-mode power supply|switch mode]], the type now used on PC power supplies), encased in an [[epoxy]] resin gel which discouraged tampering but tended to increase the heat level during use. The design saved space within the computer's case and allowed international versions to be more easily manufactured. The [[Commodore 1541|1541-II]] and [[Commodore 1581|1581]] disk drives, along with various third-party clones, also come with their own external power supply \"bricks\", as did most peripherals leading to a \"spaghetti\" of cables and the use of numerous double adapters by users.\n\nCommodore power supplies often [[Mean time between failures|failed before expected]]; the computer reportedly had a 30% return rate in late 1983, compared to the 5-7% the industry considered acceptable.<ref name=\"Infoworld Nov 1983\">{{Cite magazine | last = Mace | first = Scott | title = Commodore 64: Many unhappy returns |magazine= InfoWorld | volume = 5 | issue = 46 | page =23 | publisher = Popular Computing Inc. | date = November 13, 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23 | issn = 0199-6649}}</ref> ''[[Creative Computing]]'' reported four working computers out of seven C64s.<ref name=\"anderson198403\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-03/Creative_Computing_v10_n03_1984_Mar#page/n57/mode/2up | title=Commodore | work=Creative Computing | date=March 1984 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Anderson, John J. | page=56 | authorlink=John J.

To prevent the user from making this fatal mistake, Commodore changed the plug design on 250407 motherboards to a 3-pin connector. Commodore later changed the design, omitting the gel. The follow-on model, the Commodore 128, used a larger, improved power supply that included a fuse. The power supply that came with the [[Commodore REU]] was similar to that of the Commodore 128's unit, providing an upgrade for customers who purchased that accessory.\n\n=== Specifications ===\n\n==== Internal hardware ====\n*Microprocessor CPU:\n**[[MOS Technology 6510]]/8500 (the 6510/8500 is a modified [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] with an integrated 6-bit I/O port)\n**Clock speed: {{nowrap|0.985 MHz ([[PAL]])}} or {{nowrap|1.023 MHz ([[NTSC]])}}\n*Video: [[MOS Technology VIC-II]] 6567/8562 (NTSC), 6569/8565 (PAL)\n**16 colors<ref name=\"the-commodore-zone.com\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.the-commodore-zone.com/articlelive/articles/88/6/Software-Superstars/Page6.html |title=Software Superstars |website=The-commodore-zone.com |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref><!--to be listed-->\n**Text mode: 40\u00d725 characters; 256 user-defined chars (8\u00d78 [[pixel]]s, or 4\u00d78 in multicolor mode); or extended background color; 64 user-defined chars with 4 background colors, 4-bit color RAM defines foreground color\n**Bitmap modes: 320\u00d7200 (2 unique colors in each 8\u00d78 pixel block),<ref name=\"Rautiainen\">{{cite web| url=http://www.devili.iki.fi/Computers/Commodore/C64/Programmers_Reference/Chapter_3/page_123.html |title=Programmers_Reference|last=Rautiainen|first=Sami|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> 160\u00d7200 (3 unique colors + 1 common color in each 4\u00d78 block)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.devili.iki.fi/Computers/Commodore/C64/Programmers_Reference/Chapter_3/page_128.html|title= Programmers_Reference |last=Rautiainen |first=Sami|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref>\n**8 hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] of 24\u00d721 pixels (12\u00d721 in multicolor mode)\n**Smooth scrolling, [[raster interrupt]]s\n*Sound: [[MOS Technology SID|MOS Technology 6581/8580 SID]]\n**3-channel<ref name=\"the-commodore-zone.com\"/> [[synthesizer]] with programmable [[ADSR envelope]]\n**8 [[octave]]s\n**4 [[waveform]]s per audio channel: [[Triangle wave|triangle]], [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth]], [[Square wave|variable pulse]], [[white noise|noise]]\n**[[Oscillator sync]]hronization, [[ring modulation]]\n**Programmable filter: [[high-pass filter|high pass]], [[low-pass filter|low pass]], [[band-pass filter|band pass]], [[Band-stop filter|notch filter]]\n*Input/Output: Two [[MOS Technology CIA|6526 Complex Interface Adapters]]\n**16 bit parallel I/O\n**8 bit serial I/O\n**24-hours (AM/PM) Time of Day clock (TOD), with programmable [[alarm clock]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6502.org/documents/datasheets/mos/mos_6526_cia.pdf|title=MOS 6526 CIA datasheet (PDF format)|author=|date=|website=6502.org}}</ref>\n**16 bit interval timers\n*RAM:\n**64&nbsp;KB, of which 38&nbsp;KB (minus 1&nbsp;byte) were available for BASIC programs\n**1024 [[nybble]]s{{r|prg|p=262}} (512&nbsp;bytes) color RAM (memory allocated for screen color data storage)<ref name=\"Rautiainen_Service_Manual\">{{cite web| url=http://www.devili.iki.fi/Computers/Commodore/C64/Service_Manual/Page_08.html |title=Service_Manual: RAM Control Logic.|last=Rautiainen|first=Sami|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n**Expandable to 320&nbsp;KB with [[Commodore REU|Commodore 1764]] 256&nbsp;KB [[Commodore REU|RAM Expansion Unit]] (REU); although only 64&nbsp;KB directly accessible; REU mostly intended for [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]].

Combining [[science]], [[aesthetics]], and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.\n\nThe fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:\n* Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.\n* Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of [[map projection]]s.\n* Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the map's purpose. This is the concern of [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]].\n* Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.\n* Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience.

The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models \u2013 Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name \"America\". [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts. [[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the [[Werner projection]]. This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]]. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.<ref>Henry Bottomley, \u00ab Between the Sinusoidal projection and the Werner: an alternative to the Bonne \u00bb, ''Cybergeo : European Journal of Geography'' [Online], Cartography, Images, GIS, document 241, Online since 13 June 2003, connection on 27 July 2018.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=01-25-2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=02-26-2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Modern times===\nDue to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the \"Beaver Map\", published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the 18th century, map-makers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase \"After [the original cartographer]\" on the work.<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n==Technological changes==\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-29|title=Hartmann Schedel|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hartmann_Schedel&oldid=817640765|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref> Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]</ref> An example of this understanding is that \"[<nowiki />European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".<ref name=Harley/> 17th century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box' always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps. This social play on cartographic knowledge \"\u2026produces the 'order' of [<nowiki />maps'] features and the 'hierarchies of its practices.'\"<ref>Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes, and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate digital elevation models which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1559/152304006777323118|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=12/31/1986|website=International Cartographic Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref>{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|page=22}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=162\u2013163 |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H. Robinson]], an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed \"will be a cartographic failure.\" He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that \"map design is perhaps the most complex.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Elements of Cartography |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1953 |isbn=0-471-72805-5}}</ref> Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs.\n\nFrom the very beginning of mapmaking, maps \"have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Early Thematic Mapping: In the History of Cartography |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-226-72285-6}}</ref> The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term ''percipient'' refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] |title=How Maps Work |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1995 |isbn=1-57230-040-X}}</ref> The principle of [[Figure-ground in map design|figure-ground]] refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user's experience and keep their attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.\n\nMaking a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. [[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\" (1994, pp.&nbsp;9). An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it (Monmonier, 1993, pp.&nbsp;93).\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=0-528-83492-4}}</ref>\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|pages=60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref>\n\n===Map symbology===\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. Some examples are:\n* A [[#Map key or legend|legend, or key]], explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n====Map key or legend====\n[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe map key, or legend, describes how to interpret the map's symbols and may give details of publication and authorship.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{|  class=\"prettytable\"  \n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps.

Cardiac glycosides, however, inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the E2-P transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. With regard to potassium ion movement, because both cardiac glycosides and potassium compete for binding to the ATPase pump, changes in extracellular potassium concentration can potentially lead to altered drug efficacy.<ref name=Bullock>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODjiBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA615|title=Fundamentals of Pharmacology|last=Bullock|first=Shane|last2=Manias|first2=Elizabeth|date=2013-10-15|publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU|isbn=9781442564411|language=en}}</ref> Nevertheless, by carefully controlling the dosage, such adverse effects can be avoided. Continuing on with the mechanism, raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit the function of a second membrane ion exchanger, [[Sodium-calcium exchanger|NCX]], which is responsible for pumping calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in at a ratio of {{chem|3Na|+}}/{{chem|Ca|2+}}. Thus, calcium ions are also not extruded and will begin to build up inside the cell as well.<ref name=Babula2013rev>{{Cite journal|last=Babula|first=Petr|last2=Masarik|first2=Michal|last3=Adam|first3=Vojtech|last4=Provaznik|first4=Ivo|last5=Kizek|first5=Rene|date=2013-09-01|title=From Na+/K+-ATPase and cardiac glycosides to cytotoxicity and cancer treatment|journal=Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry|volume=13|issue=7|pages=1069\u20131087|pmid=23537048|doi=10.2174/18715206113139990304}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvpharmacology.com/cardiostimulatory/digitalis|title=CV Pharmacology {{!}} Cardiac Glycosides (Digitalis Compounds)|website=cvpharmacology.com|access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe disrupted calcium homeostasis and increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations cause increased calcium uptake into the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR) via the SERCA2 transporter. Raised calcium stores in the SR allow for greater calcium release on stimulation, so the myocyte can achieve faster and more powerful contraction by cross-bridge cycling.<ref name=Pate2016/> The refractory period of the [[Atrioventricular node|AV node]] is increased, so cardiac glycosides also function to decrease heart rate. For example, the ingestion of digoxin leads to increased cardiac output and decreased heart rate without significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure; this quality allows it to be widely used medicinally in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.<ref name=Pate2016/>\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nCardiac glycosides have long served as the main medical treatment to [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]], due to their effects of increasing the force of muscle contraction while reducing heart rate. Heart failure is characterized by an inability to pump enough blood to support the body, possibly due to a decrease in the volume of the blood or its contractile force.<ref name=NHLBI>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hf/treatment|title=How Is Heart Failure Treated? - NHLBI, NIH|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref> Treatments for the condition thus focus on lowering [[blood pressure]], so that the heart does not have to exert as much force to pump the blood, or directly increasing the heart's contractile force, so that the heart can overcome the higher blood pressure. Cardiac glycosides, such as the commonly used digoxin and digitoxin, deal with the latter, due to their positive [[Inotrope|inotropic]] activity.  On the other hand, cardiac arrhythmia are changes in heart rate, whether faster ([[tachycardia]]) or slower ([[bradycardia]]). Medicinal treatments for this condition work primarily to counteract [[tachycardia]] or [[atrial fibrillation]] by slowing down heart rate, as done by cardiac glycosides.<ref name=Bullock/>\n\nNevertheless, due to questions of toxicity and dosage, cardiac glycosides have been replaced with synthetic drugs such as [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[beta blocker]]s and are no longer used as the primary medical treatment for such conditions. Depending on the severity of the condition, though, they may still be used in conjunction with other treatments.<ref name=Bullock/>\n\n== Toxicity ==\nFrom ancient times, humans have used cardiac-glycoside-containing plants and their crude extracts as arrow coatings, homicidal or suicidal aids, rat poisons, heart tonics, diuretics and emetics, primarily due to the toxic nature of these compounds.<ref name=EmedPoison/>  Thus, though cardiac glycosides have been used for their medicinal function, their toxicity must also be recognized. For example, US poison centers reported 2632 cases regarding digoxin toxicity, and 17 cases regarding digoxin-related deaths in 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bronstein|first=Alvin C.|last2=Spyker|first2=Daniel OiA.|last3=Cantilena|first3=Louis R.|last4=Green|first4=Jody L.|last5=Rumack|first5=Barry H.|last6=Giffin|first6=Sandra L.|date=2009-12-01|title=2008 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 26th Annual Report|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=47|issue=10|pages=911\u20131084|doi=10.3109/15563650903438566|issn=1556-9519|pmid=20028214}}</ref> Because cardiac glycosides affect the cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems, these three systems can be used to determine the effects of toxicity. The effect of these compounds on the cardiovascular system presents a reason for concern, as they can directly affect the function of the heart through their inotropic and chronotropic effects. In terms of inotropic activity, excessive cardiac glycoside dosage results in cardiac contractions with greater force, as further calcium is released from the SR of cardiac muscle cells. Toxicity also results in changes to heart chronotropic activity, resulting in multiple kinds of dysrhythmia and potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia. These dysrhythmias are an effect of an influx of sodium and decrease of resting membrane potential threshold in cardiac muscle cells. When taken beyond a narrow dosage range specific to each particular cardiac glycoside, these compounds can rapidly become dangerous. In sum, they interfere with fundamental processes that regulate [[membrane potential]] they are toxic to the heart, the brain, and the gut, at doses that are not difficult to reach.

Prior to the end of the [[slave trade]] and widespread [[Abolitionism|abolition]], when indigenous labour was unavailable, [[Slavery|slaves]] were often imported to the Americas, first by the Portuguese Empire, and later by the Spanish, Dutch, French and British.\n* [[Surrogate Colonialism|Surrogate colonialism]] involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power, in which most of the settlers do not come from same ethnic group as the ruling power.\n* [[Internal colonialism]] is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a [[State (polity)|state]]. The source of exploitation comes from within the state. This is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation passes from whites in the colonizing country to white immigrant population within a newly independent country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race, Ethnicity, Crime, and Justice: An International Dilemma|last=Gabbidon|first=Shaun|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412949880|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=8}}</ref>\n\n==Socio-cultural evolution==\nAs colonialism often played out in pre-populated areas, [[sociocultural evolution]] included the formation of various ethnically hybrid populations. Colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the [[mestizo]]s of the Americas, as well as racially divided populations such as those found in [[French Algeria]] or in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed.\n\nNotable examples in Asia include the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]], [[Anglo-Indian]], [[Burgher people|Burgher]], [[Eurasian Singaporean]], [[Filipino mestizo]], [[Kristang people|Kristang]] and [[Macanese people]]s. In the [[Dutch East Indies]] (later [[Indonesia]]) the vast majority of \"Dutch\" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as [[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]], formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony (see also [[Indos in pre-colonial history]] and [[Indos in colonial history]]).<ref>\nBosma U., Raben R.

The word \"metropole\" comes from the Greek ''metropolis'' [Greek: \"\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2\"]\u2014\"mother city\". The word \"colony\" comes from the Latin ''colonia''\u2014\"a place for agriculture\". Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese established military colonies south of their original territory and absorbed the territory, in a process known as [[nam ti\u1ebfn]].<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]</ref>\n\nModern colonialism started with the [[Age of Discovery]]. Spain (initially the [[Crown of Castile]]) and soon later Portugal encountered the [[Americas]] through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extensions of land. For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of [[expansionism]]. These new lands were divided between the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portuguese Empire]] (then still between Portugal and Castile\u2014the Crown of Castile had a dynastic but not state union with the [[Crown of Aragon]] through the [[Catholic Monarchs]]), first by the papal bull [[Inter caetera]] and then by the treaties of [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] and [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)|Zaragoza]].\n\nThis period is also associated with the [[Commercial Revolution]]. The late Middle Ages saw reforms in accountancy and banking in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean. These ideas were adopted and adapted in western Europe to the high risks and rewards associated with colonial ventures.\n\nThe 17th century saw the creation of the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[Dutch Empire]], as well as the [[English overseas possessions]], which later became the [[British Empire]]. It also saw the establishment of a [[Danish colonial empire]] and some [[Swedish overseas colonies]].\n\nThe spread of colonial empires was reduced in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. However, many new colonies were established after this time, including the [[German colonial empire]] and [[Belgian colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, many European powers were involved in the [[Scramble for Africa]].\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] existed at the same time as the above empires, but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] across the Bering Strait. The [[Empire of Japan]] modelled itself on European colonial empires. The United States of America gained overseas territories after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] for which the term \"[[American imperialism|American Empire]]\" was coined.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910). At its height, it was the [[List of largest empires|largest empire]] in history.]]\n\nAfter the [[World War I|First World War]], the victorious [[Allies of World War I|allies]] divided up the German colonial empire and much of the Ottoman Empire between themselves as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. These territories were divided into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they would be ready for independence.\n\nAfter World War II [[decolonization]] progressed rapidly. This was caused by a number of reasons. First, the Japanese victories in the Pacific War showed Indians, Chinese, and other subject peoples that the colonial powers were not invincible. Second, many colonial powers were significantly weakened by World War II.\n\nDozens of independence movements and global political solidarity projects such as the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] were instrumental in the decolonization efforts of former colonies. These included significant wars of independence fought in Indonesia, Vietnam, Algeria, and Kenya. Eventually, the European powers\u2014pressured by the United States and Soviets\u2014resigned themselves to decolonization.\n\nIn 1962 the [[United Nations]] set up a [[Special Committee on Decolonization]], often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process.\n\n===European empires in the 20th century===\nThe major European empires consisted of the following colonies at the start of [[World War I]] (former colonies of the Spanish Empire became independent before 1914 and are not listed; former colonies of other European empires that previously became independent, such as the former French colony Haiti, are not listed).\n[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|Colonial Governor of the [[Seychelles]] inspecting police guard of honour in 1972]]\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879]]\n\nThe world's colonial population at the time of the First World War totaled about 560 million people, of whom 70.0% were in British domains, 10.0% in French, 8.6% in Dutch, 3.9% in Japanese, 2.2% in German, 2.1% in American, 1.6% in Portuguese, 1.2% in Belgian and 1/2 of 1% in Italian possessions.

Specifically, neocolonialism refers to the theory that former or existing economic relationships, such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]], or through companies (such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[Brunei]]) created by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of their former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post\u2013World War II period.\n\n==Impact of colonialism and colonization==\n{{Main|Western European colonialism and colonization#Colonial actions and their impacts}}\n[[File:Nieuws uit Indonesi\u00eb, het werk van de Nederlandse dienst voor Volksgezondheid Weeknummer 46-21 - Open Beelden - 16742.ogv|thumb|The Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the [[Dutch East Indies]], May 1946]]\n\nThe impacts of colonization are immense and pervasive.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.html Come Back, Colonialism, All is Forgiven]</ref> Various effects, both immediate and protracted, include the spread of virulent [[Pandemic|diseases]], [[oppression|unequal social relations]], [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]], [[enslavement]], [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]], the creation of new institutions, [[Slavery in Africa#Abolition|abolitionism]],<ref name=\"Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012\">Lovejoy, Paul E.

According to [[Strabo]], by the time of emperor [[Augustus]], up to 120 Roman ships would set sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] in [[Roman Egypt]] to India.<ref>\"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Strabo's Geography Book II Chapter 5 ]\"</ref> With the development of trade routes under the [[Ottoman Empire]],\n\n{{blockquote|[[Gujari]] Hindus, Syrian Muslims, Jews, Armenians, Christians from south and central Europe operated trading routes that supplied Persian and Arab horses to the armies of all three empires, Mocha coffee to [[Delhi]] and [[Belgrade]], Persian silk to India and [[Istanbul]].<ref>\n{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-6761-6|page=45}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Aztec civilization]] developed into an extensive empire that, much like the Roman Empire, had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas. For the Aztecs, a significant tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious rituals.<ref>\n{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-6761-6|page=5}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, European colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel, restrict and impede trade involving their colonies, funneling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly.\n\nDespite the general trend of economic expansion, the economic performance of former European colonies varies significantly. In \"Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-run Growth\", economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]] compare the economic influences of the European colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous European colonies, for example, between West African colonies like [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name=\"Institutions\">{{Cite journal|url = http://economics.mit.edu/files/4469|title = Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|last = Acemoglu|first = Daron|date = May 8, 2005|journal = Handbook of Economic Growth, Volume IA|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the paper, economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources. At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions - especially how [[de facto]] and [[de jure]] political power is allocated. To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions.<ref name=\"Institutions\"/>\n\nFor example, one interesting observation is \"the Reversal of Fortune\" - the less developed civilizations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilizations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas. One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area. Therefore, given a more developed civilization and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests. Political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems, which determined the colonial economic performance.<ref name=\"Institutions\"/>\n\nEuropean colonization and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world. In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control. For example, in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights. While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village\u2019s food supply or their individual family\u2019s land. This allowed women to achieve power and autonomy, even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women|last=Freedman|first=Estelle|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=978-0345450531|location=|pages=25\u201326|quote=}}</ref>\n\nThrough the rise of European colonialism came a large push for development and industrialization of most economic systems. However, when working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers. Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men. In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level. The result was a technologic, economic, and class-based gender gap that widened over time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and The Future of Women|last=Freedman|first=Estelle|publisher=Random House Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-0345450531|location=|pages=113|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery and indentured servitude===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade|Indentured servant|Coolie|Blackbirding}}\n[[File:Slave memorial Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|Slave memorial in [[Zanzibar]]. The Sultan of Zanzibar complied with British demands that slavery be banned in Zanzibar and that all the slaves be freed.]]\n\nEuropean nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the European metropole. Exploitation of non-Europeans and other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonizers. Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were slavery and indentured servitude. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants.<ref>\"[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude]\", by Richard Hofstadter, Montgomery College</ref>\n\nEuropean slave traders brought large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail. Spain and Portugal had [[Atlantic slave trade|brought African slaves]] to work at African colonies such as [[Cape Verde]] and the [[Azores]], and then Latin America, by the 16th century. The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries. Ultimately, around 11 million Africans were taken to the Caribbean and North and South America as slaves by European colonizers.<ref name=\"King 2010 24\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|page=24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gor\u00e9e-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright|Slave traders in Gor\u00e9e, [[Senegal]], 18th century]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonizers to develop a new source of labour, using a system of indentured servitude. [[Indentured servant]]s consented to a contract with the European colonizers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well. The employee was \"indentured\" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages. In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts created by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony.\n\nIndia and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more indentured servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|pages=26\u20137}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa and the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition.<ref name=\"Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012\"/>\n\n===Military innovation===\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[First Anglo-Ashanti War]], 1823-31]]\nImperial expansion follows military conquest in most instances. Imperial armies therefore have a long history of military innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer. Greeks developed the [[phalanx]] system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield. Under [[Philip II of Macedon]], they were able to organize thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Peoples and Empires|year=2003|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-6761-6|page=6}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great]] exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.\n\nThe Spanish Empire held a major advantage over [[Mesoamerican]] warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the [[Aztec civilization]] and others. The European development of firearms using [[gunpowder]] cemented their military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.\n\n===The end of empire===\n[[File:Lord Pethic-Lawrence and Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] with [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Lord Pethwick-Lawrence]], British Secretary of State for India, after a meeting on 18 April 1946]]\nThe populations of some colonial territories, such as Canada, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power, at least among the majority; however, minority populations such as [[First Nations]] peoples and French-Canadians experienced [[marginalization]] and resented colonial practises. Francophone residents of [[Quebec]], for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the [[Conscription crisis of 1917]]. Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population. Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's [[Sepoy Rebellion]].\n\nThe territorial boundaries imposed by European colonizers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another. European colonizers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control. Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators. Once independence from European control was achieved, civil war erupted in some former colonies, as native populations fought to capture territory for their own ethnic, cultural or political group.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The [[Partition of India]], a 1947 civil war that came in the aftermath of India's independence from Britain, became a conflict with 500,000 killed. Fighting erupted between Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities as they fought for territorial dominance. Muslims fought for an independent country to be partitioned where they would not be a religious minority, resulting in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Matthew |author-link=Matthew White (historian) |title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things |year=2012 |publisher=W.

In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace. 900,000 French colonists (known as the ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'') resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962. A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent. 800,000 people of [[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso#The retornados|Portuguese]] origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between 1974 and 1979; 300,000 settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the [[Dutch West Indies]] after Dutch military control of the colony ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An Atlas of Migration|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-26124-2|page=35}}</ref>\n\nAfter WWII 300,000 Dutchmen from the [[Dutch East Indies]], of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called [[Indo people|Indo Europeans]], repatriated to the Netherlands.

Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation. For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous,<ref>{{cite web|title=British Nationality Act 1981|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61|publisher=The National Archives, United Kingdom|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies.\n\nIn some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is an organization that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members. A similar organization exists for former colonies of France, the [[Francophonie]]; the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the [[Dutch Language Union]] is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands.\n\nMigration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies. Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the [[Maghreb]] countries of north Africa and the majority population of France. Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of \"inner Paris\" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seljuq|first=Affan|title=Cultural Conflicts: North African Immigrants in France|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|date=July 1997|volume= 2|issue= 2|issn=1085-7494|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol2_2/seljuq.htm|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Introduced diseases===\n{{See also|Globalization and disease|Columbian Exchange|Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonization}}\n[[File:Florentinoviruela.JPG|thumb|Aztecs dying of smallpox, (\"[[Florentine Codex|The Florentine Codex]]\" 1540\u201385)]]\n\nEncounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.<ref>Kenneth F.

From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol. The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies.\n\nThe empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by [[Alexander the Great]], spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies. While most Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others (the word [[barbarian]] is derived from mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like \"bar-bar\"), Alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] of the Persians. He [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html adopted Persian customs of clothing] and otherwise encouraged his men to [[wiktionary:go native|go native]] by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms. Of note is that he radically departed from earlier Greek attempts at colonization, characterized by the [[History of the Peloponnesian War|murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants]] and the settling of Greek citizens from the polis.\n\nRoman universalism was characterized by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law. [[Roman law]] was imposed on both Roman citizens and colonial subjects. Although Imperial Rome had [[Education in ancient Rome|no public education]], [[Latin]] spread through its use in government and trade. Roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves, which was responsible for the 200 year long [[Pax Romana]], at the time the longest period of peace in history. The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, even allowing them on a few occasions to [[Hyrcanus II|threaten Roman authority]].\n\n===Colonialism and geography===\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-99-01.jpg|thumb|[[British Togoland]] in 1953]]\n\nSettlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony, thus bridging the geographical, ideological and commercial gap between the colonizers and colonized.

Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps. During colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art. The rhetoric favored the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate. Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the center of the map. As Harley would put it \"The steps in making a map \u2013 selection, omission, simplification, classification, the creation of hierarchies, and 'symbolization' \u2013 are all inherently rhetorical.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=J.

Assumptions are that colonialism and imperialism are interchangeable, however [[Robert J. C. Young]] suggests that imperialism is the concept while colonialism is the practice. Colonialism is based on an imperial outlook, thereby creating a consequential relationship. Through an empire, colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded, on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire. In the next section Marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship.\n\n===Marxist view of colonialism===\nMarxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism, enforcing exploitation and social change. Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development. It is an \"instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency\".<ref name=Dic>''Dictionary of Human Geography'', \"Colonialism\"</ref> Colonies are constructed into modes of production. The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for [[capital accumulation]]. Lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism, as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as [[Lyal S. Sunga]] explains: \"Vladimir Lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self-determination of peoples in his \"Theses on the Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination\" as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism\" and he quotes Lenin who contended that \"The right of nations to self-determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense, the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation. Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation.\"<ref>''In the Emerging System of International Criminal Law: Developments and Codification'', Brill Publishers (1997) at page 90, Sunga traces the origin of the international movement against colonialism, and relates it to the rise of the right to self-determination in international law.</ref> Non Russian marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, meanwhile, between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.\n\nIn his critique of colonialism in Africa, the Guyanese historian and political activist [[Walter Rodney]] states:\n\n:\"The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available&nbsp;... When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of [[underdevelopment]]&nbsp;... During the centuries of pre-colonial trade, some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism. Colonialism went much further than trade. It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa. Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society. Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards&nbsp;... Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called 'mother country'. From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources. It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped.\n\n:\"Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector. As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Rodney|title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwSSkemSJLcC&pg=PA224|publisher=East African Publishers|pages=149, 224|isbn=9789966251138}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Henry Schwarz|author2=Sangeeta Ray|title=A Companion To Postcolonial Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyiZafDHpqoC&pg=PA271|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=271|isbn=9780470998335}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the new imperialism emphasized the transition of capitalism from [[free trade]] to a stage of [[monopoly]] [[capitalism]] to finance [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. He states it is, \"connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world\". As [[free trade]] thrives on [[exports]] of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry. This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism. He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing. War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism. As a continuation of this thought G. N. Uzoigwe states, \"But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses.\"<ref>Boahen, A. Adu.

In this sense, postcolonial literature may be considered a branch of [[postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said|Edward Sa\u00efd]]'s book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] made similar claims decades before Sa\u00efd).\n\nSa\u00efd analyzed the works of [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautr\u00e9amont]] arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to [[Subaltern Studies]].\n\nIn ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak argued that major works of European [[metaphysics]] (such as those of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers [[Western culture|Western civilization]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also had some traces of [[Racism|racialism]] in his work.\n\n==British public opinion about the British Empire==\nThe 2014 [[YouGov]] survey found that British people are mostly proud of colonialism and the [[British Empire]]:<ref>{{cite news |title=Colonial nostalgia is back in fashion, blinding us to the horrors of empire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/colonial-nostalgia-horrors-of-empire-britain-olympic |work=The Guardian |date=24 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A new YouGov survey finds that most think the British Empire is more something to be proud of (59%) rather than ashamed of (19%). 23% don't know.

According to the 2014 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.35 million in the [[urban area]] and over 6.8 million in the [[Casablanca-Settat]] region. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national [[Capital (political)|political capital]] is [[Rabat]].\n\nThe leading Moroccan companies and international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca retains its historical position as the main industrial zone of the country. The [[Port of Casablanca]] is one of the largest artificial ports in the world,<ref name=\"EotO\">{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/casablan.htm |title=''Casablanca'' \u2013 ''Encyclopedia of the Orient'' |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> and the second largest port of [[North Africa]], after [[Tanger-Med]] {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Tangier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/mc_casablanca.htm |title=''Discovering Casablanca'' |publisher=Africa-ata.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> Casablanca also hosts the primary [[naval base]] for the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe original name of Casablanca was ''Anfa'', in [[Berber language]], by at least the seventh century BC.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to ''Casa Branca'' ({{IPA-pt|kaz\u0250'b\u027e\u0250\u0303k\u0250|}}). It derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word combination meaning \"White House\" (''{{lang|pt|branca}}'' \"white\", ''{{lang|pt|casa}}'' \"house\"). The present name, which is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version ({{IPA-es|kasa\u02c8\u03b2la\u014bka|pron}}), came when the [[Portuguese kingdom]] was integrated in [[personal union]] to the Spanish kingdom. During the [[French protectorate in Morocco]], the name remained Casablanca ({{IPA-fr|kazabl\u0251\u0303ka|pron}}). In 1755 an earthquake destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by the Sultan who changed the name into the local [[Arabic]] which is ''Ad-dar Al Baidaa''', although Arabic also has its own version of Casablanca (\u0643\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627, ''K\u0101z\u0101bl\u0101nk\u0101''). The city is still nicknamed ''Casa'' by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called ''Ad-dar Al-Bida'', instead.\n\nA famous boulevard inside Casablanca City is called \"Anfa Boulevard\". Anfa is generally considered the early \"old original city\" of Casablanca; it is legally a prefecture (district) with half a million city inhabitants.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Casablanca|Timeline of Casablanca}}\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by [[Berber people|Berbers]] by at least the seventh century BC.<ref name=JVL>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Casablanca.html |title='&#39;Casablanca'&#39; |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.<ref name=lexic>{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://www.lexicorient.com/e.o/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca \u2013 LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> In his book [[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Description of Africa]], [[Leo Africanus]] refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of [[Barghawata]] in 744&nbsp;AD.

In response, the French attacked by ship, bombarding the city from the coast, and landing troops inside the town, which caused severe damage to the town and 15,000 dead and wounded bodies. The French claimed that it was to restore order there. This effectively began the process of colonization, although French control of Casablanca was not formalised until 1910.

Around 25% of them are under 15 and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total [[Demographics of Morocco|population of Morocco]]. [[Grand Casablanca]] is also the largest [[urban area]] in the [[Maghreb]]. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|website=Pewforum.org|date=2012|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf}}</ref>\nDuring the [[French protectorate in Morocco]], [[European Moroccans|European]] [[Christians]] formed almost half the population.<ref name=\"A history of the Arab peoples\"/> Since independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially.\n\n=== Judaism in Casablanca ===\nA [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city, by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah [[Synagogue]] was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].<ref name=JVL/> Today, the [[Jewish cemetery of Casablanca]] is one of the major cemeteries of the city.\nThe [[Moroccan Jewish Museum]] is a museum established in the city in 1997. It is the only museum devoted to Judaism in the Arab world (see also [[History of the Jews in Morocco]]).\n\n== Main sites ==\nThe French period Ville Nouvelle (New Town) of Casablanca was designed by the French architect [[Henri Prost]], and was a model of a [[planned community|new town]] at that time. The main streets radiate south and east from Place des Nations Unies, previously the main market of Anfa. Former administrative buildings and modern hotels populate the area. Their style is a combination of [[Hispanic-Moorish style|Hispano-Moorish]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nCasablanca is home to the [[Hassan II Mosque]], designed by the French architect [[Michel Pinseau]]. It is situated on a [[promontory]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The mosque has room for 25,000 worshippers inside, and a further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque's courtyard. Its [[minaret]] is the world's tallest at {{convert|210|m|abbr=off}}. The mosque is also the largest in North Africa, and the third-largest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque |title=Hassan II Mosque in Morocco, Morocco |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101232/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\nWork on the mosque started in 1980, and was intended to be completed for the 60th birthday of the former [[King of Morocco|Moroccan king]], [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], in 1989. However, the building was not inaugurated until 1993. Authorities spent an estimated $800&nbsp;million in the construction of the building.\n\nThe Parc de la Ligue Arabe (formally called Lyautey) is the city's largest [[public park]]. On its edge is the [[Casablanca Cathedral]] (Cath\u00e9drale Sacr\u00e9-Coeur). It is no longer in use for religious purposes, but it is open to visitors and a splendid example of [[Moorish Revival|Mauresque]] architecture. [[The Old Medina]] (the part of town antedating the French protectorate) attracts fewer tourists than the [[Medina quarter|medinas]] of cities such as [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Marrakech]]. However, it has undergone some restoration in recent years. Included in this project have been the western walls of the medina, its ''skala'', or [[bastion]], and its colonial-period clock tower.\n\nA popular site among locals is the small island Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane. It is possible to walk across to the rocky island at low tide. This outcrop contains the tomb of [[Sidi Abder Rahman El Thaelebi|Sidi Abderrhamane Thaalibi]], a [[Sufi]] from [[Baghdad]] and the founder of Algiers. He is considered a saint in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morocco.com/blog/visiting-the-venerated-site-of-marabout-de-sidi-abderrahmane |title=Visiting the Venerated Site of Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane&nbsp;\u2013 English Blog &#124; By Morocco Channel |publisher=Morocco.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> Because of this, many Moroccans make informal pilgrimages to this site \"to reflect on life and to seek religious enlightenment\". Some believe that the saint possessed magical powers, so his tomb still possesses these powers. People come and seek this magic to be cured. Non-Muslims may not enter the shrine.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nPublic: [[University of Hassan II Casablanca]]\n\nPrivate:\n* [[Universit\u00e9 Mundiapolis]]\n* [[Universit\u00e9 Internationale de Casablanca]]\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nInternational schools:\n* Belgium: [[\u00c9cole Belge de Casablanca]]\n* French:\n** [[Coll\u00e8ge Anatole France (Casablanca)|Coll\u00e8ge Anatole France]]\n** [[Lyc\u00e9e Lyautey (Casablanca)|Lyc\u00e9e Lyautey]]\n** [[Groupe Scolaire Louis Massignon]]\n** [[Lyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence (Casablanca)|Lyc\u00e9e La R\u00e9sidence]]\n** [[Lyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide (Casablanca)|Lyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide]] ([[:fr:Lyc\u00e9e Ma\u00efmonide|FR]])\n** [[Lyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain (Casablanca)|Lyc\u00e9e L\u00e9on l'Africain]]\n** [[\u00c9cole Normale H\u00e9bra\u00efque]]\n** [[\u00c9cole Al Jabr]]\n* Italian: [[Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\" (Morocco)|Scuola \"Enrico Mattei\"]]\n* Spanish: [[Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]]\n* American:\n** [[Casablanca American School]]\n** [[American Academy Casablanca]]\n** [[George Washington Academy]]\n\n== Sports ==\n\n=== Hosting ===\nCasablanca staged the [[1961 Pan Arab Games]], the [[1983 Mediterranean Games]], and games during the [[1988 Africa Cup of Nations]].

Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in Equatorial Guinea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea to host 2015 Cup|date=14 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30059022}}</ref> Casablanca will host the [[2019 African Games]] after [[Malabo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] withdraw its hosting rights due to economic problems.\n\n=== Venues ===\n\n* Stade Larbi Zaouli\n* [[Stade Mohamed V]]\n* Stade Sidi Bernoussi\n* Complexe Al Amal de Casablanca\n\nThe [[Grand Stade de Casablanca]] is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of [[Raja Casablanca]], [[Wydad Casablanca]], and the [[Morocco national football team]]. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 80,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the [[Stade Mohamed V]]. The initial idea of the stadium was for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2014, ready for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].\n\n=== Association football ===\nCasablanca is home to two popular football clubs, [[Wydad Casablanca]]<ref name=\"African concord\">{{cite book|title=African Concord|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUsuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=1989|publisher=Concord Press of Nigeria|page=43}}</ref> and [[Raja Casablanca]].<ref name=\"West Africa\">{{cite book|title=West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V310AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2003|publisher=West Africa Publishing Company, Limited|page=38}}</ref> Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a goose. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: [[Salaheddine Bassir]], [[Abdelmajid Dolmy]], [[Baddou Zaki]], [[Aziz Bouderbala]], and [[Noureddine Naybet]]. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include [[Rachad Bernoussi]], [[TAS de Casablanca]], [[Majd Al Madina]], and [[RAC Casablanca|Racing Casablanca]].\n\n=== Tennis ===\nCasablanca hosts The [[Grand Prix Hassan II]], a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour. It first began in 1986, and is played on clay courts type at [[Complexe Al Amal]].\n\nNotable winners of the Hassan II Grand-Prix are [[Thomas Muster]] in 1990, [[Hicham Arazi]] in 1997, [[Younes El Aynaoui]] in 2002, and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] in 2010.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Casablanca Tramway.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca tramway]]]]\n\n=== Tram ===\nThe [[Casablanca tramway]] is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca.

Regular domestic flights serve [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], [[Agadir]], [[Oujda]], [[Tangier]], Al Hoceima, and [[Laayoune]], as well as other cities.\n\nCasablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Paris]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[London]] and [[Dubai]] are important primary destinations.\n\nThe older, smaller [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]] to the west of the city, served certain destinations including [[Damascus]], and [[Tunis]], and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the \"[[Casablanca Finance City]]\", the new heart of the city of Casablanca. [[Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport]] is located in the nearby community of [[Tit Mellil]].\n\n=== Coaches ===\nCTM coaches (intercity buses) and various private lines run services to most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the Gare Routi\u00e8re on Rue L\u00e9on l'Africain in downtown Casablanca.\n\n=== Metro ===\n''See also: [[Al Bidaoui|Casablanca RER]] or [[Casablanca metro]]''\n\nSince the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a [[Casablanca metro|metro system]] to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maghrebemergent.com/actualite/maghrebine/item/38911-le-metro-fantome-de-casablanca-disparait-de-nouveau-au-profit-du-tramway.html |title=Le m\u00e9tro \u2018\u2019fant\u00f4me\u2019\u2019 de Casablanca dispara\u00eet de nouveau\u2026au profit du Tramway |trans-title=The ''ghost'' metro of Casablanca disappears again... for the benefit of the tramway |first=Merouane |last=Korso |publisher=Maghreb Emergent |language=French |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=24 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125051333/http://maghrebemergent.com/actualite/maghrebine/item/38911-le-metro-fantome-de-casablanca-disparait-de-nouveau-au-profit-du-tramway.html |archive-date=2015-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afrik.com/maroc-le-metro-de-casablanca-tombe-a-l-eau |title=Maroc : le m\u00e9tro de Casablanca tombe \u00e0 l\u2019eau... |trans-title=Morocco: The Casablanca Metro falls overboard... |first=Assanatou |last=Bald\u00e9 |publisher=Afrik.com |language=French |date=4 July 2014 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating [[Casablanca Tramway|tram system]] instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2014/07/03/97002-20140703FILWWW00030-1-tram-mais-pas-de-metro-aerien-a-casablanca.php |title=Le tram, mais pas de m\u00e9tro a\u00e9rien \u00e0 Casablanca |trans-title=Tram yes, but no elevated metro in Casablanca |date=3 July 2014 |publisher=Le Figaro |accessdate=23 November 2015 |language=French}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n{{See also|Taxicabs of Morocco}}\nRegistered [[Taxicab|taxis]] in Casablanca are coloured red and known as ''petit taxis'' (small taxis), or coloured white and known as ''grands taxis'' (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, ''petits taxis,'' typically small-four door [[Dacia Logan]], [[Peugeot 207]], or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. ''Grands taxis,'' generally older [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, provide shared [[mini-bus]] like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. ''Grands taxis'' may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.\n\n=== Trains ===\nCasablanca is served by three principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]].\n\n{{stnlnk|Casa-Voyageurs}} is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to [[Marrakech]] or [[El Jadida]] and north to [[Mohammedia]] and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]]/[[Nador]]. A dedicated airport shuttle service to [[Mohammed V International Airport]] also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.\n[[File:CasablancaTrainStation.jpg|thumb|left|Casa-Port railway station]]\n\n{{stnlnk|Casa-Port}} serves primarily commuter trains such as the [[Train Navette Rapide]] (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca \u2013 [[Kenitra]] rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark [[Casablanca Twin Center]]. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the [[Casablanca Tramway|city's new tram network]].\n\n[[Oasis railway station|Casa-Oasis]] was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Merieme Chadid.jpg|thumb|[[Merieme Chadid]] led an international scientific program to install a major astronomical observatory in Antarctica.]]\n{{See also|Category:People from Casablanca}}\n\n*[[Amal Ayouch]] (born 1966) - stage and film actress\n* [[Salaheddine Bassir]] \u2013 Moroccan footballer\n* [[Larbi Benbarek]] \u2013 Moroccan footballer\n* [[Frida Boccara]] \u2013 French singer, Winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969]]\n* [[Soufiane Choubani]] \u2013 Founder of the Moroccan National Debate Team\n* [[French Montana]] \u2013 American rapper\n* [[La Fouine]] \u2013 Moroccan-French rapper\n* [[El Haqed]] \u2013 Moroccan rapper\n* [[Dizzy DROS]] \u2013 Moroccan rapper\n* [[Jean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes]] \u2013 French footballer\n* [[Jean-Charles de Castelbajac]] \u2013 French fashion designer\n* [[Merieme Chadid]] \u2013 Moroccan astronomer\n* [[Serge Haroche]] \u2013 French physicist who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics\n* [[Shatha Hassoun]] \u2013 Moroccan/Iraqi singer\n* [[Lydia Hatuel-Czuckermann]] \u2013 Israeli Olympic fencer\n* [[Hicham Mesbahi]] \u2013 Moroccan boxer\n* [[Nawal El Moutawakel]] \u2013 Olympic champion\n* [[Noureddine Naybet]] \u2013 Moroccan footballer\n* [[Mostafa Nissaboury]] \u2013 Moroccan poet\n* [[Hakim Noury]] \u2013 Moroccan film director\n* [[Maurice Ohana]] \u2013 French composer\n* [[Jean Reno]] \u2013 French Hollywood actor\n* [[Daniel Sivan]] \u2013 professor\n* [[Alain Souchon]] \u2013 French songwriter\n* [[Frank Stephenson]] \u2013 award-winning automobile designer\n* [[Hassan Saada]] \u2013 Moroccan boxer arrested for alleged rape before Olympic match<ref name=\"straitstimes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/morocco-boxer-held-over-alleged-sex-attack-in-olympic-village|publisher=straitstimes.com|title=Morocco boxer held over alleged sex attack in Olympic Village, World News & Top Stories - The Straits Times|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Sidney Taurel]] \u2013 naturalized American CEO of Eli Lilly and Company from 1998 to 2008\n* [[Richard Virenque]] \u2013 French cyclist\n* [[Abdallah Zrika]] \u2013 Moroccan poet\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Casablanca, title.JPG|thumb|''Casablanca'', an American romantic drama film directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]]]\n* Casablanca is the setting of the 1942 [[Casablanca (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. The film has achieved worldwide popularity since then. Nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], it won three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n* ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946) was the 12th [[Marx Brothers]]' movie. The film stars [[Groucho Marx]], [[Chico Marx]], and [[Harpo Marx]]. It was directed by [[Archie Mayo]] and written by [[Joseph Fields]] and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song \"[[Who's Sorry Now?]]\", with music by [[Ted Snyder]] and lyrics by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. It is sung in French by [[Lisette Verea]] playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English.

The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. \nA cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter [[X]], is also termed a [[saltire]] in heraldic terminology.\n\n== Name ==\nThe word ''[[:wikt:cross|cross]]'' is recorded in 10th-century [[Old English]] as ''cros'', exclusively for the instrument of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]], replacing the native Old English word ''[[rood]]''. The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from [[Old Irish]], possibly via [[Old Norse]], ultimately from the Latin ''[[:wikt:crux|crux]]'' (or its accusative ''crucem'' and its genitive ''crucis''), \"stake, cross\". The English verb ''to cross'' arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense \"to make the sign of the cross\"; the generic meaning \"to intersect\" develops in the 15th century.\nThe Latin word was, however, influenced by [[popular etymology]] by a native Germanic word reconstructed as ''*krukjo'' (English ''[[:wikt:crook|crook]]'', Old English ''crycce'', Old Norse ''krokr'', Old High German ''krucka''). This word, by conflation with Latin ''crux'', gave rise to Old French ''crocier'' (modern French ''crosse''), the term for a [[shepherd's crook]], adopted in English as [[crosier]].\n\nLatin ''crux'' referred to the [[gibbet]] where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D117%3Aentry%3Dcrux Lewish and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'': crux]</ref> From this word was derived the Latin verb ''crucio'' \"to put to death on the cross\" or (more frequently) \"to put to the rack, to torture, torment\" especially in reference to mental troubles.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D116%3Aentry%3Dcrucio Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]: crucio]</ref> The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of ''crux''.<ref>[http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/crux002.pdf Gunnar Samuelsson, ''Crucifixion in Antiquity'' (Mohr Siebeck 2011), p. 203]</ref> A ''crux'' can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (''[[crux simplex]]'') to the various composite kinds of cross (''crux compacta'') made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional \u2020-shaped cross (the ''crux immissa''), but also the T-shaped cross (the ''crux commissa'' or [[Tau Cross]]), which the [[Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross]] indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the ''crux decussata'' or [[saltire]]).\n\nThe Greek equivalent of Latin ''crux'' \"stake, gibbet\" is [[stauros|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 ''stauros'']], found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in [[Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross]], which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter [[tau]] ([[\u03a4]]).<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.vi.ii.ix.html The Epistle of Barnabas, IX]</ref><ref>[http://logoslibrary.org/clement/stromata/611.html Clement of Alexandria, ''The Stromata'', book VI, chapter 11]</ref><ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.marcionem3.shtml Adversus Marcionem, liber III, cap.

De Mortillet is of opinion that such use of the sign was not merely ornamental, but rather a symbol of consecration, especially in the case of objects pertaining to burial. In the proto-Etruscan cemetery of Golasecca every tomb has a vase with a cross engraved on it. True crosses of more or less artistic design have been found in Tiryns, at Mycen\u00e6, in Crete, and on a fibula from Vulci.\" O.

The [[sign of the cross]] associated with Christian [[genuflection]] is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.\n\nCrossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the \"cross my heart\" movement associated with making a promise and the [[Tau]] shape of the [[referee]]'s \"time out\" hand signal.\n\nIn Chinese-speaking cultures, crossed index fingers represent the number 10.\n\n==Other things known as \"cross\" ==\n{{main|Cross (disambiguation)}}\n*[[Crux]], or the Southern Cross, is a cross-shaped [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

The atom within a ligand that is bonded to the central metal atom or ion is called the '''donor atom'''.  In a typical complex, a metal ion is bonded to several donor atoms, which can be the same or different. A [[Ligand#Polydentate and polyhapto ligand motifs and nomenclature|polydentate]] (multiple bonded) ligand is a molecule or ion that bonds to the central atom through several of the ligand's atoms; ligands with 2, 3, 4 or even 6 bonds to the central atom are common. These complexes are called [[chelate complex]]es; the formation of such complexes is called chelation, complexation, and coordination.\n\nThe central atom or ion, together with all ligands, comprise the [[coordination sphere]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chemistry-dictionary.com/definition/coordination+sphere.php |title= Definition of coordination sphere |publisher= chemistry-dictionary.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/cchem/whatis.html |title= What Is A Coordination Compound? |publisher= Purdue University Department of Chemistry }}</ref>  The central atoms or ion and the donor atoms comprise the first coordination sphere.\n\n'''Coordination''' refers to the \"coordinate covalent bonds\" ([[dipolar bond]]s) between the ligands and the central atom. Originally, a complex implied a reversible association of [[molecule]]s, [[atom]]s, or [[ion]]s through such weak [[chemical bond]]s. As applied to coordination chemistry, this meaning has evolved. Some metal complexes are formed virtually irreversibly and many are bound together by bonds that are quite strong.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-0-471-19957-1 |page=1355|last=Cotton|first=Frank Albert|author2=Geoffrey Wilkinson |author3=Carlos A.

The most common coordination numbers are 2, 4, and especially 6. A hydrated ion is one kind of a complex ion (or simply a complex), a species formed between a central metal ion and one or more surrounding ligands, molecules or ions that contain at least one lone pair of electrons,\n\nIf all the ligands are [[Denticity|monodentate]], then the number of donor atoms equals the number of ligands. For example, the cobalt(II) hexahydrate ion or the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion [Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> is a hydrated-complex ion that consists of six water molecules attached to a metal ion Co. The oxidation state and the coordination number reflect the number of bonds formed between the metal ion and the ligands in the complex ion. However, the coordination number of Pt([[Ethylenediamine|en]]){{su|b=2|p=2+}} is 4 (rather than 2) since it has two bidentate ligands, which contain four donor atoms in total.\n\nAny donor atom will give a pair of electrons. There are some donor atoms or groups which can offer more than one pair of electrons. Such are called bidentate (offers two pairs of electrons) or polydentate (offers more than two pairs of electrons). In some cases an atom or a group offers a pair of electrons to two similar or different central metal atoms or acceptors\u2014by division of the electron pair\u2014into a [[three-center two-electron bond]]. These are called bridging ligands.\n\n==History==\nCoordination complexes have been known since the beginning of modern chemistry. Early well-known coordination complexes include dyes such as [[Prussian blue]]. Their properties were first well understood in the late 1800s, following the 1869 work of [[Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand]]. Blomstrand developed what has come to be known as the complex ion chain theory. The theory claimed that the reason coordination complexes form is because in solution, ions would be bound via ammonia chains. He compared this effect  to the way that various carbohydrate chains form.\n[[File:Alfred Werner ETH-Bib Portr 09965.jpg|thumb|189x189px|[[Alfred Werner]]]]\nFollowing this theory, Danish scientist [[Sophus Mads J\u00f8rgensen]] made improvements to it. In his version of the theory, J\u00f8rgensen claimed that when a molecule dissociates in a solution there were two possible outcomes: the ions would bind via the ammonia chains Blomstrand had described or the ions would bind directly to the metal.\n\nIt was not until 1893 that the most widely accepted version of the theory today was published by [[Alfred Werner]]. Werner\u2019s work included two important changes to the Blomstrand theory. The first was that Werner described the two different ion possibilities in terms of location in the coordination sphere. He claimed that if the ions were to form a chain this would occur outside of the coordination sphere while the ions that bound directly to the metal would do so within the coordination sphere.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136410/coordination-compound|title = Coordination Compound|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> In one of Werner\u2019s most important discoveries however he disproved the majority of the chain theory. Werner was able to discover the spatial arrangements of the ligands that were involved in the formation of the complex hexacoordinate cobalt. His theory allows one to understand the difference between a coordinated ligand and a charge balancing ion in a compound, for example the chloride ion in the cobaltammine chlorides and to explain many of the previously inexplicable isomers.[[File:Hexol-2D-wedged.png|thumb|Structure of hexol|left|162x162px]]In 1914, Werner first resolved the coordination complex, called [[hexol]], into optical isomers, overthrowing the theory that only carbon compounds could possess chirality.\n\n==Structures==\nThe ions or molecules surrounding the central atom are called [[ligand]]s. Ligands are generally bound to the central atom by a [[coordinate covalent bond]] (donating electrons from a [[lone pair|lone electron pair]] into an empty metal orbital), and are said to be '''coordinated''' to the atom. There are also organic ligands such as [[alkene]]s whose [[pi bond]]s can coordinate to empty metal orbitals. An example is [[ethene]] in the complex known as [[Zeise's salt]], K<sup>+</sup>[PtCl<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>\u2212</sup>.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn coordination chemistry, a structure is first described by its [[coordination number]], the number of ligands attached to the metal (more specifically, the number of donor atoms). Usually one can count the ligands attached, but sometimes even the counting can become ambiguous. Coordination numbers are normally between two and nine, but large numbers of ligands are not uncommon for the lanthanides and actinides. The number of bonds depends on the size, charge, and [[electron configuration]] of the metal ion and the ligands. Metal ions may have more than one coordination number.\n\nTypically the chemistry of transition metal complexes is dominated by interactions between s and p [[molecular orbital]]s of the donor-atoms in the ligands and the d orbitals of the metal ions.  The s, p, and d orbitals of the metal can accommodate 18 electrons (see [[18-Electron rule]]). The maximum coordination number for a certain metal is thus related to the electronic configuration of the metal ion (to be more specific, the number of empty orbitals) and to the ratio of the size of the ligands and the metal ion. Large metals and small ligands lead to high coordination numbers, e.g. [Mo(CN)<sub>8</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>. Small metals with large ligands lead to low coordination numbers, e.g. Pt[P(CMe<sub>3</sub>)]<sub>2</sub>. Due to their large size, [[lanthanide]]s, [[actinide]]s, and early transition metals tend to have high coordination numbers.\n\nDifferent ligand structural arrangements result from the coordination number. Most structures follow the points-on-a-sphere pattern (or, as if the central atom were in the middle of a [[polyhedron]] where the corners of that shape are the locations of the ligands), where orbital overlap (between ligand and metal orbitals) and ligand-ligand repulsions tend to lead to certain regular geometries. The most observed geometries are listed below, but there are many cases that deviate from a regular geometry, e.g. due to the use of ligands of different types (which results in irregular bond lengths; the coordination atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern), due to the size of ligands, or due to [[electronic effect]]s (see, e.g., [[Jahn\u2013Teller distortion]]):\n\n*[[Linear molecular geometry|Linear]] for two-coordination\n*[[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|Trigonal planar]] for three-coordination\n*[[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|Tetrahedral]] or [[square planar molecular geometry|square planar]] for four-coordination\n*[[Trigonal bipyramid molecular geometry|Trigonal bipyramidal]] for five-coordination\n*[[Octahedral molecular geometry|Octahedral]] ([[orthogonal]]) for six-coordination\n*[[Pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|Pentagonal bipyramidal]] for seven-coordination\n*[[Square antiprismatic molecular geometry|Square antiprismatic]] for eight-coordination\n*[[Tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry|Tricapped trigonal prismatic]] for nine-coordination\n\nThe idealized descriptions of 5-, 7-, 8-, and 9- coordination are often indistinct geometrically from alternative structures with slightly different L-M-L (ligand-metal-ligand) angles, e.g. the difference between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal structures.<ref>Wells A.F.

When three identical ligands occupy one face of an octahedron, the isomer is said to be facial, or '''fac'''. In a ''fac'' isomer, any two  identical ligands are adjacent or ''cis'' to each other. If these three ligands and the metal ion are in one plane, the isomer is said to be meridional, or '''mer'''. A ''mer'' isomer can be considered as a combination of a ''trans'' and a ''cis'', since it contains both trans and cis pairs of identical ligands.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<gallery widths=\"170\">\nImage:Cis-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|''cis''-[CoCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>\nImage:Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|''trans''-[CoCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>\nImage:Fac-trichlorotriamminecobalt(III).png|''fac''-[CoCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]\nImage:Mer-trichlorotriamminecobalt(III).png|''mer''-[CoCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\n=====Optical isomerism=====\n[[Optical isomerism]] occurs when a molecule is not superimposable with its mirror image.

The electronic structure can be described by a relatively ionic model that ascribes formal charges to the metals and ligands. This approach is the essence of [[crystal field theory]] (CFT).  Crystal field theory, introduced by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1929, gives a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanically]] based attempt at understanding complexes.  But crystal field theory treats all interactions in a complex as ionic and assumes that the ligands can be approximated by negative point charges.\n\nMore sophisticated models embrace covalency, and this approach is described by [[ligand field theory]] (LFT) and [[Molecular orbital theory]] (MO). Ligand field theory, introduced in 1935 and built from molecular orbital theory, can handle a broader range of complexes and can explain complexes in which the interactions are [[covalent]]. The chemical applications of [[group theory]] can aid in the understanding of crystal or ligand field theory, by allowing simple, symmetry based solutions to the formal equations.\n\nChemists tend to employ the simplest model required to predict the properties of interest; for this reason, CFT has been a favorite for the discussions when possible. MO and LF theories are more complicated, but provide a more realistic perspective.\n\nThe electronic configuration of the complexes gives them some important properties:\n\n===Color of transition metal complexes===\n[[File:Copper complex.jpg|frame|right|Synthesis of copper(II)-tetraphenylporphyrin, a metal complex, from [[tetraphenylporphyrin]] and [[copper(II) acetate monohydrate]].]]\nTransition metal complexes often have spectacular colors caused by electronic transitions by the absorption of light. For this reason they are often applied as [[Pigment#Physical basis|pigments]]. Most transitions that are related to colored metal complexes are either d\u2013d transitions or [[charge transfer band]]s.  In a d\u2013d transition, an electron in a d&nbsp;orbital on the metal is excited by a photon to another d orbital of higher energy, therefore d\u2013d transitions occur only for partially-filled d-orbital complexes (d<sup>1\u20139</sup>). For complexes having d<sup>0</sup> or d<sup>10</sup> configuration, charge transfer is still possible even though d\u2013d transitions are not. A charge transfer band entails promotion of an electron from a metal-based orbital into an empty ligand-based orbital ([[Charge transfer complex|metal-to-ligand charge transfer]] or MLCT).  The converse also occurs: excitation of an electron in a ligand-based orbital into an empty metal-based orbital ([[Charge transfer complex|ligand-to-metal charge transfer]] or LMCT). These phenomena can be observed with the aid of electronic spectroscopy; also known as [[UV-Vis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= Harris, |first1= D. |last2= Bertolucci |first2= M. |title= Symmetry and Spectroscopy |year= 1989 |publisher= Dover Publications }}</ref> For simple compounds with high symmetry, the d\u2013d transitions can be assigned using [[Tanabe\u2013Sugano diagram]]s.

However, for the common Ln<sup>3+</sup> ions (Ln = lanthanide) the colors are all pale, and hardly influenced by the nature of the ligand. The colors are due to 4f electron transitions. As the 4f orbitals in lanthanides are \u201cburied\u201d in the xenon core and shielded from the ligand by the 5s and 5p orbitals they are therefore not influenced by the ligands to any great extent leading to a much smaller [[crystal field theory|crystal field]] splitting than in the transition metals. The absorption spectra of an Ln<sup>3+</sup> ion approximates to that of the free ion where the electronic states are described by [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin-orbit coupling]]. This contrasts to the transition metals where the ground state is split by the crystal field. Absorptions for Ln<sup>3+</sup> are weak as electric dipole transitions are parity forbidden ([[Laporte Rule]] forbidden) but can gain intensity due to the effect of a low-symmetry ligand field or mixing with higher electronic states (''e.g.'' d orbitals). Also absorption bands are extremely sharp which contrasts with those observed for transition metals which generally have broad bands.<ref name = \"C&W6th\">{{Cotton&Wilkinson6th}}</ref><ref name=CottonSA2006>{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=Simon |year=2006 |title=Lanthanide and Actinide Chemistry|publisher= John Wiley & Sons Ltd}}</ref> This can lead to extremely unusual effects, such as significant color changes under different forms of lighting.\n\n===Magnetism===\n{{main|magnetochemistry}}\nMetal complexes that have unpaired electrons are [[magnetic]]. Considering only monometallic complexes, unpaired electrons arise because the complex has an odd number of electrons or because electron pairing is destabilized.  Thus, monomeric Ti(III) species have one \"d-electron\" and must be [[paramagnetism|(para)magnetic]], regardless of the geometry or the nature of the ligands.  Ti(II), with two d-electrons, forms some complexes that have two unpaired electrons and others with none. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX<sub>2</sub>[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>: when X&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[Chlorine|Cl]], the complex is paramagnetic ([[high spin|high-spin]] configuration), whereas when X&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[methyl group|CH<sub>3</sub>]], it is diamagnetic ([[low spin|low-spin]] configuration). It is important to realize that ligands provide an important means of adjusting the [[ground state]] properties.\n\nIn bi- and polymetallic complexes, in which the individual centres have an odd number of electrons or that are high-spin, the situation is more complicated.  If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centres, the electrons may couple ([[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic coupling]], resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other ([[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic coupling]]).  When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules.\n\n===Reactivity===\nComplexes show a variety of possible reactivities:<ref>R. G. Wilkins Kinetics and Mechanism of Reactions of Transition Metal Complexes, 2nd Edition, VCH, Weinheim, 1991. {{ISBN|1-56081-125-0}}</ref>\n\n*Electron transfers\n*:A common reaction between coordination complexes involving ligands are [[Inner sphere electron transfer|inner]] and [[outer sphere electron transfer]]s. They are two different mechanisms of [[electron transfer]] [[redox]] reactions, largely defined by the late [[Henry Taube]]. In an inner sphere reaction, a ligand with two [[lone electron pair]]s acts as a ''[[bridging ligand]]'', a ligand to which both coordination centres can bond. Through this, electrons are transferred from one centre to another.\n*(Degenerate) [[ligand exchange]]\n*:One important indicator of reactivity is the rate of degenerate exchange of ligands.  For example, the rate of interchange of coordinate water in [M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>''n''+</sup> complexes varies over 20 orders of magnitude.  Complexes where the ligands are released and rebound rapidly are classified as labile.  Such labile complexes can be quite stable thermodynamically.  Typical labile metal complexes either have low-charge (Na<sup>+</sup>), electrons in d-orbitals that are [[antibonding]] with respect to the ligands (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), or lack covalency (Ln<sup>3+</sup>, where Ln is any lanthanide).  The lability of a metal complex also depends on the high-spin vs. low-spin configurations when such is possible.  Thus, high-spin Fe(II) and Co(III) form labile complexes, whereas low-spin analogues are inert.  Cr(III) can exist only in the low-spin state (quartet), which is inert because of its high formal oxidation state, absence of electrons in orbitals that are M\u2013L antibonding, plus some \"ligand field stabilization\" associated with the d<sup>3</sup> configuration.\n* Associative processes\n*:Complexes that have unfilled or half-filled orbitals often show the capability to react with substrates.  Most substrates have a singlet ground-state; that is, they have lone electron pairs (e.g., water, amines, ethers), so these substrates need an empty orbital to be able to react with a metal centre.  Some substrates (e.g., molecular oxygen) [[triplet oxygen|have a triplet ground state]], which results that metals with half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates (it must be said that the [[dioxygen]] molecule also has lone pairs, so it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).\n\nIf the ligands around the metal are carefully chosen, the metal can aid in ([[stoichiometric]] or [[catalytic]]) transformations of molecules or be used as a sensor.\n\n==Classification==\nMetal complexes, also known as coordination compounds, include all metal compounds, aside from metal vapors, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, and [[alloy]]s.  The study of \"coordination chemistry\" is the study of \"inorganic chemistry\" of all [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, [[transition metal]]s, [[lanthanide]]s, [[actinides]], and [[metalloid]]s. Thus, coordination chemistry is the chemistry of the majority of the periodic table.  Metals and metal ions exist, in the condensed phases at least, only surrounded by ligands.\n\nThe areas of coordination chemistry can be classified according to the nature of the ligands, in broad terms:\n*Classical (or \"[[Alfred Werner|Werner]] Complexes\"): Ligands in classical coordination chemistry bind to metals, almost exclusively, via their [[lone pair]]s of electrons residing on the main-group atoms of the ligand. Typical ligands are H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, [[chloride|Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]], [[Cyanide|CN<sup>\u2212</sup>]], [[ethylenediamine|en]].  Some of the simplest members of such complexes are described in [[metal aquo complex]]es, [[metal ammine complex]]es,\n:Examples: [Co([[EDTA]])]<sup>\u2212</sup>, [[Cobalt(III) hexammine chloride|[Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>]], [[Potassium ferrioxalate|[Fe(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]K<sub>3</sub>]]\n*Organometallic Chemistry:  Ligands are organic (alkenes, alkynes, alkyls) as well as \"organic-like\" ligands such as phosphines, hydride, and CO.\n:Example: [[Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer|(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)Fe(CO)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]]\n*Bioinorganic Chemistry: Ligands are those provided by nature, especially including the side chains of amino acids, and many [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s such as [[porphyrin]]s.\n:Example: [[hemoglobin]] contains [[heme]], a porphyrin complex of iron\n:Example: [[chlorophyll]] contains a porphyrin complex of magnesium\n:Many natural ligands are \"classical\"  especially including water.\n*Cluster Chemistry: Ligands are all of the above  also include other metals as ligands.\n: Example Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>\n\n*In some cases there are combinations of different fields:\n:Example: [[Iron-sulfur protein|[Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>(Scysteinyl)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>]], in which a cluster is embedded in a biologically active species.\n\n[[Mineralogy]], [[materials science]], and [[solid state chemistry]]&nbsp;\u2013 as they apply to metal ions&nbsp;\u2013 are subsets of coordination chemistry in the sense that the metals are surrounded by ligands.  In many cases these ligands are oxides or sulfides, but the metals are coordinated nonetheless, and the principles and guidelines discussed below apply. In [[water of crystallization|hydrate]]s, at least some of the ligands are water molecules. It is true that the focus of mineralogy, materials science, and solid state chemistry differs from the usual focus of coordination or inorganic chemistry. The former are concerned primarily with polymeric structures, properties arising from a collective effects of many highly interconnected metals. In contrast, coordination chemistry focuses on reactivity and properties of complexes containing individual metal atoms or small ensembles of metal atoms.\n\n==Naming complexes==\nThe basic procedure for naming a complex:\n# When naming a complex ion, the ligands are named before the metal ion.\n# Write the names of the ligands in alphabetical order. (Numerical prefixes do not affect the order.)\n#* Multiple occurring monodentate ligands receive a prefix according to the number of occurrences: ''di-'', ''tri-'', ''tetra-'', ''penta-'', or ''hexa''.  Polydentate ligands (e.g., ethylenediamine, oxalate) receive ''bis-'', ''tris-'', ''tetrakis-'', etc.\n#* Anions end in ''o''.  This replaces the final 'e' when the anion ends with '-ide', '-ate' or '-ite', e.g. ''chloride'' becomes ''chlorido'' and ''sulfate'' becomes ''sulfato''. Formerly, '-ide' was changed to '-o' (e.g. ''chloro'' and ''cyano''), but this rule has been modified in the 2005 IUPAC recommendations and the correct forms for these ligands are now ''chlorido'' and ''cyanido''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/databases/Red_Book_2005.pdf |title= Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry IUPAC Recommendations 2005 |at= section 1.6.4 (p. 10-11) |publisher= [[IUPAC]] }}</ref>\n#* Neutral ligands are given their usual name, with some exceptions: NH<sub>3</sub> becomes ''[[ammine]]''; H<sub>2</sub>O becomes ''aqua'' or ''aquo''; CO becomes ''carbonyl''; NO becomes ''nitrosyl''.\n# Write the name of the central atom/ion.  If the complex is an anion, the central atom's name will end in ''-ate'', and its Latin name will be used if available (except for mercury).\n\n# If the central atom's oxidation state needs to be specified (when it is one of several possible, or zero), write it as a Roman numeral (or 0) in parentheses.\n# Name cation then anion as separate words (if applicable, as in last example)\n\nExamples:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!metal\n!changed to\n|-\n|cobalt\n|cobaltate\n|-\n|aluminium\n|aluminate\n|-\n|chromium\n|chromate\n|-\n|vanadium\n|vanadate\n|-\n|copper\n|cuprate\n|-\n|iron\n|ferrate\n|}\n: [Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>] <sup>2+</sup>  \u2192 hexaaquacopper(II) ion\n: [NiCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup> \u2192 tetrachloridonickelate(II) ion (The use of chloro- was removed from IUPAC naming convention)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/databases/Red_Book_2005.pdf |title= Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry IUPAC Recommendations 2005 |at= section 1.6.4 (p. 10-11) |publisher= [[IUPAC]] }}</ref>\n: [CuCl<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup> \u2192 amminepentachloridocuprate(II) ion\n: [Cd(CN)<sub>2</sub>(en)<sub>2</sub>] \u2192 dicyanidobis(ethylenediamine)cadmium(II)\n: [CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate\n: K<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] \u2192 potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II)\n\nThe coordination number of ligands attached to more than one metal (bridging ligands) is indicated by a subscript to the Greek symbol [[mu (letter)|\u03bc]] placed before the ligand name. Thus the [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] of [[aluminium trichloride]] is described by Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>(\u03bc<sub>2</sub>-Cl)<sub>2</sub>.\n\nAny anionic group can be electronically stabilized by any cation. An anionic complex can be stabilised by a hydrogen cation, becoming an acidic complex which can dissociate to release the cationic hydrogen. This kind of complex compound has a name with \"ic\" added after the central metal. For example, H<sub>2</sub>[Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>] has the name tetracyanoplatinic (II) acid.\n\n== Stability constant ==\n{{Main|Stability constants of complexes}}\n\nThe affinity of metal ions for ligands is described by a stability constant, also called the formation constant, and is represented by the symbol K<sub>f</sub>. It is the [[equilibrium constant]] for its assembly from the constituent metal and ligands, and can be calculated accordingly, as in the following example for a simple case:\n\n:(X)Metal<sub>(aq)</sub> + (Y)Lewis Base<sub>(aq) </sub> {{eqm}} (Z)Complex Ion<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\n:<math>K_f = \\frac{[\\text{Complex ion}]^Z}{[\\text{Metal ion}]^X[\\text{Lewis base}]^Y}</math>\n\nwhere X, Y, and Z are the [[stoichiometric]] coefficients of each species. Formation constants vary widely.  Large values indicate that the metal has high affinity for the ligand, provided the system is at equilibrium.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www2.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/CHEM2/solubil8.htm|title = Complex Ion Equilibria|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nSometimes the stability constant will be in a different form known as the constant of destability. This constant is expressed as the inverse of the constant of formation and is denoted as K<sub>d</sub> = 1/K<sub>f</sub> .<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www2.bakersfieldcollege.edu/wcooper/Chem%20B1B%20Notes%20Fall_09/Chap_17_Solubility_Equilibrium_Notes.pdf|title = Solubility and Complex-ion Equilibria|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Stretton|first = Tom}}</ref> This constant represents the reverse reaction for the decomposition of a complex ion into its individual metal and ligand components. When comparing the values for K<sub>d</sub>, the larger the value is the more unstable the complex ion is.\n\nAs a result of these complex ions forming in solutions they also can play a key role in solubility of other compounds. When a complex ion is formed it can alter the concentrations of its components in the solution. For example:\n\n:Ag{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + 2NH<sub>4</sub>OH<sub>(aq)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>){{su|b=2|p=+}} + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag{{su|b=(aq)|p=+}} + Cl{{su|b=(aq)|p=\u2212}}\n\nIf these reactions both occurred in the same reaction vessel, the solubility of the silver chloride would be increased by the presence of NH<sub>4</sub>OH because formation of the silver(I)\u2013ammine complex consumes a significant portion of the free silver ions from the solution. By [[Le Chatelier's principle]], this causes the equilibrium reaction for the dissolving of the silver chloride, which has silver ion as a product, to shift to the right.\n\nThis new solubility can be calculated given the values of K<sub>f</sub> and K<sub>sp</sub> for the original reactions. The solubility is found essentially by combining the two separate equilibria into one combined equilibrium reaction and this combined reaction is the one that determines the new solubility. So K<sub>c</sub>, the new solubility constant, is denoted by:\n:<math>K_c = K_{sp} * K_f</math>\n\n<!--==Specific metal complexes==\n\n===Mercury===\n\nThe speciation, solubility, mobility, and toxicity of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] within aquatic environments are strongly influenced by its [[Chemical Reaction|complexation]] with inorganic and organic [[ligands]]; most notable is mercury\u2019s interaction with [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM).  As a result, the speciation of mercury depends on the concentration of each ligand and the stability constants of mercury complexes they form.  For mercury, important inorganic ligands include hydroxide, chloride, and sulfide.  However, complexation by natural organic compounds often controls the [[aqueous geochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycling of mercury. For example, complexation with DOM may limit the availability of Hg<sup>2+</sup> for conversion to methylmercury or enhance the formation of elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>) from Hg<sup>2+</sup>, further reducing the availability of Hg<sup>2+</sup> for conversion to methylmercury.<ref name=\"Lamborg et al\">Lamborg, C.

Therefore, mercury is expected to preferentially bind with thiol and other sulfur-containing functional groups which, despite their relatively low abundance in DOM, far exceed the amount of mercury available in aquatic environments.<ref name=\"Ravichandran et al\" /> Previous research has shown that binding of Hg<sup>2+</sup> by organic ligands does not occur immediately when both are present; instead, complexation tends to follow a pseudo-first-order rate constant with exponential decay.<ref name=\"Lamborg et al\" /> \n \nPredicting mercury speciation due to Hg-DOM complexes is difficult due to organic matter heterogeneity, electrostatic effects, and the variation in stability constants; however, recent studies have shown conditional stability constants for mercury binding to be in the range of 10<sup>22</sup> \u2013 10<sup>28</sup>.<ref name=\"Ravichandran et al\" /> \n    \nCompetitive ligand exchange (CLE) experiments, in which Hg binding to natural organic ligands is measured in the presence of an added ligand whose complexation with Hg<sup>2+</sup> is well characterized, is used to determine the concentrations and apparent stability constants of natural mercury complexes.

Gill, 2005, Determination of Mercury Complexation in Coastal and Estuarine Waters Using Competitive Ligand Exchange Method: Environmental Science and Technology, 39, 6607-6615.</ref>  This study showed that lower concentrations of binding sites with higher stability constants are more important for Hg speciation than higher concentrations of weaker binding sites.\n\nConditional stability constants vary with pH due to competition with protons for binding sites.<ref name=\"Han et al\" />  They also vary with salinity and, contrary to what may be expected, are generally lower in freshwater than seawater.<ref name=\"Lamborg et al\" /> In seawater, organic complexes must have very high K values in order to compete with chloride for mercury complexation.  In freshwater systems, hydroxide is the most common inorganic ligand, yet its concentration is low enough that organic ligands do not need to have a high K value to compete for mercury complexation.  In both environments, organic compounds dominate mercury complexation.<ref name=\"Lamborg et al\" /><ref name=\"Han et al\" />\n\nIn examining the role of DOM in mercury speciation under sulfidic environments, we see that inorganic sulfide also plays an important role within anoxic environments due to the very strong binding of sulfide with mercury.  HgS{{su|p=0|b=(aq)}}, Hg(S<sub>2</sub>H)<sup>\u2212</sup>, Hg(SH){{su|b=2|p=0}}, and [[mercury sulfide|HgS<sub>(s)</sub>]] are likely to be the most important species.  Recent studies however, have shown that stability constants of Hg-DOM complexation are higher than those for mercury sulfide complexation.  These results then imply that organic matter can out complete sulfide for the complexation of mercury within anoxic environments.<ref name=\"Ravichandran et al\" />\n\nDOM has been shown to affect the bioaccumulation of mercury via photochemical reduction and methylation.  Reduction of Hg<sup>2+</sup> to Hg<sup>0</sup> by sunlight is a commonly occurring process, yet is enhanced in the presence of DOM.  Conversely, photolysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can produce radical oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2212</sup>OH), which in turn have been shown to oxidize Hg<sup>0</sup> to Hg<sup>2+</sup>.<ref name=\"Ravichandran et al\" />   Conversion of ionic mercury (especially Hg<sup>2+</sup>) to methyl mercury is an important process, as methyl mercury is a neurotoxin and has been show to bioaccumulate within the food chain.  Mercury methylation is a microbially mediated process wherein bacteria assimilate neutrally charged mercury species through passive diffusion.  Complexation with DOC limits this uptake mechanism as the DOC molecules are too large to pass through cell membranes; however, at low pH, DOC is less negatively charged and therefore less likely to complex mercury, thereby making mercury more available for methylation.  Additionally, DOM-mediated reduction of Hg<sup>2+</sup> to Hg<sup>0</sup> would further limit the availability of mercury for methylation by leading to the mercury volatilization.    Direct methylation of mercury can also occur by reaction with humic and fulvic acids in DOM.<ref name=\"Ravichandran et al\" />-->\n\n==Application of coordination compounds==\nMetals only exist in solution as coordination complexes, it follows then that this class of compounds is useful in a wide variety of ways.\n\n===Bioinorganic chemistry===\nIn [[bioinorganic chemistry]] and [[bioorganometallic chemistry]], coordination complexes which serve either structural or catalytic functions. An estimated 30% of proteins contain metal ions.  Examples include the intensely colored [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], the [[Heme|heme group]] in [[hemoglobin]], the [[cytochrome]]s, and the [[Chlorin|chlorin group]] in [[chlorophyll]].  [[Carboxypeptidase]], a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion. Another complex ion enzyme is [[catalase]], which decomposes the cell's waste [[hydrogen peroxide]].\n\n===Industry===\n[[Homogeneous catalysis]] is a major application of coordination compounds for the production of organic substances.  Processes include [[hydrogenation]], [[hydroformylation]], [[oxidation]].  In one example, a combination of titanium trichloride and triethylaluminium gives rise to [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s, used for the [[polymerization]] of ethylene and propylene to give polymers of great commercial importance as fibers, films, and plastics.\n\nNickel, cobalt, and copper can be extracted using [[hydrometallurgy|hydrometallurgical processes]] involving complex ions. They are extracted from their ores as [[Metal ammine complex|ammine]] complexes. Metals can also be separated using the selective precipitation and solubility of complex ions. Cyanide is used chiefly for extraction of gold from its ores.\n\n[[Phthalocyanine]] complexes are an important class of pigments.\n\n===Analysis===\nAt one time, coordination compounds were used to identify the presence of metals in a sample. [[Qualitative inorganic analysis]] has largely been superseded by instrumental methods of analysis such as [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS), [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] (ICP-AES) and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS).\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Coordination compounds}}\n*[[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry]]\n*[[Coordination geometry]]\n*[[Coordination isomerism]]\n*[[Inclusion compound]]s\n*[[Organometallic chemistry]] deals with a special class of coordination compounds where organic fragments are bonded to a metal at least through one C&nbsp;atom.\n*[[Metallaprism]]\n*[[Coordination polymers]], in which coordination complexes are the repeating units.\n* [[Activated complex]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* De Vito, D.; Weber, J. ; Merbach, A.

Initially the business supplied leather and \"shoe findings\" to shoe repairers.<ref name=\"Coleco 1932-1982\">{{cite book|title=Coleco 1932-1982|date=1982|publisher=Coleco Industries, Inc.}}</ref>  Shoe findings are the supplies and paraphernalia of a shoe repair shop.  The company later (1938) branched out into selling rubber footwear.  With the advent of [[World War II]] the demand for the basic supplies that the company produced dramatically increased.  By the end of the war the company was much bigger and on a stable financial ground and had branched out into new and used shoe machinery, hat cleaning equipment and even marble shoeshine stands.\n\nBy the early 1950s, and thanks to [[Maurice Greenberg (Coleco founder)|Maurice Greenberg]]'s son, [[Leonard Goldberg (Coleco)|Leonard Greenberg]], the company had diversified further and was making leather lacing and [[leathercraft]] kits.  In 1954, at the New York Toy Fair, the leather moccasin kit was selected as a Child Guidance Prestige Toy, and Connecticut Leather Company decided to go wholeheartedly into the toy business.  In 1956, Leonard read of an emerging technology, the vacuum forming of plastic, which led the company to become very successful, producing an enormous array of different plastic toys and wading pools.\n\nIn 1961 the leather and shoe findings portion of the business was sold<ref>{{cite news|title= Coleco moves out of the cabbage patch|work= The New York Times|date=1985-07-21|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/21/business/coleco-moves-out-of-the-cabbage-patch.html?&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=N. R. | last=Kleinfield}}</ref>, and Connecticut Leather Company became Coleco Industries, Inc. On January 9, 1962 Coleco went public, offering stock at $5.00 a share.\n\nIn 1963 the company acquired the Kestral Corporation of Springfield, Massachusetts, a manufacturer of inflatable vinyl pools and toys. This led to Coleco becoming the largest manufacturer of above ground swimming pools in the world.\n\nBy 1966, the company had grown massively so Leonard persuaded his brother [[Arnold Greenberg (Coleco)|Arnold Greenberg]] to join the company.  Further acquisitions added to the company's growth, namely Playtime Products (1966) and Eagle Toys of Canada (1968).  By the end of the 1960s, Coleco ran ten manufacturing facilities and had a new corporate headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe 1970s were a difficult decade for Coleco and yet despite this sales crossed the $100 million mark. When Coleco became listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1971 sales had grown to $48.6 million. In 1972 Coleco entered the snowmobile market through acquisition, however poor snowfall and market conditions led to disappointing sales and profits.\n\nUnder CEO [[Arnold Greenberg (Coleco)|Arnold Greenberg]], the company entered the [[video game console]] business with the [[Coleco Telstar|Telstar]] in 1976. Dozens of companies were introducing game systems that year after [[Atari]]'s successful [[Pong]] console. Nearly all of these new games were based on [[General Instrument]]'s \"Pong-on-a-chip\". However, General Instrument had underestimated demand, and there were severe shortages. Coleco had been one of the first to place an order, and was one of the few companies to receive an order in full. Though dedicated game consoles did not last long on the market, their early order enabled Coleco to [[break-even|break even]].\n\nColeco continued to do well in electronics. The company transitioned next into [[handheld electronic game]]s, a market popularized by [[Mattel]]. An early hit was [[Electronic Quarterback]]. Coleco produced two very popular lines of games, the \"head to head\" series of two player sports games, (Football, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Hockey) and the Mini-Arcade series of licensed [[Arcade game|video arcade]] titles such as ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. A third line of educational handhelds was also produced and included the Electronic Learning Machine, Lil Genius, Digits, and a trivia game called Quiz Wiz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco |title=Coleco Handheld Games |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> Launched in 1982, their first four [[handheld electronic game|tabletop]] Mini-Arcades, for ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'', ''Donkey Kong'', and ''[[Frogger]]'', sold approximately three million units within a year.<ref name=\"eg_16_10\">{{cite journal|title=More Mini-Arcades A Comin'|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=June 1983|volume=4|issue=16 |url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1983-06/Electronic_Games_Issue_16_Vol_02_04_1983_Jun#page/n9/mode/2up|accessdate=1 February 2012|page=10}}</ref> Among these, 1.5 million units were sold for ''Pac-Man'' alone.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mini-Arcades 'Go Gold'|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=November 1982|volume=1 |issue=9|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-11/Electronic_Games_Issue_09_Vol_01_09_1982_Nov#page/n11/mode/2up|accessdate=5 February 2012|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Coleco Mini-Arcades Go Gold|journal=Arcade Express|date=August 15, 1982|volume=1|issue=1 |url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/arcadeexpress/arcade_express_v1n1.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2012|page=4}}</ref> In 1983, it released three more Mini-Arcades: for ''Ms. Pac-Man'', ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.|Donkey Kong Junior]]'', and ''[[Zaxxon]]''.<ref name=\"eg_16_10\"/>\n\n[[Image:ColecoVision-wController-L.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[ColecoVision]] video game console]]\n\nColeco returned to the video game console market in 1982 with the launch of the [[ColecoVision]].<ref name=\"NGen15\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Coleco|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31}}</ref> While the system was quite popular, selling 500,000 units over two years,<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: ColecoVision|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31}}</ref> Coleco hedged its bet on video games by introducing a line of [[ROM cartridge]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Intellivision]].

The forces on each side are well-defined, and fight using weapons that primarily target the opponent's military. It is normally fought using conventional weapons, and not with [[chemical weapons|chemical]], [[biological weapons|biological]], or [[nuclear weapons]].\n\nThe general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military, thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]], however, one or both sides may eventually resort to [[unconventional warfare]] tactics.\n\n==Formation of the state==\n\n{{details|State formation}}\nThe state was first advocated by [[Plato]], then found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. European monarchs then gained power as the Catholic Church was stripped of temporal power and was replaced by the [[divine right of kings]]. In 1648, the powers of [[Europe]] signed the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] which ended the religious violence for purely political governance and outlook, signifying the birth of the modern 'state'.\n\nWithin this statist paradigm, only the state and its appointed representatives were allowed to bear [[weapon|arms]] and enter into war. In fact, war was only understood as a conflict between sovereign states. [[Monarch|King]]s strengthened this idea and gave it the force of [[law]]. Whereas previously any [[nobility|noble]] could start a war, the monarchs of Europe of necessity consolidated military power in response to the [[Napoleonic war]].\n\n==The Clausewitzian paradigm==\n\n[[Prussia]] was one country attempting to amass military power. [[Carl von Clausewitz]], one of Prussia's officers, wrote ''[[On War]]'', a work rooted solely in the world of the state. All other forms of intrastate conflict, such as [[rebellion]], are not accounted for because in theoretical terms, Clausewitz could not account for warfare before the state. However, near the end of his life, Clausewitz grew increasingly aware of the importance of non-state military actors. This is revealed in his conceptions of \"the people in arms\" which he noted arose from the same social and political sources as traditional inter-state warfare.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, M.L.R. \"Guerrillas in the mist: reassessing strategy and low intensity warfare\". ''Review of International Studies''. Vol. 29, 19\u201337. 2003</ref>\n\nPractices such as [[Raid (military)|raiding]] or [[feud|blood feuds]] were then labeled criminal activities and stripped of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. This war paradigm reflected the view of most of the modernized world at the beginning of the 21st century, as verified by examination of the conventional armies of the time: large, high maintenance, technologically advanced armies designed to compete against similarly designed forces.\n\nClausewitz also forwarded the issue of [[casus belli]]. While previous wars were fought for social, religious, or even cultural reasons, Clausewitz taught that war is merely \"a continuation of politics by other means.\" It is a rational calculation in which states fight for their interests (whether they are economic, security-related, or otherwise) once normal discourse has broken down.\n\n==Prevalence==\nThe majority of modern wars have been conducted using the means of conventional warfare. Confirmed use of [[biological warfare]] by a nation state has not occurred since 1945, and [[chemical warfare]] has been used only a few times (the latest known confrontation in which it was utilized being the [[Syrian Civil War]]). [[Nuclear warfare]] has only occurred once with the [[United States]] [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing]] the [[Japan]]ese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945.\n\n==Decline==\n{{See also|Nuclear peace}}\nThe state and Clausewitzian principles peaked in the [[World War]]s of the 20th century, but also laid the groundwork for their dilapidation due to [[nuclear proliferation]] and the manifestation of culturally aligned conflict. The nuclear bomb was the result of the state perfecting its quest to overthrow its competitive duplicates. This development seems to have pushed conventional conflict waged by the state to the sidelines. Were two conventional armies to fight, the loser would have redress in its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThus, no two [[nuclear powers]] have yet fought a conventional war [[proxy war|directly]], with the exception of brief skirmishes between for example, United States and China in the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953), China and Russia in the 1969 [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1969)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] and between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the 1999 [[Kargil War]].\n\n==Replacement==\nConventional warfare, which is waged by the state, has become something not worthy of a [[declaration of war]]. Instead, those capable of fighting underneath the nuclear umbrella (supranational [[terrorism|terrorists]], corporate [[mercenaries]], ethnic [[militia]]s, and so on) have now come to dominate the majority of conflict in the [[post-modern]] era. These conflicts cannot be explained under the statist system.{{fact|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has posited that the world in the early 21st century exists as a system of nine distinct \"civilizations\", instead of many [[sovereign state]]s. These civilizations are delineated along cultural lines (for example, Western, [[Islam]]ic, Sinic, [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], and so on). In this way, cultures that have long been dominated by the West are reasserting themselves and looking to challenge the ''status quo''. Thus, culture has replaced the state as the locus of war. This kind of civilizational war, in our time as in times long past, occurs where these cultures buffet up against one another. Some high-profile examples are the Pakistan/India conflict or the battles in the Sudan. This sort of war has defined the field since World War II.{{fact|date=October 2015}}\n\nThese cultural forces will not contend with state-based armies in the traditional way. When faced with battalions of tanks, jets, and missiles, the cultural opponent dissolves away into the population. They benefit from the territorially constrained states, being able to move freely from one country to the next, while states must negotiate with other sovereign states. The state's spy networks are also severely limited by this mobility not constrained by state borders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/24/technology/targeting-terror-intelligence-isis/index.html|title=Technology and the fight against terrorism|last=Segall|first=Erica Fink, Jose Pagliery and Laurie|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n'''Contrast:'''\n* [[Asymmetric warfare]]\n* [[Low-intensity operations]]\n* [[Psychological warfare]]\n* [[Unconventional warfare]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n | year = 2004\n | url = http://www.dni.gov/nic/NIC_2020_2004_05_25_intro.html\n | title = Changing Nature of Warfare\n | work = National Intelligence Council\n | publisher = \n | accessdate = January 30, 2006\n | deadurl = yes\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615205240/http://www.dni.gov/nic/NIC_2020_2004_05_25_intro.html\n | archivedate = June 15, 2006\n | df = \n }}\n* {{cite web\n | author = Stathis Kalyvas\n | year = 2003\n | url = http://www.armedgroups.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=26\n | title = The Sociology of Civil Wars: Warfare and Armed Groups\n | work = Armed Groups Project\n | accessdate = January 30, 2006\n | deadurl = yes\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009064348/http://www.armedgroups.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=26\n | archivedate = October 9, 2006\n | df = \n }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conventional Warfare}}\n[[Category:Warfare by type]]", "sha1": "fnk0otzgn5q4c7g7me84ovv2v3sekjj"}}, {"title": "Chauvinism", "ns": "0", "id": "7312", "revision": {"id": "865709506", "parentid": "863967058", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T17:10:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ihaveacatonmydesk", "id": "22502052"}, "minor": "", "comment": "updated merriam webster", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Nationalism sidebar}}\n{{Populism sidebar}}\n'''Chauvinism''' is a form of extreme [[patriotism]] and a  belief in national superiority and glory.

[A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arendt |first=Hannah |date=October 1945 |title=Imperialism, Nationalism, Chauvinism |journal= The Review of Politics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=457 |doi=10.1017/s0034670500001649}}</ref>}}\n\n==Male chauvinism==\n{{see also|Sexism|Androcentrism|Machismo|Patriarchy|Masculism}}\nMale chauvinism is the belief that [[men]] are superior to [[women]].

As men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war, women started replacing them. After the war ended, men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employments, but they soon realized women had taken over many of their positions to fill the void, says Lloyd.<ref name=\"Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975\">Lloyd, Cynthia B., ed. ''Sex, Discrimination, and the Division of Labor''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1975. Print.</ref>\n\nLloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominate, holding positions of power while women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls, this phenomena could be a result of men being more skilled in their respective areas as well as it could be because their inherent manly nature was preferable for the purposes of productivity. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.<ref name=\"Lloyd, Cynthia B. 1975\"/><ref name=\"Korda, Michael 1973\">[[Michael Korda]], ''Male Chauvinism!

Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the \"potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation\" for women.<ref>Potkay, Charles R., Matthew R.

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results In anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [[self-esteem]].

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<ref name=\"world-building\">{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Gillette| title=World-Building|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=0-89879-707-1}}</ref>\n\nOf the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html| title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon?

The [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance]] of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}</ref>\n\nEven so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents have dramatically fewer possible reactions which severely limits evolution.\n*Thermodynamic stability, the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions, other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen\n*Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere so it is highly unlikely those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]]\n*high solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability)\n* Water is a room temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which are so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n===Ammonia===\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look.]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.B.S. Haldane]] raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.<ref name=\"haldane\">{{Cite journal|author=J.B.S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (-OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book| title=Life Beyond Earth| first=Gerald| last= Feinberg|author2=Robert Shapiro|publisher=Morrow| date=1980|isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 | df =  }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen, and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book| title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints| first=Dirk | last= Schulze-Makuch|first2=Louis Neal|last2=Irwin|publisher=Springer| edition=2| date=2008|isbn= 9783540768166|page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown blue.]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (273&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C (373&nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C (195&nbsp;K) and \u221233&nbsp;\u00b0C (240&nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

Hydrogen sulfide life might use a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They might produce and live off of [[sulfur monoxide]], which is analogous to oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Hydrogen sulfide, like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, suffers from the small temperature range where it is liquid, though that, like that of hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, increases with increasing pressure.\n\n===Silicon dioxide and silicates===\n[[Silicon dioxide]], also known as glass, silica, or quartz, is very abundant in the universe and has a large temperature range where it is liquid. However, its melting point is {{convert|1,600|to|1,725|C|F}}, so it would be impossible to make organic compounds in that temperature, because all of them would decompose.

Our images of creation say a great deal about who we are.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|p=84}}</ref>\n* A \"philosophical and theological elaboration of the primal myth of creation within a religious community. The term myth here refers to the imaginative expression in narrative form of what is experienced or apprehended as basic reality \u2026 The term creation refers to the beginning of things, whether by the will and act of a transcendent being, by emanation from some ultimate source, or in any other way.\"<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142144/creation-myth creation myth], ''Enyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (2009)</ref>\n\nReligion professor [[Mircea Eliade]] defined the word ''myth'' in terms of creation: \n<blockquote>\nMyth narrates a sacred history; it relates an event that took place in primordial Time, the fabled time of the \"beginnings.\" In other words, myth tells how, through the deeds of Supernatural Beings, a reality came into existence, be it the whole of reality, the Cosmos, or only a fragment of reality \u2013 an island, a species of plant, a particular kind of human behavior, an institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Eliade|1964|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Meaning and function==\n[[File:Ba-Gua animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|In [[Chinese creation myth|Daoist creation myth]], \"The Way gave birth to unity; unity gave birth to duality; duality gave birth to trinity; trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures.\" (''[[Daodejing]]'', 4th century BCE)<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1990|pages=9}}</ref>]]\nAll creation myths are in one sense [[etiological]] because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\"/> Myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson.<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/civ/5c.asp Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes].

Central Oregon Community College.</ref>\n\nEthnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}</ref> In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nHistorian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:\n<blockquote>\nEach beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ...

Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:<ref name=\"lm3233\">{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32\u201333}}</ref>\n[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahm\u0101]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u0146u]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]\n\n* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.\n* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.\n* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.\n* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.\n* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.\n* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.\n* Originator deity poised above the abyss.\n* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].\n* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.\n* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.\n\n===''Ex nihilo''===\n{{main article|Ex nihilo}}\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (1480\u201390)]]\n\nThe idea that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 ''[[ex nihilo]]'' \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}\n\n''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1\u20133, 153}}</ref> The [[Debate between sheep and grain]] is an example of an even earlier form of ''ex nihilo'' creation myth from ancient [[Sumer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wasilewska|2000|pages=146}}</ref> In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n===Creation from chaos===\n{{main article|Chaos (cosmogony)}}\nIn creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}</ref> One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n===World parent===\n[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[M\u0101ori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}</ref> One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence===\nIn emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\">{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Creation\"|2011a}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21\u201324}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963}}</ref>  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-diver===\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Earth-Diver Creation\"|2011b}}</ref> Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168\u201370}}</ref><ref>[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (\u0410812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.<ref>{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div

Bradshaw, ''The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship'' (Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd, 2002)]</ref>\n\nThe crucifix is a principal symbol for many groups of [[Christian]]s, and one of the most common forms of the [[Crucifixion in the arts]]. It is especially important in the [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but is also used in the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]], and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], as well as by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Churches.<ref>[http://www.oslchibbing.org/?page_id=43 Our Savior's Lutheran Church, \"Sanctuary and Chapel\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.stjohnlcmstopeka.org/AltarCrucifix.html St. John's Lutheran Church of Topeka, KS, \"The Altar Crucifix\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619074528/http://www.stjohnlcmstopeka.org/AltarCrucifix.html |date=19 June 2012 }}</ref> The symbol is less common in churches of other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]], which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the ''corpus''). The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice \u2014 his death by [[crucifixion]], which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a [[Latin cross]], rather than any other shape, such as a [[Cross of Tau|Tau cross]] or a [[Coptic cross]].\n\nWestern crucifixes usually have a three-dimensional ''corpus'', but in Eastern Orthodoxy Jesus' body is normally painted on the cross, or in low [[relief]]. Strictly speaking, to be a crucifix, the cross must be three-dimensional, but this distinction is not always observed.  An entire painting of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] including a landscape background and other figures is not a crucifix either.\n\nLarge crucifixes high across the central axis of a church are known by the [[Old English]] term [[rood]]. By the late [[Middle Ages]] these were a near-universal feature of Western churches, but are now very rare. Modern Roman Catholic churches often have a crucifix above the [[altar]] on the wall; for the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church requires that, \"on or close to the altar there is to be a cross with a figure of Christ crucified\".<ref>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 117.]</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Holy Saturday.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A crucifix in the [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church.]]\nThe standard, four-pointed Latin crucifix consists of an upright post or ''stipes'' and a single crosspiece to which the sufferer's arms were nailed. There may also be a short projecting [[Titulus (inscription)|nameplate]], showing the letters [[INRI]] (Greek: INBI).  The [[Russian Orthodox]] crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief [[Saint Dismas]] (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief [[Gestas]] (to the viewer's right).  The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or [[low relief]] [[icon]] that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber.  They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and no background.  More sculptural small crucifixes in metal [[relief]] are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as [[pectoral cross]]es and [[blessing cross]]es.\n\nWestern crucifixes may show Christ dead or alive, the presence of the spear wound in his ribs traditionally indicating that he is dead.  In either case his face very often shows his suffering.  In Orthodoxy he has normally been shown as dead since around the end of the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]].<ref>Schiller, Gertrud, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', 1972 (English trans from German), p. 96, Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref> Eastern crucifixes have Jesus' two feet nailed side by side, rather than crossed one above the other, as Western crucifixes have shown them since around the 13th century. The [[crown of thorns]] is also generally absent in Eastern crucifixes, since the emphasis is not on Christ's suffering, but on his triumph over sin and death. The \"S\"-shaped position of Jesus' body on the cross is a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] innovation of the late 10th century,<ref>Schiller, 98-99</ref> though also found in the German [[Gero Cross]] of the same date.  Probably more from Byzantine influence, it spread elsewhere in the West, especially to [[Italy]], by the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, though it was more usual in painting than sculpted crucifixes. It's in Italy that the emphasis was put on Jesus' suffering and realistic details, during a process of general humanization of Christ favored by the [[Franciscan|Franciscan order]]. During the 13th century the suffering Italian model (''Christus patiens'') triumphed over the traditional Byzantine one (''Christus gloriosus'') anywhere in Europe also due to the works of artists such as [[Giunta Pisano]] and [[Cimabue]]. Since the Renaissance the \"S\"-shape is generally much less pronounced.  Eastern Christian blessing crosses will often have the Crucifixion depicted on one side, and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] on the other, illustrating the understanding of [[Orthodox theology]] that the Crucifixion and Resurrection are two intimately related aspects of the same act of salvation.\n\nAnother, symbolic, depiction shows a triumphant Christ ({{lang-la|Christus triumphans}}), clothed in robes, rather than stripped as for His execution, with arms raised, appearing to rise up from the cross, sometimes accompanied by \"rays of light\", or an [[Halo (religious iconography)|aureole]] encircling His Body. He may be robed as a [[prophet]], [[crown (headgear)|crown]]ed as a [[king]], and vested in a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] as [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#High Priest .7C Chief Priest|Great High Priest]].\n\nOn some crucifixes a skull and crossbones are shown below the corpus, referring to Golgotha ([[Calvary]]), the site at which Jesus was crucified, which the Gospels say means in Hebrew \"the place of the skull.\"<ref>In fact this is clearly [[Aramaic]] rather than Hebrew. 'G\u00fblgalt\u00e2' is the Aramaic for 'skull'. The name appears in all of the gospels except Luke, which calls the place simply Kranion 'the Skull', with no Aramaic. See [[Aramaic of Jesus]]</ref>  Medieval tradition held that it was the burial-place of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], and that the cross of Christ was raised directly over Adam's skull, so many crucifixes manufactured in Catholic countries still show the skull and crossbones below the corpus.\n\nVery large crucifixes have been built, the largest being the [[Cross in the Woods]] in Michigan, with a {{convert|31|ft|m}} high statue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Worlds Largest Crucifixion|url=http://www.fishweb.com/maps/cheboygan/indianriver/shrine/index.html|work=Michigan Interactive|publisher=Michigan Interactive|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nPrayer in front of a crucifix, which is seen as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]], is often part of devotion for Christians, especially those worshipping in a church, also privately. The person may sit, stand, or kneel in front of the crucifix, sometimes looking at it in contemplation, or merely in front of it with head bowed or eyes closed. During the Middle Ages small crucifixes, generally hung on a wall, became normal in the personal cells or living quarters first of monks, then all clergy, followed by the homes of the [[laity]], spreading down from the top of society as these became cheap enough for the average person to afford. Most towns had a large crucifix erected as a monument, or some other shrine at the crossroads of the town.  By the 19th century displaying a crucifix somewhere in the general reception areas of a house became typical of Catholic homes. Richer Catholics could afford a room set aside for a chapel.\n\n[[Roman Catholic]] (both Eastern and Western), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran Christians generally use the crucifix in public religious services. They believe use of the crucifix is in keeping with the statement by Saint Paul in Scripture, \"we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God\".<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Cor|1:23-24|ESV}}</ref>\n\nIn the West [[altar cross]]es and [[processional cross]]es began to be crucifixes in the 11th century, which became general around the 14th century, as they became cheaper. The [[Roman Rite]] requires that \"either on the altar or near it, there is to be a cross, with the figure of Christ crucified upon it, a cross clearly visible to the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain near the altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the faithful the saving [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of the Lord.\"<ref>General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 308</ref> The requirement of the altar cross was also mentioned in pre-1970 editions of the [[Roman Missal]],<ref>''Rubricae generales Missalis'', XX</ref> though not in the original 1570 Roman Missal of [[Pope Pius V]].<ref>Manlio Sodi, Achille Maria Triacca, ''Missale Romanum: Editio Princeps (1570)'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1998 {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}})</ref> The Rite of Funerals says that the Gospel Book, the Bible, or a cross (which will generally be in crucifix form) may be placed on the coffin for a [[Requiem Mass]], but a second standing cross is not to be placed near the coffin if the altar cross can be easily seen from the body of the church.<ref>Rite of Funerals, 38</ref>\n\nEastern Christian liturgical processions called [[crucession]]s {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} include a cross or crucifix at their head. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the crucifix is often placed above the [[iconostasis]] in the church. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a large crucifix (\"[[Golgotha]]\") is placed behind the [[Holy Table]] (altar). During [[Matins]] of [[Good Friday]], a large crucifix is taken in procession to the centre of the church, where it is venerated by the faithful. Sometimes the ''soma'' (corpus) is removable and is taken off the crucifix at [[Vespers]] that evening during the [[Gospel]] lesson describing the [[Descent from the Cross]]. The empty cross may then remain in the centre of the church until the [[Paschal vigil]] (local practices vary). The [[blessing cross]] which the [[priest]] uses to bless the faithful at the [[benediction|dismissal]] will often have the crucifix on one side and an [[icon]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] on the other, the side with the Resurrection being used on Sundays and during [[Paschaltide]], and the crucifix on other days.\n\n[[Exorcist]] [[Gabriele Amorth]] has stated that the crucifix is one of the most effective means of averting or opposing [[demons]]. In folklore, it is believed to ward off [[vampires]], [[incubi]], [[succubi]], and other evils.\n\nModern [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] have used an inverted (upside-down) crucifix when showing disdain for [[Jesus Christ]] or the [[Catholic Church]] which believes in [[Divinity of Jesus|his divinity]].<ref>Lucifer Rising: A Book of Sin, Devil Worship and Rock n' Roll (Nemesis, 1994)</ref> According to [[Christian tradition]], [[Saint Peter]] was [[martyr]]ed by being [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].<ref>Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator - 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum''</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Kirche Oberwiesenthal Kruzifixe.jpg|right|thumb|Unlike many other [[Protestants]], [[Lutheran]]s retained the use of the crucifix, Martin Luther church in [[Oberwiesenthal]], Germany ]]\n\n=== Protestant Reformation ===\nThe Lutheran Churches retained the use of the crucifix, \"justifying \"their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.\"<ref name=\"MarquardtJordan2009\">{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71}}</ref> [[Martin Luther]] did not object to them, and this was among his differences with [[Andreas Karlstadt]] as early as 1525.

Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}</ref> In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as \"demoting\" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective.

We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.\"<ref>Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193</ref>\n\nIn cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].<ref name=\"RowanRobinson1996\" /> In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.\n\nModern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.\n\n[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: \"It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.\"<ref name=\"RowanRobinson1996\">{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62\u201363  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}</ref>\n\nBondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].<ref name=\"BondiGold1948\">{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252\u2013270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}</ref>  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].\n\nSince the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with \"the Copernicus method\") for [[J.

Also commonly called the \"'''carp family'''\", or \"'''minnow family'''\", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest [[vertebrate|vertebrate animal]] family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct [[species]] in about 370 [[genus|genera]].<ref name=FB>{{FishBase family | family = Cyprinidae| month = July | year = 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CoF\">{{Cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/SpeciesByFamily.asp#Cyprinidae|title=Species by family/subfamily|last=Eschmeyer|first=W.N.|last2=Fong|first2=J.D.|date=2015|website=[[Catalog of Fishes]]|publisher=California Academy of Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 July 2015}}</ref> The family belongs to the [[ostariophysi]]an order [[Cypriniformes]], of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds.<ref name=\"FB\" /><ref name=CoF/><ref>{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = Joseph | title = Fishes of the World | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-471-25031-7 }}</ref> The family name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kypr\u00eenos'' (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \"carp\").\n\n==Biology and ecology==\nCyprinids are stomachless fish with toothless jaws. Even so, food can be effectively chewed by the [[Gill raker|gill rakers]] of the specialized last gill bow. These [[pharyngeal teeth]] allow the fish to make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a [[Process (anatomy)|bony process]] of the [[skull]]. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the [[common carp]] and [[ide (fish)|ide]] to eat hard baits such as [[snails]] and [[bivalves]].\n\nHearing is a well-developed sense in the cyprinids since they have the [[Weberian organ]], three specialized vertebral processes that transfer motion of the [[gas bladder]] to the inner ear. The vertebral processes of the Weberian organ also permit a cyprinid to detect changes in motion of the [[gas bladder]] due to atmospheric conditions or depth changes. The cyprinids are considered [[physostome]]s because the [[pneumatic duct]] is retained in adult stages and the fish are able to gulp air to fill the gas bladder, or they can dispose excess gas to the gut.\n\n[[File:Giant Barb.jpg|thumb|[[Giant barb]]s (''Catlocarpio siamensis'') are the largest members of this family]]\nCyprinids are native to [[North America]], [[Africa]], and [[Eurasia]]. The largest known cyprinid is the [[giant barb]] (''Catlocarpio siamensis''), which may grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.<ref>{{FishBase species | genus = Catlocarpio | species = siamensis | year = 2015 | month = March}}</ref> Other very large species that can surpass {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} are the [[golden mahseer]] (''Tor putitora'') and [[Mangar (fish)|mangar]] (''Luciobarbus esocinus'').<ref>{{FishBase species | genus = Tor | species = putitora | year = 2017 | month = March}}</ref><ref>{{FishBase species | genus = Luciobarbus | species = esocinus | year = 2017 | month = March}}</ref> The largest North American species is the [[Colorado pikeminnow]] (''Ptychocheilus lucius''), which can reach up to {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>{{FishBase species | genus = Ptychocheilus | species = lucius | year = 2015 | month = March}}</ref> Conversely, many species are smaller than {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}}.

The bitterlings of subfamily [[Acheilognathinae]] are notable for depositing their eggs in bivalve [[Mollusca|molluscs]], where the young develop until able to fend for themselves.\n\nMost cyprinids feed mainly on [[invertebrates]] and [[vegetation]], probably due to the lack of teeth and stomach; however, some species, like the [[Asp (fish)|asp]], are predators that specialize in fish. Many species, such as the [[ide (fish)|ide]] and the [[common rudd]], prey on small fish when individuals become large enough. Even small species, such as the [[moderlieschen]], are opportunistic predators that will eat larvae of the [[common frog]] in artificial circumstances.\n\nSome cyprinids, such as the [[grass carp]], are specialized herbivores; others, such as the [[common nase]], eat algae and [[biofilm]]s, while others, such as the [[black carp]], specialize in snails, and some, such as the [[silver carp]], are specialized [[filter feeders]]. For this reason, cyprinids are often introduced as a management tool to control various factors in the aquatic environment, such as aquatic vegetation and diseases transmitted by snails.\n\nUnlike most fish species, cyprinids generally increase in abundance in [[eutrophic]] lakes. Here, they contribute towards positive feedback as they are efficient at eating the [[zooplankton]] that would otherwise graze on the algae, reducing its abundance.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\n{{Anchor|Relationship with humans}}\n[[File:Cyprinids wild capture.png|thumb|300px|right|<center>Wild capture of cyprinids by species in million tonnes, 1950\u20132009, as reported by the FAO<ref name=\"faostat\">Based on data sourced from the [http://faostat.fao.org/site/629/default.aspx FishStat database]</ref></center>]]\n\nCyprinids are highly important food fish; they are [[fishing|fished]] and [[fish farming|farmed]] across [[Eurasia]]. In [[land-locked]] countries in particular, cyprinids are often the major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of [[biomass]] in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive [[frozen food|frozen]] fish products made this less important now than it was in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as [[angling|recreational fishing]], and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fishlore: British Freshwater Fishes|last=MacMahon|first=Alexander Francis Magri|date=1946|publisher=Penguin Books|year=|isbn=|series=Pelican Books|volume=161|location=|pages=149\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nCyprinids are popular for angling especially for [[match fishing]] (due to their dominance in biomass and numbers) and fishing for [[common carp]] because of its size and strength.\n\nSeveral cyprinids have been introduced to waters outside their natural ranges to provide food, sport, or biological control for some [[pest (organism)|pest]] species. The common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') and the grass carp (''Ctenopharyngodon idella'') are the most important of these, for example in [[Florida]]. In some cases, such as the [[Asian carp]] in the [[Mississippi Basin]], they have become [[invasive species]] that compete with native fishes or disrupt the environment. Carp in particular can stir up [[sediment]], reducing the clarity of the water and making it difficult for plants to grow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet2.php?toc_id=183|title=Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758)|last=[[Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission]]|first=|date=3 August 2005|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818063036/http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet2.php?toc_id=183|archive-date=18 August 2007|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://floridafisheries.com/Fishes/non-native.html|title=Exotic Freshwater Fishes|last=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|first=|date=2006|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208232238/http://floridafisheries.com/Fishes/non-native.html|archive-date=8 February 2007|dead-url=|access-date=5 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous cyprinids have become important in the [[fishkeeping|aquarium and fishpond]] hobbies, most famously the [[goldfish]], which was bred in China from the [[Prussian carp]] (''Carassius (auratus) gibelio''). First imported into Europe around 1728, it was much fancied by Chinese nobility as early as 1150{{nbsp}}AD and after it arrived there in 1502, also in [[Japan]]. In the latter country, from the 18th century onwards, the common carp was bred into the ornamental variety known as [[koi]] &ndash; or more accurately {{Nihongo|2=\u9326\u9bc9|3=nishikigoi}}, as {{Nihongo|2=\u9bc9|3=koi}} simply means \"common carp\" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].\n\nOther popular aquarium cyprinids include [[danionin]]s, [[danionin|rasborines]], and [[Barbinae|true barbs]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aquarium Atlas Volume 1|last=Riehl|first=R.|last2=Baensch|first2=H.|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=410}}</ref> Larger species are bred by the thousands in outdoor ponds, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], and trade in these aquarium fishes is of considerable commercial importance.

In particular, the cyprinids of the subfamily [[Leuciscinae]] from southwestern North America have been hit hard by [[pollution]] and unsustainable water use in the early to mid-20th century; most globally extinct [[Cypriniformes|cypriniform]] species are in fact leuciscinid cyprinids from the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n==Systematics==\nThe massive diversity of cyprinids has so far made it difficult to resolve their [[phylogeny]] in sufficient detail to make assignment to [[subfamilies]] more than tentative in many cases. Some distinct lineages obviously exist &ndash; for example, the [[Cultrinae]] and Leuciscinae, regardless of their exact delimitation, are rather close relatives and stand apart from [[Cyprininae]]{{snds}}but the overall [[systematics]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the Cyprinidae remain a subject of considerable debate.

Other \"rasborines\" are apparently distributed across the diverse lineages of the family.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe validity and circumscription of proposed subfamilies like the [[Labeoninae]] or [[Squaliobarbinae]] also remain doubtful, although the latter do appear to correspond to a distinct lineage.

('''cDNA''') is [[DNA]] synthesized from a single stranded RNA (e.g., messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]) or [[microRNA]]) template in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. cDNA is often used to clone [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[gene]]s in [[prokaryote]]s.  When scientists want to [[gene expression|express]] a specific [[protein]] in a cell that does not normally express that protein (i.e., [[heterologous]] expression), they will transfer the cDNA that codes for the protein to the recipient cell.  cDNA is also produced naturally by [[retroviruses]] (such as [[HIV-1]], [[HIV-2]], [[simian immunodeficiency virus]], etc.) and then integrated into the host's genome, where it creates a [[provirus]].<ref name=CroyNotes1998>{{cite web|last1=Croy|first1=Ron|title=Molecular Genetics II - Genetic Engineering Course (Supplementary notes)|url=http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869N/CHEM869NLinks/www.dur.ac.uk/~dbl0www/Staff/Croy/cDNAfigs.htm|website=Durham University durham.ac.uk; 20 April 1998|accessdate=4 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824023822/http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dbl0www/Staff/Croy/cDNAfigs.htm|archivedate=2002-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''cDNA'' is also used, typically in a [[bioinformatics]] context, to refer to an mRNA transcript's sequence, expressed as DNA bases (GCAT) rather than RNA bases (GCAU).\n\ncDNA is derived from mRNA, so it contains only [[exons]], with no [[introns]].\n\n==Synthesis==\nAlthough there are several methods for doing so, cDNA is most often synthesized from mature (fully spliced) mRNA using the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This enzyme, which naturally occurs in retroviruses, operates on a single strand of mRNA, generating its complementary DNA based on the pairing of RNA [[base pair]]s (A, U, G and C) to their DNA complements (T, A, C and G, respectively).\n\nTo obtain eukaryotic cDNA whose introns have been removed:\n# A eukaryotic cell transcribes the DNA (from genes) into RNA ([[pre-mRNA]]).\n# The same cell processes the pre-mRNA strands by removing introns, and adding a [[Polyadenylation|poly-A tail]] and [[5' cap|5\u2019 Methyl-Guanine cap]] (this is known as [[post-transcriptional modification]])\n# This mixture of mature mRNA strands is extracted from the cell. The [[Polyadenylation|poly-A tail]] of the post-transcriptional mRNA can be taken advantage of with oligo(dT) beads in an [[affinity chromatography]] assay.\n# A poly-[[thymine|T]] [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] is hybridized onto the [[Polyadenylation|poly-A tail]]  of the mature mRNA template, or [[random hexamer]] primers can be added which contain every possible 6 base single strand of DNA and can therefore hybridize anywhere on the RNA (Reverse transcriptase requires this double-stranded segment as a primer to start its operation.)\n# [[Reverse transcriptase]] is added, along with [[deoxynucleotide triphosphate]]s ([[Adenine|A]], T, [[Guanine|G]], C). This synthesizes one complementary strand of DNA hybridized to the original mRNA strand.\n# To synthesize an additional DNA strand, traditionally one would digest the RNA of the hybrid strand, using an enzyme like [[RNase H]], or through alkali digestion method. \n# After digestion of the RNA, a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) is left and because single stranded nucleic acids are hydrophobic, it tends to loop around itself. It is likely that the ssDNA forms a [[hairpin loop]] at the 3' end.\n# From the hairpin loop, a DNA polymerase can then use it as a primer to transcribe a complementary sequence for the ss cDNA.\n# Now, you should be left with a double stranded cDNA with identical sequence as the mRNA of interest.\n\n==Applications==\nComplementary DNA is often used in [[clone (genetics)|gene cloning]] or as [[gene probe]]s or in the creation of a [[cDNA library]]. When scientists transfer a gene from one cell into another cell in order to express the new genetic material as a protein in the recipient cell, the cDNA will be added to the recipient (rather than the entire gene), because the DNA for an entire gene may include DNA that does not code for the protein or that interrupts the coding sequence of the protein (e.g., [[intron]]s). Partial sequences of cDNAs are often obtained as '''[[expressed sequence tag]]s (EST)'''.\n\nWith amplification of DNA sequences via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) now commonplace, one will typically conduct reverse transcription as an initial step, followed by PCR to obtain an exact sequence of cDNA for intra-cellular expression. This is achieved by designing sequence-specific DNA primers that hybridize to the 5' and 3' ends of a cDNA region coding for a protein. Once amplified, the sequence can be cut at each end with nucleases and inserted into one of many small circular DNA sequences known as expression vectors. Such vectors allow for self-replication, inside the cells, and potentially integration in the host DNA. They typically also contain a strong promoter to drive transcription of the target cDNA into mRNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nOn June 13, 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in the case of ''[[Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics]]'' that while naturally occurring human genes cannot be [[patent]]ed, cDNA is patent eligible because it does not occur naturally.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Rules Human Genes May Not Be Patented|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/supreme-court-rules-human-genes-may-not-be-patented.html|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Viruses==\nSome viruses also use cDNA to turn their viral RNA into mRNA (viral RNA \u2192 cDNA \u2192 mRNA). The mRNA is used to make viral proteins to take over the host cell.\n\nAn example of this first step from viral DNA to cDNA can be seen in the HIV cycle of infection. Here, the host cell membrane becomes attached to the virus\u2019 lipid envelope which allows the viral capsid with two copies of viral genome RNA to enter the host. The cDNA copy is then made though reverse transcription of the viral RNA, a process facilitated by the chaperone CypA and a viral capsid associated reverse transcriptase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Altfeld|first=Marcus|last2=Jr|first2=Michael Gale|date=2015-06-01|title=Innate immunity against HIV-1 infection|url=http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v16/n6/box/ni.3157_BX1.html|journal=Nature Immunology|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=554\u2013562|doi=10.1038/ni.3157|issn=1529-2908}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[cDNA library]]\n*[[cDNA microarray]]\n*[[RNA-Seq]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.h-invitational.jp/ H-Invitational Database]\n* [http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/ Functional Annotation of the Mouse database]\n* [http://www.bugaco.com/calculators/dna_reverse_complement.php Complementary DNA tool]\n{{Nucleic acids}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Complementary Dna}}\n[[Category:DNA]]", "sha1": "3u59nbcut2nvzlav3x0ov1vro1eqw5s"}}, {"title": "Cellular digital packet data", "ns": "0", "id": "7331", "revision": {"id": "800312267", "parentid": "754239745", "timestamp": "2017-09-12T19:05:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "\u8efd\u5feb", "id": "21560324"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|CDPD|British copyright law|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n'''Cellular Digital Packet Data''' ('''CDPD''') was a wide-area mobile data service which used unused [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] normally used by [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] [[mobile phone]]s between 800 and 900&nbsp;MHz to transfer data. Speeds up to 19.2 kbit/s were possible. The service was discontinued in conjunction with the retirement of the parent AMPS service; it has been functionally replaced by faster services such as [[1xRTT]], [[EV-DO]], and [[UMTS]]/[[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]].\n\nDeveloped in the early 1990s, CDPD was large on the horizon as a future technology. However, it had difficulty competing against existing slower but less expensive [[Mobitex]] and [[DataTac]] systems, and never quite gained widespread acceptance before newer, faster standards such as [[GPRS]] became dominant.\n\nCDPD had very limited consumer products. [[AT&T Wireless]] first sold the technology in the United States under the PocketNet brand. It was one of the first products of wireless web service. Digital Ocean, Inc. an OEM licensee of the Apple Newton, sold the Seahorse product, which integrated the Newton handheld computer, an AMPS/CDPD handset/modem along with a web browser in 1996, winning the CTIA's hardware product of the year award as a smartphone, arguably the world's first.  A company named [[OmniSky]] provided service for Palm V devices. Omnisky  OmniSky then file bankrupt in 2001 then was picked up by EarthLink Wireless the technician that developed the tech support for all of the wireless technology was a man by the name of Myron Feasel he was brought from company to company endind up at Palm. Wireless later sold CDPD under the Wireless Internet brand (not to be confused with Wireless Internet Express, their brand for GPRS/EDGE data). PocketNet was generally considered a failure with competition from 2G services such as Sprint's Wireless Web. AT&T Wireless sold four PocketNet Phone models to the public: the Samsung Duette and the Mitsubishi MobileAccess-120 were AMPS/CDPD PocketNet phones introduced in October 1997; and two IS-136/CDPD Digital PocketNet phones, the Mitsubishi T-250 and the Ericsson R289LX.\n\nDespite its limited success as a consumer offering, CDPD was adopted in a number of enterprise and government networks. It was particularly popular as a first-generation wireless data solution for [[telemetry]] devices (machine to machine communications) and for public safety mobile data terminals.\n\nIn 2004, major carriers in the [[United States]] announced plans to shut down CDPD service. In July 2005, the [[AT&T Wireless]] and [[Cingular Wireless]] CDPD networks were shut down. Equipment for this service now has little to no residual value.\n\n==CDPD Network and system==\nPrimary elements of a CDPD network are:\n1. '''End systems''': physical & logical end systems that exchange information\n2. '''Intermediate systems''': CDPD infrastructure elements that store, forward & route the information\n\nThere are 2 kinds of End systems\n1. '''Mobile end system''': subscriber unit to access CDPD network over a wireless interface\n2. '''Fixed end system''': common host/server that is connected to the CDPD backbone and providing access to specific application and data\n\nThere are 2 kinds of Intermediate systems\n1. '''Generic intermediate system''': simple router with no knowledge of mobility issues\n2. '''mobile data intermediate system''': specialized intermediate system that routes data based on its knowledge of the current location of Mobile end system. It is a set of hardware and software functions that provide switching, accounting, registration, authentication, encryption, and so on.\n\nThe design of CDPD was based on several design objectives that are often repeated in designing overlay networks or new networks. A lot of emphasis was laid on open architectures and reusing as much of the existing RF infrastructure as possible. The design goal of CDPD included location independence and independence fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}}, service provider, so that coverage could be maximized ; application transparency and multiprotocol support, interoperability between products from multiple vendors.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cio.com/archive/060197/et.html CIO CDPD article]\n* [http://www.emory.edu/BUSINESS/et/cdpd/ History and Development]\n* [http://webmasters-forums.com/showthread.php?tid=393 Detailed Description About CDPD]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile telecommunications]]", "sha1": "gil094fuhcaot91h0ql0m6qa0oi5zlu"}}, {"title": "Chimera", "ns": "0", "id": "7333", "revision": {"id": "860676116", "parentid": "859964564", "timestamp": "2018-09-22T08:55:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "comment": "surname tag", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|Chimera|chimera|chimeric|cimera|monkey boy}}\n\n'''Chimera''', '''chimaera''', or '''chimaira''' may refer to:\n* [[Chimera (mythology)]], a monstrous creature with parts from multiple animals\n* [[Mount Chimaera]], the region in Lycia that some believe was an inspiration for the myth\n\n{{TOC right}}\n==People==\n* [[Jason Chimera]] (born 1979), NHL ice hockey forward for the Washington Capitals\n* [[Mike Dred]] or Chimera (born 1967), techno musician\n* [[Ricardo Rodriguez (wrestler)]] or Chimaera (born 1986), professional wrestler\n\n==Science==\n* [[Chimaera]], any of various cartilaginous fishes of the order Chimaeriformes\n** [[Chimaera (genus)|''Chimaera'' (genus)]], the eponymous genus of the order Chimaeriformes\n* [[Chimera (EST)]], a single cDNA sequence originating from two transcripts\n* [[Chimera (genetics)]], a single animal or plant with genetically distinct cells from two different zygotes\n* [[Chimera (paleontology)]], a fossil which was reconstructed with parts from different animals\n* [[Chimera (virus)]], a virus containing genetic material from other organisms\n* Chimera, or [[fusion protein]], a hybrid protein made by the splicing of two genes\n\n==Arts and entertainment==\n===Fictional entities===\n* [[Chimera (Fullmetal Alchemist)]], characters in ''Fullmetal Alchemist''\n* [[Chimera (Marvel Comics)]], a Marvel Comics character\n* [[Chimera (Dungeons & Dragons)|Chimera (''Dungeons & Dragons'')]], a magical beast in ''Dungeons & Dragons''\n* [[Chimera Anima]], a name grouping of animals in the anime ''Tokyo Mew Mew''\n* The Chimera, an alien race in ''[[Resistance (video game series)#The Chimera|Resistance]]''\n\n===Films===\n* [[Chimera (1968 film)|''Chimera'' (1968 film)]], an Italian musicarello film\n* [[Chimera (2001 film)|''Chimera'' (2001 film)]], an Italian romance film\n* [[Chim\u00e8re (film)|''Chim\u00e8re'' (film)]], a 1989 French film\n* [[Chim\u00e8res (film)|''Chim\u00e8res'' (film)]], a 2013 French-language film\n\n===Gaming===\n* [[Chimera (video game)|''Chimera'' (video game)]], a 1985 isometric maze arcade adventure\n* [[Chimera (larp convention)]], a convention in Auckland, New Zealand\n* [[Chicago Chimera]], a professional electronic sports gaming franchise\n* [[Chimera Entertainment]], a game development studio in Munich, Germany\n\n===Literature===\n<!--There is general consensus (see talk page) that chimaeras which are not important enough to a fiction to be mentioned in that article should not be mentioned here.

Creatures of statute may include [[Municipality|municipalities]] and other artificial legal entities or relationships.<ref name=\"quaqua1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm |title=Creature of the State |website=Quaqua Society}}</ref> Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body\u2014often for governmental purposes\u2014such bodies when formed are known as \"creatures of statute.\" The same concept is also expressed with the phrase \"creature of the state.\"<ref name=\"quaqua1\"/>\n\nThe term \"creature of statute\" is most common to the [[United States]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], these bodies are simply called [[statutory corporation]]s (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the [[Companies Act 1985]] specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (''e.g.'', a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as \"creatures of statute\" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. [[Australia]] also uses the term \"creature of statute\" to describe some governmental bodies.\n\nThe importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body.

''Cowboy Bebop'' explores philosophical concepts including [[existentialism]], [[boredom|existential ennui]], and [[loneliness]].\n\nThe [[television program|series]] premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on [[WOWOW]] from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two [[manga]] series which were serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s [[Asuka Fantasy DX]]. A [[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|film]] was later released to theaters worldwide.\n\nThe anime series was dubbed in the [[English language]] by [[Animaze]] and ZRO Limit Productions, and was licensed by [[Bandai Entertainment]] in North America and is now licensed by [[Funimation]]. In Britain, it was licensed by [[Beez Entertainment]] and is currently licensed by [[Anime Limited]]. [[Madman Entertainment]] has licensed it for releases in Australia and New Zealand. In 2001, ''Cowboy Bebop'' became the first anime title to be broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States.\n\n''Cowboy Bebop'' became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets (most notably in the United States), garnered several major anime and [[science fiction awards]] upon its release, and received wide acclaim for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics have hailed ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime titles of all time. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, ''Cowboy Bebop'' has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.<ref name=\"avclub-2009\">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |title=Gateways To Geekery: Anime |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gateways-to-geekery-anime,24653/ |work= ''[[The A.V.

Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as \"Cowboys\") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward.<ref name=\"CowboyBackground\">{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop - Original Sessions - Background |url=http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |publisher=CowboyBebop.Org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030107060711/http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |archivedate= January 7, 2003 }}</ref> The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship ''Bebop''.

Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, but when Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]] and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her, Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia goes into hiding to protect herself and Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to complete their plan. Vicious, having staged a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' and taken over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. His heartbreak feeds his desire to kill Vicious once and for all. Spike leaves the ''Bebop'' after saying a final goodbye to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to get mortally wounded in the ensuing confrontation. The series ultimately concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun. He eventually falls to the ground, leaving his true fate ambiguous.\n\n==Genre and themes==\nWatanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it \"a new genre unto itself\". The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts. Later, Watanabe called the phrase an \"exaggeration\".<ref name=\"CowboyMag\"/> The show is a hybrid of multiple [[genre]]s, including [[comedy]], the [[Caper story|detective caper]], [[action fiction]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], and [[film noir]].

Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.<ref name= \"WatanabeInterview3\"/> The reason for creating the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like ''[[Star Trek]]'', with him being tied to doing it for years.<ref name= \"AODinterview\"/>\n\n===Development===\nThe project had initially originated with [[Bandai]]'s toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys. Watanabe recalled his only instruction was \"So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want.\" But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series didn't match with that of Bandai's. Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in [[development hell]] until sister company [[Bandai Visual]] stepped in to sponsor it. Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series.<ref name=\"WatanabePanel\"/> Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults.<ref name=\"AWNcowboy\"/> During the making of ''Bebop'', Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later. While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect. He joked that if Bandai Visual hadn't intervened then \"you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now.\"<ref name=\"WatanabePanel\"/>\n\nThe city locations were generally inspired by the cities of [[New York City|New York]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref name= \"WatanabeInterview1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html|title=The Director's Voice: Shinichiro Watanabe Interview|publisher=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie website (English)|accessdate=January 6, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html|archivedate=March 7, 2003|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The atmospheres of the planets and the ethnic groups in ''Cowboy Bebop'' mostly originated from Watanabe's ideas, with some collaboration from set designers [[Isamu Imakake]], [[Shoji Kawamori]], and [[Dai Sat\u014d]]. The animation staff established the particular planet atmospheres early in the production of the series before working on the ethnic groups. It was Watanabe who wanted to have several groups of ethnic diversity appear in the series. [[Mars]] was the planet most often used in ''Cowboy Bebop''{{'}}s storylines, with Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explaining that the other planets \"were unexpectedly difficult to use.\" He stated that each planet in the series had unique features, and the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet in the story. For the final episode, Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff to have the dramatic rooftop scene occur on [[Venus]], so the staff \"ended up normally falling back to Mars.\"<ref name=\"AnimeGuide4p64\">{{cite book |author=[[Newtype]]|title=Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4|date=May 21, 2002|page=64|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|isbn=1-931514-08-9}}</ref> In creating the backstory, Watanabe envisioned a world that was \"multinational rather than stateless\".

The genres she used for its composition were western, opera and jazz.<ref name= \"AODinterview\"/> Watanabe noted that Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to. He stated, \"She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for ''Cowboy Bebop'',' and composes something completely on her own.\"<ref name=\"WataToon\"/> Kanno herself was sometimes surprised at how pieces of her music were used in scenes, sometimes wishing it had been used elsewhere, though she also felt that none of their uses were \"inappropriate\". She was pleased with the working environment, finding the team very relaxed in comparison with other teams she had worked with.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\nWatanabe further explained that he would take inspiration from Kanno's music after listening to it and create new scenes for the story from it. These new scenes in turn would inspire Kanno and give her new ideas for the music and she would come to Watanabe with even more music. Watanabe cited as an example, \"some songs in the second half of the series, we didn't even ask her for those songs, she just made them and brought them to us.\" He commented that while Kanno's method was normally \"unforgivable and unacceptable,\" it was ultimately a \"big hit\" with ''Cowboy Bebop''.

Miguel Douglas, describing the series style in a review, said that \"the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional [[Anime|Japanese animation]] and instead chooses to forge its own path. With a setting within the realm of [[science fiction]], the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time. Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general \u2014 whether that be [[Extraterrestrial life|space aliens]], giant [[robot]]s, or [[laser gun]]s \u2014 the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances. Certainly not as pristine a future we would see in other series or films, ''Cowboy Bebop'' decides to deliver a future that closely reflects that of our own time. This aspect of familiarity does wonders in terms of relating to the viewer, and it presents a world that certainly resembles our very own.\"<ref name=\"iSreview\">{{cite web|title=Anime Review: Cowboy Bebop - \u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 - Kaub\u014di Bibappu|date=September 1, 2010|last=Douglas|first=Miguel|publisher=iSugoi|url=http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|accessdate=May 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113081241/http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|archivedate=November 13, 2011|df=}}</ref> Daryl Surat of ''[[Otaku USA]]'', commenting on the series' appeal, said that it was \"that rare breed of science-fiction: \"accessible\".

It even approached its music differently. The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song, and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres, from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk, it's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all\". In an interview, producer Sean Akins also states that the series \"created a whole new world\". \"It's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had. It changed anime.

I think it redefined cool within animation, not only in Japan but in the States\".<ref name=atlantic/>\n\nAmerican film director, screenwriter, and producer [[Rian Johnson]] has cited ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a visual influence on his films, most notably ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]''.<ref name=\"visuals\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rcjohnso.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2350&sid=587c10758d5009ad4225fcaa91ef524b#p2350\n| title = The Visuals of Brick\n| first = Rian |last=Johnson\n| work = Rian's Forum\n| publisher=rcjohnso.com\n| date = April 19, 2006\n| accessdate = 2007-03-09\n}}</ref> ''[[Ender's Game]]'' writer, novelist, critic, playwright, and poet [[Orson Scott Card]] also praised the series.

Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he \"should just keep on making ''Cowboy Bebop'' sequels for the sake of it\".

A convert to Christianity, he was an educated man who was familiar with [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]]. As his three major works demonstrate, Clement was influenced by Hellenistic philosophy to a greater extent than any other Christian thinker of his time, and in particular by [[Plato]] and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].<ref>Outler (1940), p. 217</ref> His secret works, which exist only in fragments, suggest that he was also familiar with pre-Christian [[Judaism|Jewish]] esotericism and [[Gnosticism]]. In one of his works he argued that Greek philosophy had its origin among non-Greeks, claiming that both Plato and [[Pythagoras]] were taught by Egyptian scholars.<ref>Press (2003), p. 83</ref> Among his pupils were [[Origen]] and [[Alexander of Jerusalem]].\n\nClement is usually regarded as a [[Church Father]]. He is venerated as a [[saint]] in [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]], [[Ethiopian Christianity]] and [[Anglicanism]]. He was previously revered in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but his name was removed from the [[Roman Martyrology]] in 1586 by [[Pope Sixtus V]] on the advice of [[Baronius]].\n\n==Biography==\nNeither Clement's birthdate or birthplace is known with any degree of certainty. It is conjectured that he was born sometime around 150 CE.   According to [[Epiphanius Scholasticus]], he was born in Athens, but there is also a tradition of an [[Alexandria]]n birth.<ref name=Fer1974-13>Ferguson (1974), p. 13</ref><ref>Westcott (1877), p. 560</ref>\n\nHis parents were [[paganism|pagans]], and Clement was a convert to Christianity. In the ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' he displays an extensive knowledge of Greek mythology and [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], which could only have arisen from the practice of his family's religion.<ref name=Fer1974-13/>\n\nHaving rejected paganism as a young man due to its perceived moral corruption, he travelled in [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]]. Clement's journeys were primarily a religious undertaking. In Greece, he encountered an [[Ionia]]n theologian, who has been identified as [[Athenagoras of Athens]]; while in the east, he was taught by an Assyrian, sometimes identified with [[Tatian]], and a Jew, who was possibly [[Theophilus, bishop of Caesarea|Theophilus of Caesarea]].<ref name=Fer1974-14>Ferguson (1974), p. 14</ref>\n\nIn around 180, Clement reached [[Alexandria]],<ref>''Stromateis'' 1.1.11.2</ref> where he met [[Pantaenus]], who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria.<ref>Eusebius, ''Eccl. Hist''. 6.13.2; 6.6.1</ref> [[Eusebius]] suggests that Pantaenus was the head of the school, but it is controversial whether the institutions of the school were formalized in this way before the time of [[Origen]].<ref name=Fer1974-15>Ferguson (1974), p. 15</ref><ref>H\u00e4gg (2006), p. 56-9. Proponents of a formalized leadership and succession suggest that Clement succeeded Pantaenus as leader of the school, and was succeeded himself by Origen; see Itter (2009), pp. 9-10.</ref><ref>Osborn (2008), pp. 19-24.</ref> Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by [[Pope Julian of Alexandria|Pope Julian]] before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's life in Alexandria. He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.<ref name=Fer1974-16>Ferguson (1974), p. 16</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Septimius Severus#Religious matters|Severian persecutions]] of 202\u2013203, Clement left Alexandria. In 211, [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] wrote a letter commending him to the Church of [[Antioch]],<ref>Eusebius, ''Eccl.

Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]] are used as an example of the false cults of Greek paganism in the ''Protrepticus''. ]]\nThe ''Protrepticus'' is, as its title suggests, an exhortation to the pagans of Greece to adopt Christianity, and within it Clement demonstrates his extensive knowledge of pagan mythology and theology. It is chiefly important due to Clement's exposition of religion as an anthropological phenomenon.<ref name=Dro1989138>Droge (1989), p. 138</ref> After a short philosophical discussion, it opens with a history of Greek religion in seven stages.<ref>Droge (1989), p. 130</ref> Clement suggests that at first, men mistakenly believed [[Sky deity|the Sun, the Moon and other heavenly bodies]] to be gods. The next development was the worship of the products of agriculture, from which he contends the cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]] arose.<ref name=Dro1989131>Droge (1989), p. 131</ref> Man then paid reverence to revenge, and deified human feelings of [[eros|love]] and [[Phobos (mythology)|fear]], among others. In the following stage, the poets [[Hesiod]] and [[Homer]] attempt to enumerate the Gods; Hesiod's [[Theogony]] giving the number of twelve. Finally, men proclaimed other men, such as [[Asclepius]] and [[Heracles]], deities.<ref name=Dro1989131/> Discussing [[idolatry]], Clement contends that the objects of primitive religion were unshaped wood and stone, and idols thus arose when such natural items were carved.<ref name = Fer197448>Ferguson (1974), p. 48</ref> Following [[Plato]], Clement is critical of all forms of visual art, suggesting that artworks are but illusions and \"deadly toys\".<ref name = Fer197448/>\n\nClement criticizes Greek paganism in the ''Protrepticus'' on the basis that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery religions for their obscurantism and trivial rituals.<ref name = Fer197448/> In particular, the worshippers of [[Dionysus]] are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's [[toy]]s.<ref>Burrus (2011), p. 101</ref> He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are [[misanthropic]] demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 50</ref> Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about [[Euhemerus]] and other rationalist philosophers, on the grounds that they at least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] views of God prefigure Christianity.<ref>Ferguson (1974), pp. 55\u20136</ref>\n\nThe figure of [[Orpheus]] is prominent throughout the narrative, and Clement contrasts his song, representing pagan superstition, with the divine [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] of Christ.<ref>de J\u00e1uregui (2010), p. 132</ref> According to Clement, through conversion to Christianity alone can man fully participate in the Logos, which is universal truth.<ref>Sharkey (2009), p. 159</ref>\n\n====''Paedagogus''====\n{{main|Paedagogus}}\n[[File:Jesus-Christ-from-Hagia-Sophia.jpg|thumb|left|Christ, the Logos incarnate, is the ''Paedagogus'' of the work's title.]]\nThis work's title, translatable as \"tutor\", refers to Christ as the teacher of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 76</ref> It is not simply instructional : the author intends to show how the Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically.<ref>Osborn (2008), p. 244</ref> Clement, following Plato ([[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the ''Protrepticus'', he devotes the ''Paedagogus'' to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to control our passions.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 69</ref> Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|pagan literature]]; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.<ref>Irvine (2006), p. 164</ref>\n\nAlthough Christ, like man, is made in the [[image of God]], he alone shares the likeness of God the Father.<ref>Ogliari (2003), p. 200</ref> Christ is both [[sinless]] and [[Apatheia|apathetic]], and thus by striving to [[imitation of Christ|imitate Christ]], man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational [\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd], removed only through the wisdom of the Logos.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 71</ref> God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of [[Love of God|God's universal love for mankind]]. The word play on \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the [[Epicurus|Epicurean]] belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 73</ref>\n\nClement argues for the [[gender equality|equality of sexes]], on the grounds that salvation is extended to all of mankind equally.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 72</ref> Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the [[eucharist]] is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father.<ref name=Ma2004184>Gill (2004), p. 184</ref><ref>Berger (2011), pp. 74\u20135</ref> He is supportive of women playing an active role in the leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the ''Paedagogus'' were influenced by [[Gnosticism]].<ref name=Ma2004184/> However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that [[faith]], not esoteric knowledge [\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2], is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 75</ref>\n\nIn the second book, Clement provides practical rules on living a Christian life. He argues against overindulgence in food and in favour of good [[table manners]].<ref name=Fer197480>Ferguson (1974), p. 80</ref> While prohibiting drunkenness, he promotes the drinking of alcohol in moderation following {{Bibleverse|1|Timothy|5:23|KJV}}.<ref name=Fer197480/> Clement argues for a simple way of life in accordance with the innate simplicity of Christian [[monotheism]]. He condemns elaborate and expensive furnishings and clothing, and argues against overly passionate music and perfumes. But Clement does not believe in the abandoning of worldly pleasures and argues that the Christian should be able to express his joy in God's creation through gaiety and partying.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 82</ref> He opposes the wearing of garlands, because the picking of the flowers ultimately kills a beautiful creation of God, and the garland resembles the [[crown of thorns]].<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 85</ref> Clement treats [[sex]] at some length. He argues that both [[promiscuity]] and [[sexual abstinence]] are unnatural, and that the main goal of [[human sexuality]] is procreation.<ref>Kochuthara (2007) , p. 145</ref> [[Homosexuality]], [[prostitution]], [[concubinage]], [[adultery]] and coitus with pregnant women should all be avoided as they will not act towards the generation of legitimate offspring.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 87</ref>\n\nThe third book continues along a similar vein, condemning [[cosmetics]] on the grounds that it is our souls, not our bodies, that we should seek to beautify.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 91</ref> Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male [[depilation]] as [[effeminate|effeminacy]]. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 94</ref> The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a [[hymn]].<ref>Murphy (1941), p. 32</ref>\n\n====''Stromata''====\n[[File:Alpine flora logan pass.jpg|thumb|right|Clement describes the ''Stromata'' as a work on various subjects, which spring up in the text like flowers in a meadow.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 107</ref>]]\n{{main| Stromata}}\nThe contents of the ''Stromata'', as its title suggests, are miscellaneous. Its place in the trilogy is disputed \u2013 Clement initially intended to write the ''Didasculus'', a work which would complement the practical guidance of the ''Paedagogus'' with a more intellectual schooling in theology.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 106</ref> The ''Stromata'' is less systematic and ordered than Clement's other works, and it has been theorized by Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9hat that it was intended for a limited, esoteric readership.<ref>Osborn (2008), p. 8</ref> Although [[Eusebius]] wrote of eight books of the work, only seven undoubtably survive. [[Photius]], writing in the 9th century, found various text appended to manuscripts of the seven canonical books, which lead [[Daniel Heinsius]] to suggest that the original eighth book is lost, and he identified the text purported to be from the eighth book as fragments of the ''Hypopotoses''.<ref>Kaye (1835), p. 221</ref>\n\nThe first book starts on the topic of Greek philosophy. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a [[propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] role for the Greek, similar to the function of the [[Torah|law]] for [[Judaism|the Jews]].<ref>Ferguson (1974), pp. 108\u20139</ref> He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that [[Jewish culture]] was the most significant influence on Greece.<ref>Ferguson (1974), pp. 113\u20136</ref> In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of [[Moses]], Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.<ref>Ferguson (1974), pp. 117\u20139</ref>\n\nThe second book is largely devoted to the [[Faith in Christianity|respective roles of faith and philosophical argument]]. Clement contends that while both are important, the [[Fear of God (religion)|fear of God]] is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom.<ref>Osborn (1994), p. 3</ref> To Clement, [[scripture]] is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos.<ref>Osborn (1994), p. 4</ref> Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 121</ref><ref>Osborn (1994), p. 7</ref> It is never irrational, as it is founded on the knowledge of the truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.<ref>Osborn (1994), pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nThe third book covers [[asceticism]]. He discusses marriage, which is treated similarly in the ''Paedagogus''. Clement rejects the Gnostic opposition to marriage, arguing that only men who are uninterested in women should remain celibate, and that sex is a positive good if performed within marriage for the purposes of procreation.<ref>Heid (2000), p. 65</ref> However it has not always been so: the Fall occurred because Adam and Eve succumbed to their desire for each other, and copulated before the allotted time.<ref>Seymour (1997), p. 257</ref> He argues against the idea that Christians should reject their family for an ascetic life, which stems from [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|14:25\u201327|KJV}}, contending that Jesus would not have contradicted the precept to \"Honour thy Father and thy Mother\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:12|KJV}}), one of the [[Ten Commandments]].<ref>Clark (1999), p. 198</ref> Clement concludes that asceticism will only be rewarded if the motivation is Christian in nature, and thus the asceticism of non-Christians such as the [[gymnosophists]] is pointless.<ref>Clark (1999), p. 17</ref><ref>Burrus (2011), p. 30</ref>\n\nClement begins the fourth book with a belated explanation of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives a brief description of his aims for the remaining three or four books.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 133</ref> The fourth book focuses on [[martyrdom]]. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing that they do not have sufficient respect for God's gift of life.<ref>Verhey (2011), p. 350</ref> He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives.<ref>Burrus (2011), p. 82</ref> [[Marcionism|Marcionites]] cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father \u2013 their sufferings are in vain.<ref>Osborn (1994), p. 8</ref> There is then a digression to the subject of theological [[epistemology]]. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the [[existence of God|existence of God the Father]], because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 139</ref>\n\nThe fifth book returns to the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and goodness can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable.<ref>Osborn (1994), p. 9</ref> He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected.<ref name=Osb199410>Osborn (1994), p. 10</ref> This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the [[materialist]] cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.<ref name=Osb199410/>\n\nIn the beginning of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the [[Prophets of Christianity|prophetic books of the Bible]]. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from ''On Plagiarism'', an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades.<ref>de J\u00e1uregui (2010), p. 201</ref> Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and [[Hell in Christianity|hell]], arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly [[Universalism in religion|universalist]] doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.<ref>Seymour (1997), pp. 262\u20133</ref>\n\nThe final extant book begins with a description of the nature of Christ, and that of the true Christian, who aims to be as similar as possible to both the Father and the Son. Clement then criticizes the simplistic [[anthropomorphism]] of most ancient religions, quoting [[Xenophanes]]' famous description of African, Thracian and Egyptian deities.<ref>Grant (1988), p. 77</ref> The Greek gods may also have had their origins in the personification of material objects: [[Ares]] representing iron, and Dionysus wine.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 150</ref> Prayer, and the relationship between love and knowledge are then discussed. {{BibleVerse|1|Corinthians|13:8|KJV}} seems to contradict the characterization of the true Christian as one who knows; but to Clement knowledge vanishes only in that it is subsumed by the universal love expressed by the Christian in his reverence for his Creator.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 151</ref> Following [[Socrates]], he argues that vice arises from a state of ignorance, not from intention. The Christian is a \"laborer in God's vineyard\", responsible both for his own path to salvation and that of his neighbor. The work ends with an extended passage against the contemporary divisions and heresies within the church.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 152</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nBesides the great trilogy, Clement's only other extant work is the treatise ''Salvation for the Rich'', also known as ''Who is the Rich Man who is Saved?'' Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of {{BibleVerse||Mark|10:25|KJV}}.<ref name=Fer1974166>Ferguson (1974), p. 166</ref> The rich are either unconvinced by the promise of eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel.<ref name=Fer1974166/> Jesus' words are not to be taken literally \u2014 we should seek the supercelestial [\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 167</ref> The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, as long as it is used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the [[Great Commandment|two commandments]], and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.<ref>Ferguson (1974), pp. 173, 178</ref>\n\nOther known works exist in fragments alone, including the four eschatological works in the secret tradition: ''Hypotyposes'', ''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', ''Eclogae Propheticae'' and the ''Adumbraetiones''.<ref>Bucar (2006), p. 252</ref> These cover Clement's celestial hierarchy, a complex schema in which the universe is headed by the Face of God, below which lie seven ''protoctists'', followed by [[archangel]]s, [[angel]]s and humans.<ref>Bucar (2006), p. 255</ref> According to [[Jean Dani\u00e9lou]], this schema is inherited from a Judaeo-Christian esotericism, followed by the Apostles, which was only imparted orally to those Christians who could be trusted with such mysteries.<ref>Dani\u00e9lou (1962), p. 262</ref> The ''proctocists'' are the first beings created by God, and act as priests to the archangels. Clement identifies them both as the \"Eyes of the Lord\" and with the [[Thrones]].<ref>Bucar (2006), p. 257</ref> Clement characterizes the celestial forms as entirely different from anything earthly, although he argues that members of each order only seem incorporeal to those of lower orders.<ref name=Buc2006260>Bucar (2006), p. 260</ref> According to the ''Eclogae Propheticae'', every thousand years every member of each order moves up a degree, and thus men can become angels. Even the ''protoctists'' can be elevated, although their new position in the hierarchy is not clearly defined.<ref name=Buc2006260/> The apparent contradiction between the fact that there can be only seven ''protoctists'' but also a vast number of archangels to be promoted to their order is problematical. The commonest modern explanation is that the number seven is not meant to be taken literally, but has a principally [[numerology|numerological]] significance.<ref>Bucar (2006), pp. 261\u20133</ref>\n\nWe know the titles of several lost works because of a list in Eusebius' ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', 6.13.1-3. They include the ''Outlines'', in eight books, and ''Against Judaizers''. Others are known only from mentions in Clement's own writings, including ''On Marriage'' and ''On Prophecy'', although few are attested by other writers and it is difficult to separate works which he intended to write from those which were actually completed.<ref>Ferguson (1974), p. 179</ref>\n\nThe [[Mar Saba letter]] was attributed to Clement by [[Morton Smith]], but there remains much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient [[pseudepigraph]] or a modern forgery.<ref>Heine (2010), pp. 117-8, 121</ref><ref>Osborn (2008), p. 195</ref> If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.<ref>Heine (2010), p. 121.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Eusebius]] is the first writer to provide an account of Clement's life and works, in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', 5.11.1-5, 6.6.1<ref>Of the two sections dedicated to Clement, ''Eccl. Hist''. 6.6.1 seems decidedly out of place, and [[Henri Valois|Valesius]] argued that this was evidence that Eusebius never revised his work; see McGiffert (1890), p. 253.</ref>  Eusebius provides a list of Clement's works, biographical information, and an extended quotation from the ''Stromata''.\n\n[[Photios I of Constantinople]] writes against Clement's theology in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'', although he is appreciative of Clement's learning and the literary merits of his work.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), p. 16</ref> In particular, he is highly critical of the ''Hypotyposes'', a work of biblical exegesis of which only a few fragments have survived. Photios compared Clement's treatise, which, like his other works, was highly syncretic, featuring ideas of Hellenistic, Jewish and Gnostic origin, unfavorably against the prevailing orthodoxy of the 9th century.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), pp. 17\u20138</ref> Amongst the particular ideas Photios deemed [[heresy|heretical]] were:\n*His belief that matter and thought are eternal, and thus did not originate from God, contradicting the doctrine of ''[[Creatio ex nihilo]]''.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), p. 23</ref>\n*His belief in [[esoteric cosmology|cosmic cycles]] predating the creation of the world, following [[Heraclitus]], which is extra-Biblical in origin.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), pp. 40\u201343</ref>\n*His belief that Christ, as Logos, was in some sense created, contrary to [[John 1]] but following [[Philo]].<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), p. 75</ref>\n*His ambivalence towards [[docetism]], the heretical doctrine that Christ's earthly body was an illusion.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), p. 95</ref>\n*His belief that [[Eve]] was created from Adam's sperm after he [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] during the night.<ref>Itter (2009), p. 68</ref>\n*His belief that {{BibleVerse||Genesis|6:2|KJV}} implies that angels indulged in [[coitus]] with human women. In Roman Catholic theology, angels are considered sexless.<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2010), p. 146</ref>\n\nDown to the seventeenth century he was venerated as a saint in Catholicism. His name was to be found in the martyrologies, and his feast fell on the fourth of December. But when the [[Roman Martyrology]] was revised by Pope [[Clement VIII]] his name was dropped from the [[General Roman Calendar|calendar]] on the advice of Cardinal [[Baronius]]. [[Benedict XIV]] maintained this decision of his predecessor on the grounds that Clement's life was little known, that he had never obtained public [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] in the Church, and that some of his doctrines were, if not erroneous, at least suspect.<ref>Havey (1908)</ref> Thus Clement is not revered as a saint in contemporary Roman Catholicism, nor is he considered a saint in much of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Clement's veneration is somewhat limited; he is commemorated nonetheless in [[Anglicanism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104172841/http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}</ref>  As well, the [[Universal Catholic Church]]'s cathedral in [[Dallas]] is dedicated to him.\n\nAs one of the earliest of the Church fathers whose works have survived, he is the subject of a significant amount of recent academic work, focusing on among other things, his exegesis of scripture, his Logos-theology and pneumatology, the relationship between his thought and non-Christian philosophy and his influence on [[Origen]].<ref>Ashwin-Siejkowski (2015), pp. 92-3</ref>\n\n==Works==\n===Editions===\n{{refbegin}}\n*[[Friedrich Sylburg|Sylburg, Friedrich]] (ed.)

(See [[Cogito ergo sum#Other forms|Other forms]].)}}{{efn|In the posthumously published work cited in the first footnote above, Descartes wrote \u201c'''''dubito, ergo sum''''', vel, quod idem est, '''''cogito, ergo sum'''''\" (\"'''''I doubt, therefore I am''''' \u2014 or what is the same \u2014 '''''I think, therefore I am'''''\").

''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nThis proposition became a fundamental element of [[Western philosophy]], as it purported to form a secure [[epistemology|foundation for knowledge]] in the face of [[radical doubt]]. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served\u2014at minimum\u2014as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a [[Consciousness|thinking entity]]\u2014in this case the [[self]]\u2014for there to be a thought.\n\n==In Descartes's writings==\nDescartes first wrote the phrase in French in his 1637 ''[[Discourse on the Method]]''. He referred to it in Latin without explicitly stating the familiar form of the phrase in his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. The earliest written record of the phrase in Latin is in his 1644 ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', where, in a margin note (see below), he provides a clear explanation of his intent: \"[W]e cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt\". Fuller forms of the phrase are attributable to other authors.\n\n===''Discourse on the Method''===\nThe phrase first appeared (in French) in Descartes's 1637 ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' in the first paragraph of its fourth part:\n\n{{quote|(French:) {{lang|fr|Ainsi, \u00e0 cause que nos sens nous trompent quelquefois, je voulus supposer qu'il n'y avoit aucune chose qui f\u00fbt telle qu'ils nous la font imaginer; Et parce qu'il y a des hommes qui se m\u00e9prennent en raisonnant, m\u00eame touchant les plus simples mati\u00e8res de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, et y font des Paralogismes, jugeant que j'\u00e9tois sujet \u00e0 faillir autant qu'aucun autre, je rejetai comme fausses toutes les raisons que j'avois prises auparavant pour D\u00e9monstrations; Et enfin, consid\u00e9rant que toutes les m\u00eames pens\u00e9es que nous avons \u00e9tant \u00e9veill\u00e9s nous peuvent aussi venir quand nous dormons, sans qu'il y en ait aucune pour lors qui soit vraie, je me r\u00e9solus de feindre que toutes les choses qui m'\u00e9toient jamais entr\u00e9es en l'esprit n'\u00e9toient non plus vraies que les illusions de mes songes.

But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be something; And as I observed that this truth, '''''{{nowrap|I think,}} {{nowrap|therefore I am}}''''',{{efn|name=\"formatting\"}} was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the Sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the [[first principle]] of the philosophy of which I was in search.{{efn|This translation, by Veitch in 1850,<ref name=\"Veitch1850\">{{cite book | author=[[John Veitch (poet)|Veitch, John]] | title=Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences, by Descartes | publisher=Sutherland and Knox | year=1850 | location=Edinburgh | page=74-5 | url = https://archive.org/stream/Descartes1637DiscourseOnTheMethodTrVeitch1850/Descartes%201637%20Discourse%20tr%20Veitch%201850#page/n77/mode/2up/search/Therefore+I+am}}</ref> is modified here as follows: Veitch's \"I think, hence I am\u201d is changed to the form by which it is currently best known in English, \"I think, therefore I am\", which appeared in the Haldane and Ross 1911 translation,<ref name=Haldane1911/> and as an isolated attributed phrase previously, e.g., in Sullivan (1794);<ref name=Sullivan1794>{{cite book | author=[[Richard Joseph Sullivan]] | title=A View of Nature, in Letters to a Traveller among the Alps, with Reflections on Atheistical Philosophy now exemplified in France | year = 1794 | page=129 | url=\nhttps://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1q00AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA129 | publisher=printed for T.

In the ''Meditations'', Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as \"that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.\" (''Meditation'' II)\n\nAt the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt\u2014his argument from the existence of a deceiving god\u2014Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists.  Even if there were a deceiving god (or an [[evil demon]]), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for there is no way one could be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived.\n\n<blockquote>But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies.  Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me.  In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something.  So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16\u201317{{efn|name= \"abbreviations\"}})</blockquote>\n\nThere are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of ''his own'' existence from the first-person point of view \u2014 he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that ''if he thinks'', then necessarily he exists (see the [[instantiation principle]]). Third, this proposition \"I am, I exist\" is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition. Descartes does not use this first certainty, the ''cogito'', as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to discover further truths<ref>''Self, Reason, and Freedom: A New Light on Descartes' Metaphysics'' Andrea Christofidou; chapter 2</ref>  As he puts it:\n\n<blockquote>Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16){{efn|name= \"abbreviations\"}}</blockquote>\n\nAccording to many Descartes specialists, including [[\u00c9tienne Gilson]], the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion \u2014 the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions \u2014 to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes's thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the ''cogito'' \u2014 a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see \u2014 but on using the ''cogito'' as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence.\n[[Baruch Spinoza]] in \"''[[Principia philosophiae cartesianae]]''\" at its ''Prolegomenon'' identified \"cogito ergo sum\" the \"''ego sum cogitans''\" (I am a thinking being) as the thinking [[substance theory|substance]] with his [[ontology|ontological]] interpretation. It can also be considered that ''Cogito ergo sum'' is needed before any living being can go further in life\".<ref>{{cite book | first =Nicholas | last =Vesey | title = Developing Consciousness| publisher = O-Books | location = United Kingdom | year = 2011| isbn = 978-1-84694-461-1 | page = 16}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=The Vesey citation does not include this material; a proper source is needed.|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Predecessors==\nAlthough the idea expressed in ''cogito, ergo sum'' is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. [[Plato]] spoke about the \"knowledge of knowledge\" (Greek \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 ''n\u00f3esis no\u00e9seos'') and [[Aristotle]] explains the idea in full length:\n<blockquote>But if life itself is good and pleasant (...) and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', 1170a25 ff.)</blockquote>\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] in ''[[City of God (book)|De Civitate Dei]]'' writes ''Si [\u2026] fallor, sum'' (\"If I am mistaken, I am\") (book XI, 26), and also anticipates modern refutations of the concept.  Furthermore, in the ''[[Enchiridion of Augustine|Enchiridion]]'' Augustine attempts to refute [[skepticism]] by stating, \"[B]y not positively affirming that they are alive, the skeptics ward off the appearance of error in themselves, yet they do make errors simply by showing themselves alive; one cannot err who is not alive. That we live is therefore not only true, but it is altogether certain as well\" (Chapter 7 section 20). Another predecessor was [[Avicenna]]'s \"[[Floating man|Floating Man]]\" [[thought experiment]] on human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]].<ref name=Leaman>[[Hossein Nasr|Nasr, Seyyed Hossein]] and [[Oliver Leaman|Leaman, Oliver]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', Routledge, p. 315, {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe 8th century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] wrote in a similar fashion, No one thinks, 'I am not', arguing that one's existence cannot be doubted, as there must be someone there to doubt.<ref name=Radhakrishnan.S>Radhakrishnan, S. (1948), ''Indian Philosophy, vol II'', p. 476, [[George Allen & Unwin Ltd]],</ref> . The central idea of ''cogito, ergo sum'' is also the topic of [[Mandukya Upanishad]]. \n\nSpanish philosopher [[G\u00f3mez Pereira]] in his 1554 work ''De Inmortalitate Animae'', published in 1749, wrote \"''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''\" (\"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\").<ref>G\u00f3mez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': \"De Immortalitate Animae\", 1749 [1554], p. 277.</ref><ref>Santos L\u00f3pez, Modesto (1986). \"G\u00f3mez Pereira, m\u00e9dico y fil\u00f3sofo medinense\". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansi\u00f3n'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.</ref>\n\n==Critique==\n===Use of \"I\"===\nIn ''Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry'', [[Bernard Williams]] provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. Apparently, the first scholar who raised the \"I\" problem was [[Pierre Gassendi]]. He \"points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation that there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking to a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to prove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the capacity for thought\". In other words, \"the only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/|title=Pierre Gassendi|author=Fisher, Saul|date=2005|accessdate=1 December 2014}} from [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref> The objection, as presented by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Georg Lichtenberg]], is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: \"thinking is occurring.\" That is, whatever the force of the ''cogito'', Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the \"I,\" is more than the ''cogito'' can justify. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an \"I\", that there is such an activity as \"thinking\", and that \"I\" know what \"thinking\" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be \"it thinks\" wherein the \"it\" could be an impersonal subject as in the sentence \"It is raining.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aporia.byu.edu/pdfs/monte-Sum_ergo_cogito.pdf|title=Sum, Ergo Cogito: Nietzsche Re-orders Decartes|last=Monte|first=Jonas|date=2015|website=Aporia.byu.edu|publisher=BYU|access-date=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Kierkegaard's critique===\nThe Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] calls the phrase a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] in his ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''.<ref>Kierkegaard, S\u00f8ren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 38-42.</ref> He argues that the ''cogito'' already presupposes the existence of \"I\", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise \"I think\" into the premises \"'x' thinks\" and \"I am that 'x'\", where \"x\" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the \"I\" from the thinking thing.<ref>Sch\u00f6nbaumsfeld, Genia. ''A Confusion of the Spheres''. Oxford, 2007. p.168-170.</ref>\n\nHere, the ''cogito'' has already assumed the \"I\"'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely \"developing the content of a concept\", namely that the \"I\", which already exists, thinks.<ref>Kierkegaard, S\u00f8ren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 40.</ref> As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.<ref>Archie, Lee C., \"S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''God's Existence Cannot Be Proved''\". Philosophy of Religion. Lander Philosophy, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Williams' critique===\nBernard Williams claims that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say \"I am thinking,\" is something conceivable from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perspective; namely objective \"thought-events\" in the former case, and an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of \"there is thinking\" without relativizing it to ''something.''  However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through [[introspection]], or our experience of [[consciousness]], we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Heidegger's critique===\nAs a critic of Cartesian subjectivity, Heidegger sought to ground human subjectivity in death as that certainty which individualizes and authenticates our being. As he wrote in 1927:\n\n\"This certainty, that \"I myself am in that I will die,\" is the basic certainty of Dasein itself. It is a genuine statement of Dasein, while ''cogito sum'' is only the semblance of such a statement. If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be ''sum moribundus'' [I am in dying], ''moribundus'' not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am ''moribundus''. The ''MORIBUNDUS'' first gives the ''SUM'' its sense.\"\n\n===John Macmurray's critique===\nThe Scottish philosopher [[John Macmurray]] rejects the ''cogito'' outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitles the Form of the Personal. \"We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality.\" <ref>Macmurray, John. ''The Self as Agent''. Humanity books, 1991. p. 78.</ref> The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the [[:wikt:unity|unity]] of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves, and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate ''cogito'', Macmurray proposes the substitution of \"I do\" for \"I think\",  ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Floating man]]\n* [[List of Latin phrases (full)|List of Latin phrases]]\n* [[Solipsism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist | refs=\n{{efn|name = \"capitalization and punctuation\"|Descartes wrote this phrase only once, in a posthumously published lesser-known work.<ref name=\"AT\">{{Cite | editor-last1 = Adam | editor-first1 = Charles | editor-last2 = Tannery | editor-first2 = Paul | author-link = Ren\u00e9 Descartes | contribution = ''La Recherche de la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 par La Lumiere Naturale'' | title = ''Oeuvres de Descartes'' | volume = X | year = 1901 | page = 535 | contribution-url = https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Descartes_-_\u0152uvres,_\u00e9d._Adam_et_Tannery,_X.djvu/535}}</ref> \n\nIt appeared there mid-sentence, uncapitalized, and with a comma.

He is best known for his comics about [[Donald Duck]] and as the creator of [[Scrooge McDuck]]. He worked anonymously until late in his career; fans dubbed him '''The Duck Man''' and '''The Good Duck Artist'''. In 1987, Barks was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]].\n\nBarks worked for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Studio]] and [[Western Publishing]] where he created [[Duckburg]] and many of its inhabitants, such as [[Scrooge McDuck]] (1947), [[Gladstone Gander]] (1948), the [[Beagle Boys]] (1951), [[The Junior Woodchucks]] (1951), [[Gyro Gearloose]] (1952), [[Duck family (Disney)#Cornelius Coot|Cornelius Coot]] (1952), [[Flintheart Glomgold]] (1956), [[John D. Rockerduck]] (1961) and [[Magica De Spell]] (1961). [[Will Eisner]] called him \"the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] of comic books.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fantagraphics.com/images/stories/books/wddd01/donald-blad.pdf |title=A Timeless Classic For All Ages - Fantagraphics Books|year=2011|publisher=Fantagraphics|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBarks was born in [[Merrill, Oregon|Merrill]], [[Oregon]], to William Barks and his wife Arminta Johnson. He had an older brother named Clyde. His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum. His maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife Suzanna Massey, but little else is known about his ancestors. Barks was the descendant of Jacob Barks who came to Missouri from North Carolina around 1800. They lived in Marble Hill in Bollinger County. Jacob Barks' son Isaac was the father of the David Barks noted above.<ref>Source: 1850 census; ''Goodspeed's History of Southeast Missouri'', Southern Historical Press, 1888.</ref>\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Barks' description of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child. His parents owned one square mile (2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land that served as their farm. The nearest neighbor lived half a mile (800 m) away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks' parents than a friend. The closest school was about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} away and Barks had to walk that distance every day. The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him. He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school. \"Schools were good in those days,\" he used to say.\nThe lessons lasted from nine o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.\n\nIn 1908, William Barks (in an attempt to increase the family income) moved with his family to [[Midland, Oregon|Midland]], Oregon, some miles north of Merrill, to be closer to the new railway lines. He established a new stock-breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses.\n\nNine-year-old Clyde and seven-year-old Carl worked long hours there. But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland's market place made a strong impression on him. This was expected, as he was not used to crowds up until then. According to Barks, his attention was mostly drawn to the [[cowboy]]s that frequented the market with their revolvers, strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor.\n\nBy 1911, they had been successful enough to move to [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[California]]. There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards. Unfortunately, the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties. William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown.\n\nAs soon as William recovered, he made the decision to move back to Merrill. The year was 1913, and Barks was already 12 years old; but, due to the constant moving, he had not yet managed to complete grade school. He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916.\n\n1916 served as a turning point in Barks' life for various reasons. First, Arminta, his mother, died in this year. Second, his hearing problems, which had already appeared earlier, had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking. His hearing would continue to get worse later, but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid. Later in life, he couldn't do without one. Third, the closest high school to their farm was {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} away and even if he did enroll in it, his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems. He had to decide to stop his school education, much to his disappointment.\n\n===From job to job===\nBarks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, stubborn and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At the same time he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]] and his own [[Scrooge McDuck]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nDonald's drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks' own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nScrooge's main difference to Donald, according to Barks, was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence, determination and hard work, he was able to overcome them. Or, as Scrooge himself would say to [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]]: by being \"tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.\" In Barks's stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems, even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end. In addition, Scrooge was quite similar to his creator in appearing often to be as melancholic, introspective and secretive as he was.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThrough both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor. It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Professional artist===\nAt the same time Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite [[comic strip]] artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.\n\nAmong his early favorites were [[Winsor McCay]] (mostly known for ''[[Little Nemo]]'') and [[Frederick Burr Opper]] (mostly known for ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'') but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention.\n\nAt 16 he was mostly self-taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence. He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time. But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style.\n\nBy December 1918, he left his father's home to attempt to find a job in [[San Francisco]], California. He worked for a while in a small publishing house while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success.\n\n===First and second marriages===\nWhile he continued drifting through various jobs, he met Pearl Turner (1904\u20131987). In 1921 they married and had two daughters:\n* Peggy Barks (1923\u20131963)\n* Dorothy Barks (1924\u20132014)\n\nIn 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer, but that ended soon. He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings. He soon managed to sell some of them to ''Judge'' magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based ''Calgary Eye-Opener'', a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era. He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines. His salary of 90 dollars a month was considered respectable enough for the time. A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period, ''Coo Coo'' #1, was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997.\n\nMeanwhile, he had his first divorce. He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930. After he moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], where ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'' had its offices he met Clara Balken who in 1938 became his second wife.\n\n===Disney===\nIn November 1935, when he learned that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his studio, Barks decided to apply. He was approved for a try-out which entailed a move to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired. His starting salary was 20 dollars a week. He started at Disney Studios in 1935, more than a year after the debut of Donald Duck on June 9, 1934, in the short animated film ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]''.\n\nBarks initially worked as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]]. This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of ''[[Modern Inventions]]'', for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.\n\nIn 1937 when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co-starring with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] as previously, a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series. Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons by 1937 Barks was (principally with partner [[Jack Hannah]]) originating story ideas that were storyboarded and (if approved by Walt) put into production. He collaborated on such cartoons as ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'' (1938), ''[[Donald's Cousin Gus]]'' (1939), ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940),''[[Timber (film)|Timber]]'' (1941), ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Plastics Inventor]]'' (1944).\n\n===The Good Duck Artist===\n[[File:Interior page from Walt Disney's Comics and Stories.jpg|thumb|Omelet opening page]]\nUnhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney, and bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio's air conditioning, Barks quit in 1942. Shortly before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist, contributing half the artwork for a one-shot [[comic book]] (the other half of the art being done by story partner [[Jack Hannah]]) titled ''[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]''. This 64-page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer [[Bob Karp]] from an unproduced feature, and published in October 1942 in [[Dell Comics]] ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #9. It was the first Donald Duck story originally produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition, in this case for the treasure of [[Henry Morgan]]. Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories. This actually was not his first work in comics, as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted ''[[Pluto Saves the Ship]]'', which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States.\n\nAfter quitting the Disney Studio, Barks relocated to the [[Hemet, California|Hemet]]/[[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] area in the semi-desert [[Inland Empire]] region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm.\n\nWhen asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten-pager in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #146 (Nov. 1952) in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was renamed Omelet. Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business.\n\nBut to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether [[Western Publishing]], which had published ''Pirate Gold'', had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories. He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''. At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories.\n\n''[[The Victory Garden (comics)|The Victory Garden]]'', that initial ten-page story published in April, 1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades, well into his purported retirement. These can be mostly divided into three categories:\n* One-page gag stories like \"[[Coffee for Two]]\" and \"[[Sorry to be Safe]]\". These one-pagers were usually printed in black and white (or black and white and red) on the inside front, inside back, and outside back covers. These stories focused on one joke. \n* Ten-pagers, comedic Donald Duck stories that were the lead for the monthly flagship title ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'', whose circulation peaked in the mid-1950s at 3 million copies sold a month.\n* Humorous adventure stories, usually 24-32 pages in length. In the 1940s these were one-shots in the ''Four Color'' series (issued 4\u20136 times a year) that starred Donald and his nephews. Starting in the early 1950s (and through his retirement) Barks' longer stories were almost exclusively published in Uncle Scrooge's own quarterly title.\n\nBarks' artistic growth during his first decade in comics saw a transformation from rather rudimentary storytelling derived from his years as an animation artist and storyman into a virtuoso creator of complex narratives, notably in his longer adventure tales. According to critic Geoffrey Blum, the process that saw its beginnings in 1942's Pirate Gold first bore its full fruit in 1950's '[[Vacation Time]],' which he describes as 'a visual primer for reading comics and understanding ... the form ...\"<ref name=\"Barks and the Bending Panel\">{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Geoffrey|title=Barks and the Bending Panel|journal=The Carl Barks Library of Donald Duck Adventures in Color|year=c. 1990|issue=18|pages=[46]}}</ref>\n\nHe surrounded [[Donald Duck]] and nephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters, such as the aforementioned [[Scrooge McDuck]], the wealthiest [[duck]] in the world; [[Gladstone Gander]], Donald's obscenely lucky cousin; inventor [[Gyro Gearloose]]; the persistent [[Beagle Boys]]; the sorceress [[Magica De Spell]]; Scrooge's rivals [[Flintheart Glomgold]] and [[John D. Rockerduck]]; Daisy's nieces [[April, May and June]]; Donald's neighbor Jones, and [[The Junior Woodchucks]] organization.\n\nBarks's stories (whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a [[Greek chorus]] commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]''.\n\n===Third marriage===\nAs Barks blossomed creatively, his marriage to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 \u2013 March 10, 1993), nicknamed Gar\u00e9. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are in the collection of the [[Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art]]. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story \"Christmas in Duckburg\", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney's Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.\n\n===No longer anonymous===\nPeople who worked for Disney (and its comic book licensees) generally did so in relative anonymity; stories would only carry Walt Disney's name and (sometimes) a short identification number. Prior to 1960 Barks' identity remained a mystery to his readers. However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style\u2014he \"signed\" many stories with a small image of a barking dog\u2014and began to call him the Good Duck Artist, a label that stuck even after his true identity was discovered by fans in the late 1950s. Malcolm Willits was the first person to learn Barks's name and address, but two brothers named John and [[Bill Spicer]] became the first fans to contact Barks after independently discovering the same information. After Barks received a 1960 visit from the Spicer brothers and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as word of his identity spread through the emerging network of comic book fandom [[fanzine]]s and [[comic book convention|conventions]].<ref name=\"SpicerLetter\">[http://www.cbarks.dk/thefanletter.htm Spicer, John. Letter, April 11, 1960.]</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Carl Barks signing autographs in Finland in 1994.jpg|Carl Barks visiting [[Finland]] in June 1994.|thumb]]\nCarl Barks retired in 1966, but was persuaded by editor [[Chase Craig]] to continue to script stories for Western. The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a [[Daisy Duck]] tale (\"The Dainty Daredevil\") published in ''[[Walt Disney Comics Digest]]'' issue 5 (Nov. 1968). When bibliographer [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] asked Barks why he drew it, Barks' vague recollection was no one was available and he was asked to do it as a favor by Craig.\n\nHe wrote one Uncle Scrooge story, three Donald Duck stories and from 1970\u20131974 was the main writer for the [[Junior Woodchucks]] comic book (issues 6 through 25). The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957 [\"Land of the Pygmy Indians\", ''Uncle Scrooge'' #18]. Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers. For a time the Barkses lived in [[Goleta, California]], before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to [[Temecula, California|Temecula]].\n\nTo make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows where he and Gar\u00e9 exhibited. Subjects included humorous depictions of life on the farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendered paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks (\"A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By\", taken from the cover of ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact [[George Sherman (comics)|George Sherman]] at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney.<ref>[http://www.cbarks.dk/thecorrespondence1970s.htm TheCorrespondence1970s.com]</ref> When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.\n\n{{quote box |title=Ode to the Disney Ducks |source= \u2014Carl Barks, 1999{{sfn|Blum|2008|page=293}} |width=270px |fontsize=80% |bgcolor=#eeffff\n|quote=<poem>They ride tall ships to the far away,\nand see the long ago.\nThey walk where fabled people trod,\nand Yetis trod the snow.\n\nThey meet the folks who live on stars,\nand find them much like us,\nWith food and love and happiness\nthe things they most discuss.\n\nThe world is full of clans and cults\nabuzz as angry bees,\nAnd Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers\nat Littlest Chickadees.\n\nThe ducks show us that part of life\nis to forgive a slight.\nThat black eyes given in revenge\nkeep hatred burning bright.\n\nSo when our walks in sun or shade\npass graveyards filled by wars,\nIt's nice to stop and read of ducks\nwhose battles leave no scars.\n\nTo read of ducks who parody\nour vain attempts at glory,\nThey don't exist, but somehow leave\nus glad we bought their story.</poem>\n}}\n\nWhen Barks expressed dismay at coping with the backlog of orders he faced, fan/dealers Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran suggested Barks instead auction his paintings at conventions and via Cochran's catalog ''Graphic Gallery''. By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions.\n\nAt Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention (\"She Was Spangled and Flashy\") sold for $2,500. Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized.\n\nIn 1976, Barks and Gar\u00e9 went to Boston for the NewCon show, their first comic convention appearance. Among the other attendees was famed [[Little Lulu]] comic book scripter [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]]; despite both having worked for [[Western Publishing]] this was the first time they met. The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done, \"July Fourth in Duckburg\", which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors. It sold for a then record high amount: $6,400.\n\nSoon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the Scrooge McDuck paintings, leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings. To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non-Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes. These were eventually collected in the limited-edition book ''Animal Quackers''.\n\nAs the result of heroic efforts by ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' producer [[Gary Kurtz]] and screenwriter [[Edward Summer]], Disney relented and in 1981, allowed Barks to do a now seminal oil painting called \"Wanderers of Wonderlands\" for a breakthrough limited edition book entitled ''Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times''. The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist [[Peter Ledger]] along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations, \"Go Slowly, Sands of Time\". After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City, Kurtz and Summer published the book through [[Celestial Arts]], which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose. The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories. It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in ''[[Time Magazine]] ''and subsequently in ''[[Newsweek]]'', and the first book review in ''Time Magazine'' with large color illustrations.\n\nIn 1977 and 1982, Barks attended the San Diego Comic Con. As with his appearance in Boston, the response to his presence was overwhelming, with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph.\n\nIn 1981, Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran, two long-time Disney comics fans, decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks. Their first efforts went into establishing [[Another Rainbow]] Publishing, the banner under which they produced and issued the award-winning book, \"The Fine Art of Walt Disney\u00b4s Donald Duck by Carl Barks\", a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly limited editions, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series.\n\nIn 1983, Barks relocated one last time to [[Grants Pass, Oregon]],{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=xliv}} near where he grew up, partly at the urging of friend and ''[[Broom Hilda]]'' artist [[Russell Myers]], who lived in the area. The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans. In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass.\n\nIn 1983, Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book oeuvre of Barks\u2014over 500 stories in all\u2014in the ten-set, thirty-volume ''[[Carl Barks Library]]''. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks\u00b4 pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible to the way he would originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.\n\nIn 1985, a new division was founded, [[Gladstone Publishing]], which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone introduced a whole new generation of Disney comic book readers to the wondrous storytelling of such luminaries as Barks, Paul Murry, and Floyd Gottfredson, as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics masters Don Rosa and William Van Horn. Seven years after Gladstone's founding, the ''Carl Barks Library'' was revived as the ''Carl Barks Library in Color'', a full-color, high-quality squarebound comic albums (including the first-ever Carl Barks trading cards).\n\nFrom 1993 to 1998, Barks' career was managed by the \"Carl Barks Studio\" (Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby\u2014They had sold Barks original art since 1979). This involved numerous art projects and activities, including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994, Iceland being the first foreign country he ever visited. Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993. Silk screen prints of paintings along with high-end art objects (such as original water colors, bronze figurines and ceramic tiles) were produced based on designs by Barks.\n\nDuring the summer of 1994 and until his death, Carl Barks & his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt, a museum exhibition producer from [[Mannheim]], Germany, as his agent for Europe. Publisher \"Edition 313\" put out numerous lithographs. In 1997, tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio. Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance. He was represented by Rev. Ed Bergen, as he completed a final project. Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years.\n\nDuring his Carl Barks Studio years, Barks created two more stories: the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story \"Horsing Around with History\", which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art. The outlines for Barks' final Donald Duck story \"Somewhere in Nowhere\", were first published in 1997, in Italy, with art by Pat Block.\n\nAustrian artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] curated and organized the first solo museum-exhibition of Carl Barks. Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400,000 visitors.<ref>[http://www.helnwein.de/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_449.html Gottfried Helnwein \"Wer ist Carl Barks?\"]</ref>\n\nAt the same time in spring 1994, Reichelt and Ina Brockmann designed a special museum exhibition tour about Barks' life and work. Also represented for the first time at this exhibition were Disney artists [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]]. Since 1995, more than 500,000 visitors have attended the shows in Europe.\n\nReichelt also translated Michael Barrier's biography of Barks into German and published it in 1994.\n\n===Final days and death===\nBarks spent his final years in a new home in [[Grants Pass, Oregon]], which he and Gar\u00e9, who died in 1993, had built next door to their original home. In July 1999, he was diagnosed with [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], a form of cancer arising from the [[white blood cell]]s in the [[bone marrow]], for which he received oral [[chemotherapy]]. However, as the disease progressed, causing him great discomfort, the ailing Barks decided to stop receiving treatment in June 2000.<ref>[http://www.cbarks.dk/thelastlettersb.htm Letter from caregiver Serene Hunicke (June 8, 2000)]. Carl Barks.dk. Retrieved on March 6, 2016.</ref> In spite of his terminal condition, Barks remained, according to caregiver Serene Hunicke, ''\"funny up to the end\"''.\n\nThe year before, Barks, an [[atheist]], had told the university professor [[Donald Ault]]:\n\n<blockquote>I have no apprehension, no fear of death. I do not believe in an afterlife. ... I think of death as total peace. You're beyond the clutches of all those who would crush you.{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=222}}</blockquote>\n\nOn August 25, 2000, shortly after midnight, Carl Barks died quietly in his sleep.{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=xlvi}} He was interred in Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery in Grants Pass, beside Gar\u00e9's grave.<ref>[http://www.cbarks.dk/thefarewellgravesite.htm The Gravesite]. Carl Barks.dk. Retrieved on March 6, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nBarks' Donald Duck stories were rated #7 on [[The Comics Journal#The Journal's Top 100 Comics list|''The Comics Journal'' list of 100 top comics]]; his Uncle Scrooge stories were rated #20.\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] have acknowledged that the rolling-boulder booby trap in the opening scene of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was inspired by the 1954 Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge adventure \"The Seven Cities of Cibola\" (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #7). Lucas and Spielberg have also said that some of Barks's stories about space travel and the depiction of aliens had an influence on them.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921233,00.html Lucas comments on the influence of Bark's style of story flow].</ref> Lucas wrote the foreword to the 1982 ''Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times''. In it he calls Barks's stories \"cinematic\" and \"a priceless part of our literary heritage\".\n\nThe [[Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD set ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Five#The Chronological Donald, Volume 2|Chronological Donald, Volume 2]]'' includes a salute to Barks.\n\nCarl Barks has an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[2730 Barks]].\n\nIn [[Almere]], [[Netherlands]], a street was named after him: Carl Barksweg. The same neighborhood also includes a Donald Ducklaan and a Goofystraat.\n\nJapanese animator and cartoonist [[Osamu Tezuka]], who created [[manga]] such as \"[[Astro Boy]]\" and \"[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]\", was a fan of Barks' work. ''New Treasure Island'', one of Tezuka's first works, was partly influenced by [[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]].<ref name=tcj.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/manga-finds-pirate-gold-the-case-of-new-treasure-island/ |title=Manga Finds Pirate Gold: The Case of ''New Treasure Island'' |last=Holmberg|first=Ryan|year=2012|publisher=The Comics Journal |accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA 1949 Donald Duck ten-pager features Donald raising a yacht from the ocean floor by filling it with [[ping pong]] balls.

Some sources claim Kr\u00f8yer was denied a Dutch patent registration (application number NL 6514306) for his invention on the grounds that the Barks story was a [[prior art|prior publication]] of the invention. However, no definite proof of this story is available.<ref>[http://www.iusmentis.com/patents/priorart/donaldduck/ The \"Donald Duck as prior art\" case (in Patents : When is something prior art @ iusmentis.com]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octrooicentrum.nl/actueel/nieuws/20060601-1.aspx |title=''Donald Duck verslaat uitvinder! donderdag'' 1 juni 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075256/http://www.octrooicentrum.nl/actueel/nieuws/20060601-1.aspx |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}.</ref> Kr\u00f8yer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.\n\nFor those currently drawing Disney Duck comics, the influence of Barks cannot be overstated. For artists such as [[Daan Jippes]] and [[Freddy Milton]], Barks' comics have made a great impact. [[Don Rosa]], one of the most popular living Disney artists, and possibly the one who has been most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology, considers (with few exceptions) all Barks' duck stories as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], and all others as [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]]. Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie-makers cite Carl Barks as their 'major influence and inspiration'.<ref name=bpib-Don>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpib.com/illustra2/barks2.htm |title=Don Rosa on Carl Barks' Conquest of Europe |last=Rosa |first=Don |year=2000 |publisher= |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Barks' work in Europe is high, and has been that way for years. When the news of Barks' passing was hardly covered by the press in America, \"in Europe the sad news was flashed instantly across the airwaves and every newspaper&nbsp;\u2014 they realized the world had lost one of the most beloved, influential and well-known creators in international culture.\"<ref name=bpib/>\n\nIn 2010 [[Oregon Cartoon Institute]] produced a video to educate the uninitiated about the influence of Carl Barks and [[Basil Wolverton]] on [[Robert Crumb]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gliCE-vDNc0 \"Carl Barks + Basil Wolverton = Genius R. Crumb\"]</ref>\n\nThe video game ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' is dedicated to the memory of Carl Barks.\n\nCarl Barks drew an early [[Andy Panda]] comic book story published in ''New Funnies'' #76, 1943. It is one of his few stories to feature humans interacting with [[funny animal]] characters (another is ''Dangerous Disguise'', [[Four Color]] #308, 1951<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++308-02 \"Dangerous Disguise\" at the INDUCKS]</ref>). See [[List of Fictional Pandas]].\n\nThe life story of Carl Barks, largely drawing upon his relationship with Disney and the phonetic similarity of his name to [[Karl Marx]], serves as a loose inspiration to one of the subplots in ''[[The Last Song of Manuel Sendero]]'' by [[Ariel Dorfman]], though his biography in this novel veers sharply into science fiction fantasy and symbolism.\n\nThe first image ever to be displayed on an [[Apple Macintosh]] was a scan of Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Scrooge_McDuck.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium&search=scrooge%20mcduck |title=Macintosh Stories : Scrooge McDuck by Andy Hertzfeld|accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Coo Coo'' #1, Hamilton Comics, 1997 (a facsimile of one of the racy magazines Barks did cartoons for in the thirties).\n* ''The Carl Barks' Big Book of Barney Bear'' ({{ISBN|978-1-60010-929-4}}), 2011 collection edited by [[Craig Yoe]] and published by [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] of the [[Barney Bear]] and Benny Burro stories that originally appeared in [[Our Gang#The MGM era|Our Gang Comics]] #11\u201336 (May/June 1944 \u2013 June 1947); Barks' one substantial non-Disney series.\n* ''[[Carl Barks Library]]'', 1984\u20131990, 30 hardback volumes in black and white published by [[Another Rainbow Publishing]].\n* ''Carl Barks Library'' (graphic album format, in color) 1992\u20131998\n* ''O Melhor da Disney: As Obras Completas de Carl Barks'' 2004\u20132008, 41 volume limited edition published by [[Editora Abril|Abril Jovem]] in Brazil, compiling all the stories written by Barks, with his oil paintings as the cover art.\n* ''[[The Carl Barks Collection]]'' 2005\u20132009, 30 volume limited edition published by [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, and by [[Sanoma]] in Finland.

All CGS [[mechanics|mechanical]] units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover [[electromagnetism]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/centimetre-gram-second-system|title=Centimetre-gram-second system {{!}} physics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=article is about viscosity, not electromagnetism}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=Units/CGS|title=The Centimeter-Gram-Second (CGS) System of Units - Maple Programming Help|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1506/1506.01951.pdf | title = Babel of units: The evolution of units systems in classical electromagnetism | access-date = 31 March 2018 | last = Carron | first = Neal J.| date = 21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe CGS system has been largely supplanted by the [[MKS system of units|MKS system]] based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]], and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the [[International System of Units]] (SI). In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent.\n\nIn measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, [[force]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the [[Unit conversion|unit-conversion factors]] are all [[Exponentiation#Powers of ten|powers of 10]] as {{nowrap|1=100 cm = 1 m}} and {{nowrap|1=1000 g = 1 kg}}. For example, the CGS unit of force is the [[dyne]] which is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 g\u22c5cm/s<sup>2</sup>}}, so the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]] ({{nowrap|1=1 kg\u22c5m/s<sup>2</sup>}}), is equal to 100,000 dynes.\n\nOn the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units of [[charge (physics)|charge]], electric and magnetic fields, [[voltage]], and so on), converting between CGS and SI is more subtle. Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on which system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit \"sub-systems\", including [[Gaussian units]], \"ESU\", \"EMU\", and [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and  \"CGS units\" often used   specifically refers to CGS-Gaussian units.\n\n==History==\nThe CGS system goes back to a proposal in 1832 by the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to base a system of absolute units on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time.<ref>{{citation | first = C.

For example, many everyday objects are hundreds or thousands of centimetres long, such as humans, rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide general use outside the field of science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally for scientific purposes by the MKS (metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second) system, which in turn developed into the modern [[SI]] standard.\n\nSince the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide, in the United States more slowly than elsewhere. CGS units are today no longer accepted by the house styles of most scientific journals, textbook publishers, or standards bodies, although they are commonly used in astronomical journals such as ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''. CGS units are still occasionally encountered in technical literature, especially in the United States in the fields of [[material science]], [[electrodynamics]] and [[astronomy]]. The continued usage of CGS units is most prevalent in magnetism and related fields because the B and H fields have the same units in free space and there is a lot of potential for confusion when converting published measurements from cgs to MKS.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=L.

However, where [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s are needed, the SI ones are generally used and taught instead of the CGS ones today. For example, a physics lab course might ask students to record lengths in centimetres, and masses in grams, but force (a derived unit) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, a usage consistent with the SI system.\n\n==Definition of CGS units in mechanics==\nIn mechanics, the CGS and SI systems of units are built in an identical way. The two systems differ only in the scale of two out of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), while the third unit (second as the unit of time) is the same in both systems.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI, and the laws of mechanics are not affected by the choice of units. The definitions of all [[derived unit]]s in terms of the three base units are therefore the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous one-to-one correspondence of derived units:\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{dx}{dt}</math>&nbsp; (definition of [[velocity]])\n:<math>F=m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}</math>&nbsp; ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]])\n:<math>E = \\int \\vec{F}\\cdot \\mathrm{d\\,}\\vec{x}</math>&nbsp; ([[energy]] defined in terms of [[Mechanical work|work]])\n:<math>p = \\frac{F}{L^2} </math>&nbsp; ([[pressure]] defined as force per unit area)\n:<math>\\eta = \\tau/\\frac{dv}{dx}</math>&nbsp; (dynamic [[viscosity]] defined as [[shear stress]] per unit velocity [[gradient]]).\n\nThus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, [[barye]], is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:\n\n:1&nbsp;unit of pressure = 1&nbsp;unit of force/(1&nbsp;unit of length)<sup>2</sup> = 1&nbsp;unit of mass/(1&nbsp;unit of length\u22c5(1&nbsp;unit of time)<sup>2</sup>)\n:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>)\n:1 Pa = 1&nbsp;kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>).\n\nExpressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:\n\n:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) = 10<sup>\u22123</sup> kg/(10<sup>\u22122 </sup>m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) = 10<sup>\u22121</sup> kg/(m\u22c5s<sup>2</sup>) = 10<sup>\u22121</sup> Pa.\n\n===Definitions and conversion factors of CGS units in mechanics===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: \n* In SI, the unit of [[electric current]], the ampere (A), was historically defined such that the [[magnetism|magnetic]] force exerted by two infinitely long, thin, parallel wires 1 [[metre]] apart and carrying a current of 1 [[ampere]] is exactly 2\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup> [[newton (unit)|N]]/[[metre|m]]. This definition results in all [[International System of Units#Derived units|SI electromagnetic units]] being consistent (subject to factors of some [[integer]] powers of 10) with the EMU CGS system described in further sections. The ampere is a base unit of the SI system, with the same status as the metre, kilogram, and second. Thus the relationship in the definition of the ampere with the metre and newton is disregarded, and the ampere is not treated as dimensionally equivalent to any combination of other base units. As a result, electromagnetic laws in SI require an additional constant of proportionality (see [[Vacuum permittivity]]) to relate electromagnetic units to kinematic units. (This constant of proportionality is derivable directly from the above definition of the ampere.) All other electric and magnetic units are derived from these four base units using the most basic common definitions: for example, [[charge (physics)|electric charge]] ''q'' is defined as current ''I'' multiplied by time ''t'',\n::<math>q=I\\cdot t</math>,\n:therefore the unit of electric charge, the [[coulomb]] (C), is defined as 1&nbsp;C = 1&nbsp;A\u22c5s.\n* The CGS system avoids introducing new base quantities and units, and instead ''derives'' all electric and magnetic units directly from the centimetre, gram, and second by specifying the form of the expression of physical laws that relate electromagnetic phenomena to mechanics.\n\n===Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism===\nElectromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its [[derivative|rate of change]] (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written<ref name=Jack>{{cite book \n| author=Jackson, John David \n| title=Classical Electrodynamics \n| edition=3rd \n| pages=775\u2013784\n| location=New York \n| publisher=Wiley \n| year=1999 \n| isbn=0-471-30932-X}}</ref> in system-independent form as follows:\n\n*The first is [[Coulomb's law]], <math>F = k_{\\rm C} \\frac{q \\cdot q^\\prime}{d^2}</math>, which describes the electrostatic force ''F'' between electric charges <math>q</math> and <math>q^\\prime</math>, separated by distance ''d''. Here <math>k_{\\rm C}</math> is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the base units.\n*The second is [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]], <math>\\frac{dF}{dL} = 2 k_{\\rm A}\\frac{I \\, I^\\prime}{d}</math>, which describes the magnetic force ''F'' per unit length ''L'' between currents ''I'' and ''I&prime;'' flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance ''d'' that is much greater than the wire diameters. Since <math>I=q/t\\,</math> and <math> I^\\prime=q^\\prime/t</math>, the constant <math>k_{\\rm A}</math> also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the base units.\n\n[[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants <math>k_{\\rm C}</math> and <math>k_{\\rm A}</math> must obey <math>k_{\\rm C} / k_{\\rm A} = c^2</math>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]]. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting <math>k_{\\rm C}=1</math> then Amp\u00e8re's force law will contain a prefactor <math>2/c^2</math>. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Amp\u00e8re's force law by setting <math> k_{\\rm A} = 1</math> or <math>k_{\\rm A} = 1/2</math>, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.\n\nIndeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:\n* The first law describes the [[Lorentz force]] produced by a magnetic field '''B''' on a charge '''q''' moving with velocity '''v''':\n:: <math> \\mathbf{F} =  \\alpha_{\\rm L} q\\;\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\;. </math>\n* The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field '''B''' by an electric current ''I'' of finite length d'''l''' at a point displaced by a vector '''r''', known as [[Biot\u2013Savart law]]:\n:: <math> d\\mathbf{B} =  \\alpha_{\\rm B}\\frac{I d\\mathbf{l} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat r}}{r^2}\\;,</math> where ''r'' and <math>\\mathbf{\\hat r}</math> are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector '''r''' respectively.\nThese two laws can be used to derive [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] above, resulting in the relationship: <math>k_{\\rm A}  = \\alpha_{\\rm L} \\cdot \\alpha_{\\rm B}\\;</math>. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] such that <math>k_{\\rm A}  = 1</math>, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting <math>\\alpha_{\\rm L} = \\alpha_{\\rm B}=1\\;</math>. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.\n\nFurthermore, if we wish to describe the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field]] '''H''' in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants \u03b5<sub>0</sub> and \u03bc<sub>0</sub>, which are the [[vacuum permittivity]] and [[magnetic constant|permeability]], respectively. <!-- These two values are related by <math>\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}=\\alpha_{\\rm B} / c</math>. // removed this statement - seems impossible to prove! --> Then we have<ref name=Jack/> (generally) <math>\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\lambda \\mathbf{P}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{B} / \\mu_0 - \\lambda^\\prime \\mathbf{M}</math>, where '''P''' and '''M''' are [[polarization density]] and [[magnetization]] vectors. The units of '''P''' and '''M''' are usually so chosen that the factors \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 are equal to the \"rationalization constants\" <math>4 \\pi k_{\\rm C} \\epsilon_0</math> and <math>4 \\pi \\alpha_{\\rm B} / (\\mu_0 \\alpha_{\\rm L})</math>, respectively. If the rationalization constants are equal, then <math>c^2 = 1 / (\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0 \\alpha_{\\rm L}^2)</math>.

Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small quantities that arise for electromagnetic units in the esu and emu systems.  This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and amp had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881.<ref>Paul Tunbridge, ''Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units'', pp. 34-40, IET, 1992 {{ISBN|0863412378}}.</ref>  As well as the volt and amp, the [[farad]] (capacitance), [[ohm]] (resistance), [[coulomb]] (electric charge), and [[henry (unit)|henry]] are consequently also used in the practical system and are the same as the SI units.  However, [[intensive properties]] (that is, anything that is per unit length, area, or volume) will not be the same as SI since the cgs unit of distance is the centimetre.  For instance [[electric field strength]] is in units of volts per centimetre, [[magnetic field strength]] is in [[oersted]]s and [[resistivity]] is in ohm-cm.<ref>Heinz E.

The symbol \"\u2194\" is used instead of \"=\" as a reminder that the SI and CGS units are ''corresponding'' but not ''equal'' because they have incompatible dimensions. For example, according to the next-to-last row of the table, if a capacitor has a capacitance of 1&nbsp;F in SI, then it has a capacitance of (10<sup>\u22129</sup> ''c''<sup>2</sup>) cm in ESU; ''but'' it is usually incorrect to replace \"1&nbsp;F\" with \"(10<sup>\u22129</sup>&nbsp;''c''<sup>2</sup>) cm\" within an equation or formula.

Also, lack of unique unit names leads to a great confusion: thus \u201c15 emu\u201d may mean either 15 [[abvolt]]s, or 15 emu units of [[electric dipole moment]], or 15 emu units of [[magnetic susceptibility]], sometimes (but not always) per [[gram]], or per [[mole (unit)|mole]]. On the other hand, SI starts with a unit of current, the [[ampere]], that is easier to determine through experiment, but which requires extra multiplicative factors in the electromagnetic equations. With its system of uniquely named units, the SI also removes any confusion in usage: 1.0 ampere is a fixed value of a specified quantity, and so are 1.0 [[henry (unit)|henry]], 1.0 [[ohm]], and 1.0 volt.\n\nA key virtue of the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian CGS system]] is that electric and magnetic fields have the same units, 4''\u03c0\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is replaced by 1, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the [[Maxwell equations]] is ''c'', the speed of light. The [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Heaviside\u2013Lorentz system]] has these desirable properties as well (with ''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> equaling 1), but it is a \u201crationalized\u201d system (as is SI) in which the charges and fields are defined in such a way that there are many fewer factors of 4''\u03c0'' appearing in the formulas, and it is in Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units that the Maxwell equations take their simplest form.\n\nIn SI, and other rationalized systems (for example, [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Heaviside\u2013Lorentz]]), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4\u03c0, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2\u03c0 and those dealing with charged surfaces lack \u03c0 entirely, which was the most convenient choice for applications in [[electrical engineering]]. However, modern [[calculator|hand calculator]]s and [[personal computer]]s have eliminated this \"advantage\". In some fields where formulas concerning spheres are common (for example, in  astrophysics), it has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that the nonrationalized CGS system can be somewhat more convenient notationally.\n\nSpecialized unit systems are used to simplify formulas even further than ''either'' SI ''or'' CGS, by eliminating constants through some system of [[natural units]]. For example, in [[particle physics]] a system is in use where every quantity is expressed by only one unit of energy, the [[electronvolt]], with lengths, times, and so on all converted into electronvolts by inserting factors of [[speed of light|speed of light ''c'']] and the [[Planck constant|Planck constant ''\u0127'']]. This unit system is very convenient for calculations in [[particle physics]], but it would be considered impractical in other contexts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units]]\n* [[List of scientific units named after people]]\n* [[Metre\u2013tonne\u2013second system of units]]\n* [[United States customary units]]\n\n==References and notes==\n<div class=\"references\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==General literature==\n* {{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. |authorlink= David Griffiths (physicist) | title=Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd ed.)| publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-805326-X | chapter=Appendix C: Units}}\n* {{cite book | author=Jackson, John D. |authorlink=John David Jackson (physicist) | title=Classical Electrodynamics (3rd ed.) | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | year=1999 | isbn=0-471-30932-X | chapter=Appendix on Units and Dimensions }}\n* {{cite book | author=Kent, William |authorlink=William Kent (Consulting Engineer) | title=The Mechanical Engineer's Pocket-book (5th ed.) |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | year=1900 | chapter=Electrical Engineering.

Before his active missionary work, there were already groups of Christians across the region. For example, a large group already existed in Rome even before Paul visited the place.

Paul himself consulted and sought guidance from the Christian leaders in Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1-2; Acts 9:26-28, 15:2). \u201cWhat was common to the whole Christian movement derived from Jerusalem, not from Paul, and Paul himself derived the central message he preached from the Jerusalem apostles.<ref>R.

Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25752-6}} p. 106</ref>\n\nA central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened \"with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan\".<ref name=Matera67  >''New Testament christology'' by Frank J. Matera 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25694-5}} p. 67</ref> In this view, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus \"at the hands of the lawless\" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.<ref name=Matera67 /><ref>''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 {{ISBN|0-664-25221-4}} p. 34</ref>\n\nPaul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term \"the cross of Christ\" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.<ref name=Schwarz132 >''Christology'' by Hans Schwarz 1998 {{ISBN|0-8028-4463-4}} pp 132\u201334</ref> For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in Cor 2:8.<ref name=Schwarz132 /> In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Phil 2:8), died \"at the right time\" (Rom 4:25) based on the plan of God.<ref name=Schwarz132 /> For Paul, the \"power of the cross\" is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.<ref name=Schwarz132 />\n\n===Threefold office===\n{{Main|threefold office}}\n\nThe [[threefold office]] (Latin ''munus triplex'') of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] is a [[Christian]] doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by [[Eusebius]] and more fully developed by [[John Calvin]]. It states that Jesus [[Christ]] performed three functions (or \"offices\") in his earthly ministry&nbsp;\u2013  those of [[prophet]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018:14-22;&version=31; Deuteronomy 18:14\u201322]), [[priest]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110:1-4;&version=31; Psalm 110:1-4]), and [[kingly office of Christ|king]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202;&version=31; Psalm 2]).  In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head.  Thus, the term messiah, meaning \"anointed one\", is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the [[Book of Hebrews]].\n\n===Mariology===\n{{main|Roman Catholic Mariology}}\nSome Christians, notably [[RCTerm|Roman Catholics]], view [[Mariology]] as a key component of Christology.<ref>\"Mariology Is Christology\", in [[Vittorio Messori]], ''The Mary Hypothesis'', Rome: 2005. [http://www.zenit.org/article-14658?l=english]</ref> In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete, since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.<ref>Paul Haffner, 2004 ''The mystery of Mary'' Gracewing Press {{ISBN|0-85244-650-0}} p. 17</ref>\n\nProtestants have criticized Mariology because many of its assertions lack any biblical foundation.<ref>Walter A.

The kingdom was depopulated and exhausted by war, and the [[economic system|economy]] was ruined. In 1335, in the [[Treaty of Trentschin]], Casimir was forced to relinquish his claims to [[Silesia]] \"in perpetuity\".\n\nKazimierz rebuilt and his kingdom became prosperous and wealthy, with great prospects for the future. He waged many victorious wars and doubled the size of the kingdom, mostly through addition of lands in modern-day [[Ukraine]] (then called the Duchy of [[Halych]]). Kazimierz built extensively during his reign, ordering the construction of over 40 castles, including many castles along the [[Trail of the Eagle's Nests]], and he reformed the Polish [[army]].\n\nAt the [[Sejm]] in [[Wi\u015blica]], on 11 March 1347, Kazimierz introduced reforms to the Polish judicial system and sanctioned [[Civil law (private law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] codes for Great and Lesser Poland, earning the title \"the Polish Justinian.\"<ref name=\"Saxton\" /> He founded the [[University of Krak\u00f3w]],<ref name=\"Saxton535\"/> the oldest Polish University, and he organized a [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w|meeting of kings in Krak\u00f3w]] in 1364 at which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Kazimierz is the only king in Polish history to both receive and retain the title of \"Great\" ([[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]] is also called \"Great\", but more commonly \"Valiant\").\n\n===Succession===\nIn 1355, in [[Buda]], Kazimierz designated his nephew [[Louis I of Hungary]] as his successor should he produce no male heir, as his father had with [[Charles I of Hungary]] to gain his help against Bohemia. In exchange Kazimierz gained Hungarian favourable attitude, needed in disputes with the hostile Teutonic Order and Kingdom of Bohemia. Kazimierz at the time was still in his early years and having a son did not seem to be a problem (he already had a few children).\n\n[[File:Subdue of Ruthenia in 1366.png|thumb|left|''[[The Second Taking of Ruthenia.

The child had been born to his second daughter, [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326\u20131361)|Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania]], in 1351. This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to [[Krak\u00f3w]] quickly after Kazimierz died and bribed the nobles with future privileges. Kazimierz III had a son-in-law, [[Louis VI the Roman|Louis VI]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Kazimierz's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue. \n \nThus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king upon Kazimierz's death in 1370, though Kazimierz's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00luko|title=A concise history of Poland|last=Lukowski|first=Jerzy|last2=Zawadzki|first2=Hubert|date=2016|orig-year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521853323|pages=34}}</ref>\n\n==Society under the reign of Casimir==\n[[Image:Wiec Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|''[[Veche#Poland|Wiec]]'' in reign of Casimir the Great]]\n\nCasimir was facetiously named \"the Peasants' King\". He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility. During his reign all three major classes \u2014 the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie \u2014 were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position. He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen.

The marriage produced two daughters, Cunigunde (d. 1357), who was married to [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth, who was married to Duke [[Bogislaw V|Bogislaus V of Pomerania]]. Aldona died in 1339, and Casimir then married [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. He divorced Adelaide in 1356, married Christina, divorced her, and while Adelaide and possibly Christina were still alive (ca. 1365), he married Hedwig of G\u0142og\u00f3w and Sagan.

Casimir remained a widower for two years.\n\n===Adelheid of Hesse===\nOn 29 September 1341, Casimir married his second wife, [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse]], and Elizabeth of Meissen. They had no children. Casimir started living separately from Adelaide soon thereafter. Their loveless marriage lasted until 1356.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rhode|first1=Gotthold K.S.|title=Casimir III|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Casimir-III|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Christina===\nCasimir effectively divorced Adelaide and married his mistress [[Christina Rokiczana]], the widow of Miklusz Rokiczani, a wealthy merchant. Her own origins are unknown. Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of [[Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[Tyniec]] to marry them. The marriage was held in a secret ceremony but soon became known. Queen Adelaide renounced it as [[Polygamy|bigamous]] and returned to Hesse without permission. Casimir continued living with Christine despite complaints by [[Pope Innocent VI]] on behalf of Queen Adelaide. The marriage lasted until 1363\u201364 when Casimir again declared himself divorced. They had no children. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Hedwig of \u017baga\u0144===\nIn about 1365, Casimir married his fourth wife [[Hedwig of Sagan|Hedwig of \u017baga\u0144]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry V of Iron]], Duke of [[\u017baga\u0144]] and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children:\n*[[Anna of Poland, Countess of Celje]] (1366 \u2013 9 June 1422); married firstly William of Celje; their only daughter was [[Anne of Cilli|Anne]], who married [[Jogaila|Jogaila of Lithuania]] (who at the time was King of Poland).

The legitimacy of the three last daughters was disputed. Casimir managed to have Anne and Cunigunde legitimated by [[Pope Urban V]] on 5 December 1369. Jadwiga the younger was legitimated by [[Pope Gregory XI]] on 11 October 1371.<ref>''Pope Gregory XI: the Failure of Tradition'' {{ISBN|978-0-819-15463-7}} p. 119</ref>\n\n===Esterka===\n[[Esterka]] was the only one who gave him male offspring. She had a significant place in Casimir's life. She was a legendarily beautiful and intelligent woman who even performed as a king's adviser in support of various initiatives: building stone cities, tolerance to representatives of different religious faiths, free trade and support of cultural development.\n\nIt was she who laid the foundations of a tolerant attitude towards Jews in Poland and it remained so for centuries, making this country \"[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|a paradise for the Jews]]\". Casimir was not only loyal to the Jews, but also encouraged them, as a result of it the country experienced phenomenal economic and cultural growth. Casimir was called The Great King for his wisdom. The sons of King Casimir and Esterka, Pelko and Nemir, were baptized at the request of their father and became the ancestors of several Polish noble families: Rudanovsky and . To develop legal and commercial relations between Jews, Poles and Germans, Pelko was sent to Konitz and his brother Nemir in 1363 to the southwest to Lower Silesia to participate in the foundation of the city of Neurode, which later became the patrimonial nest of the new Nourode's Rudanovsky dynasty.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.'''Casimir III the Great'''\n|2= 2.[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]\n|3= 3.[[Jadwiga of Kalisz]]\n|4= 4.[[Casimir I of Kuyavia]]\n|5= 5.[[Euphrosyne of Opole]]\n|6= 6.[[Boleslaus of Greater Poland|Boleslaus the Pious]] of Greater Poland\n|7= 7.[[Jolenta of Poland|Blessed Jolenta]]\n|8= 8.[[Konrad I of Masovia]]\n|9= 9.[[Agafia of Rus]]\n|10=10.[[Casimir I of Opole]]\n|11=11.[[Viola, Duchess of Opole|Wiola-Wencis\u0142awa]]\n|12=12.[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic]]\n|13=13.[[Jadwiga of Pomerania]]\n|14=14.[[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]\n|15=15.[[Maria Laskarina]]\n|16=16.[[Casimir II the Just]]\n|17=17.[[Helena of Znojmo]]\n|18=18.[[Svyatoslav III Igorevich]]\n|19=19.[[Yaroslava Rurikovna]]\n|20=20.[[Mieszko IV Tanglefoot]]\n|21=21.[[Ludmilla(wife of Mieszko I Tanglefoot)|Ludmilla]]\n|22=\n|23=\n|24=24.[[Odon of Pozna\u0144]]\n|25=25.[[Viacheslava of Halych]]\n|26=\n|27=\n|28=28.[[Andrew II of Hungary]]\n|29=29.[[Gertrude of Merania]]\n|30=30.[[Theodore I Laskaris]] of Nicaea\n|31=31.[[Anna Komnene Angelina]]\n}}\n\n==Title and style==\nCasimir's full title was: ''Casimir by the grace of God king of [[Poland]] and Russia (Ruthenia), lord and heir of the land of [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sandomierz Voivodeship|Sandomierz]], [[Sieradz]], [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Pomerelia|Pomerania (Pomerelia)]]''.

Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.\n\n[[Warren Weaver]] posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.<ref name=Weaver>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Weaver\n  | first = Warren\n  | title = Science and Complexity\n  | journal = American Scientist\n  | volume = 36\n  | pages = 536\u201344\n  | year = 1948\n  | url = http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L1/Material/WEAVER1947.pdf\n  | pmid = 18882675\n  | issue = 4\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-21}}\n</ref>\nPhenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront \"dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole\".<ref name=Weaver/> Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Johnson\n  | first = Steven\n  | title = Emergence: the connected lives of ants, brains, cities, and software\n  | publisher = Scribner\n  | year = 2001\n  | page = 46\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 0-684-86875-X}}\n</ref>\n\nThe approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.\n\nSome definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.\n\n== Disorganized vs. organized ==\nOne of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.\n\nWeaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between \"disorganized complexity\" and \"organized complexity\".\n\nIn Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a \"disorganized complexity\" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.\n\nA prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of planetary orbits \u2013 the latter can be predicted by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern [[chaos theory]].<ref>\"Sir James Lighthill and Modern Fluid Mechanics\", by Lokenath Debnath, The University of Texas-Pan American, US, Imperial College Press: {{ISBN|978-1-84816-113-9}}: {{ISBN|1-84816-113-1}}, Singapore, page 31.

These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to \"emerge,\" without any \"guiding hand\".\n\nThe number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Jacobs\n  | first = Jane\n  | title = The Death and Life of Great American Cities\n  | publisher = Random House\n  | year = 1961\n  | location = New York }}\n</ref>\n\n== Sources and factors ==\nThere are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.\n\nThe source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.\n\nIn the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.<ref>Ulanowicz, Robert, \"Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective\", Columbia, 1997</ref>\n\nComplexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.\n\n== Varied meanings ==\nIn several scientific fields, \"complexity\" has a precise meaning:\n\n* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm. This allows classification of computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP,]] etc.). An axiomatic approach to computational complexity was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.\n* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. [[Minimum message length]] is a practical application of this approach. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].<ref>Burgin, M. (1982) Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations, Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v.25, No. 3, pp. 19\u201323</ref> The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to Kolmogorov complexity. It is possible to treat different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).\n* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].\n* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[Quantum state|state vector]] of the system. This should not be confused with [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy in [[statistical mechanics]].\n* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn\u2013Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].\n* In [[Network theory]] complexity is the product of richness in the connections between components of a system,<ref>A complex network analysis example: \"[http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/ Complex Structures and International Organizations]\" ({{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia.

This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.\n* In [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] sense \u2013 Abstract Complexity, is based on visual structures [[perception]] <ref>Mariusz Stanowski (2011) Abstract Complexity Definition, Complicity 2, p.78-83 [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/complicity/article/view/11156]</ref> It is complexity of binary string defined as a square of features number divided by number of elements (0's and 1's). Features comprise here all distinctive arrangements of 0's and 1's. Though the features number have to be always approximated the definition is precise and meet intuitive criterion.\n\nOther fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:\n\n* A [[complex adaptive system]] has some or all of the following attributes:<ref name=\"Neil Johnson\" />\n** The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial \u2013 however, there is no general rule to separate \"trivial\" from \"non-trivial\";\n** The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];\n** The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;\n** The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;\n** The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment;\n** The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.\n\n== Study ==\nComplexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex \u2013 displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]] \u2013 is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.\n\nThe use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting \"stovepipes\" and effective \"integrated\" solutions.<ref>[[Lissack, Michael R.]]; [[Johan Roos]] (2000). ''The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity.'' Intercultural Press. {{ISBN|978-1-85788-235-3}}.\n</ref> This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.\n\nWhile this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s, social systems<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30193748/Complexics_as_a_Meta-Transdisciplinary_Field|title=Complexics as a meta-transdisciplinary field|last=Bastardas-Boada|first=Albert|date=|website=Academia.edu|access-date=}}</ref>. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].\n\n== Topics ==\n\n=== Behaviour ===\nThe behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and [[self-organization]]. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.\n\n===Mechanisms ===\nRecent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].\n\n=== Simulations ===\nIn [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].\n\n=== Systems ===\n{{main article|Complex system}}\n[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (in recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including [[biology]], [[economics]], social studies and [[technology]]. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al, [[non-linearity|non-linear]], and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.\n\n=== Data ===\nIn [[information theory]], algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.\n\nComplex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command \"X\" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like \"18995316\"), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the \"translation\" language \u2013 which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.\n\nThese algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity{{who|date=October 2013}}.\n\n[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.\n\nRecent work in [[machine learning]] has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] for [[binary classification]] problems.<ref>Ho, T.K.; Basu, M. (2002). \"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=990132&tag=1 Complexity Measures of Supervised Classification Problems]\". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (3), pp 289\u2013300.</ref>\n\nThe complexity measures broadly cover:\n* the overlaps in feature values from differing classes.\n* the separability of the classes.\n* measures of geometry, topology, and density of [[manifold]]s. Instance hardness is another approach seeks to characterize the data complexity with the goal of determining how hard a data set is to classify correctly and is not limited to binary problems.<ref>Smith, M.R.; Martinez, T.; Giraud-Carrier, C. (2014). \"[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5422-z An Instance Level Analysis of Data Complexity]\". Machine Learning, 95(2): 225\u2013256.</ref> \nInstance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial<ref>Saez, J.; Luengo, J.; Herrera, F.

Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm \u2013 usually a computer program \u2013 to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time <math>O(n^2 2^n)</math> (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit \u2013 the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.\n\nEven though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.\n\nThere exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].\n\nThere is another form of complexity called [[Model of hierarchical complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Chaos theory]]\n* [[Command and Control Research Program]]\n* [[Complex systems]]\n* [[Complexity theory (disambiguation)|Complexity theory]] (disambiguation page)\n* [[Cyclomatic complexity]]\n* [[Digital morphogenesis]]\n* [[Dual-phase evolution]]\n* [[Emergence]]\n* [[Evolution of complexity]]\n* [[Game complexity]]\n* [[Holism in science]]\n* [[Law of Complexity/Consciousness]]\n* [[Model of hierarchical complexity]]\n* [[Names of large numbers]]\n* [[Network science]]\n* [[Network theory]]\n* [[Novelty theory]]\n* [[Occam's razor]]\n* [[Process architecture]]\n* [[Programming Complexity]]\n* [[Sociology and complexity science]]\n* [[Systems theory]]\n* [[Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity]]\n* [[Variety (cybernetics)]]\n* [[Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity]]\n* [[Computational irreducibility]]\n*[[Zero-Force Evolutionary Law]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Chu\n  | first = Dominique\n  | title = Complexity: Against Systems\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | journal = Theory in Biosciences\n  | year = 2011\n  | pmid =21287293  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Waldrop\n  | first = M.

Chastity is usually defined within the [[morality|moral]] standards and guidelines of a culture, civilization or [[religion]]. The term is closely associated (and can be used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially in the context of [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity |title=Chastity &#124; Define Chastity at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chastity |title=Chastity &#124; Define Chastity at Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe words \"chaste\" and \"chastity\" stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' (\"pure\"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. At that time, they meant slightly different things. \"Chaste\" meant \"virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse\" (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),<ref name=etymonlineChaste>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste|title=chaste - Origin and meaning of chaste by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=podDictEtym>{{cite web|url=http://podictionary.com/?p=605|title=podictionary - for word lovers - daily stories, trivia & dictionary etymology|author=|date=|website=podictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\nwhile \"chastity\" meant \"virginity\".<ref name=\"podDictEtym\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity|title=chastity - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> Not until the late 16th century did the two words come to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.<ref name=\"etymonlineChaste\" /><ref name=\"podDictEtym\" />\n\n==In Abrahamic religions ==\nFor many Muslims and Christians, acts of sexual nature are [[fornication|restricted to marriage]]. For unmarried persons, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]], and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Redirect|Vow of chastity|vows of Catholic Religious|Evangelical counsels|vows of chastity in other Christian Churches|Religious vows}}\n\nIn many [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. In [[Catholicism|Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]]. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.\n\nIn [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called \"vidual chastity\", is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband. For example, Anglican Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''Holy Living'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying \"so long as she is with child by her former husband\" and \"within the year of mourning\".<ref>{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}</ref>\n\nThe particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, Roman Catholics view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as unnatural, contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size by artificial contraception as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity. The [[Catholic Church]] has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while most Protestant communities allow clergy to marry.\n\nCelibacy is required of [[Monasticism|monastic]]s\u2014monks, nuns and friars\u2014even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Required celibacy among the clergy is a relatively recent practice: it became Church policy at the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. It was not uniformly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later.<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28</ref> Eastern Catholic priests are permitted to marry, provided they do so before ordination and outside monastic life.\n\n''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]] in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to [[contemplation]]), or both. Some protestant religious communities, such as the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], take vows<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-order/our-vows|title=Our Vows|website=Bruderhof|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}</ref> of chastity as part of the church membership process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the main [[counsels of perfection]].\n\nChastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Roman Catholic teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.<ref>{{citation |chapter=I. \"Male and Female He Created Them . . .\" |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P84.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}</ref>{{rp|2332}} It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.<ref>{{citation |chapter=II. The Vocation to Chastity |title=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] |chapter-url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P85.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana}}</ref>{{rp|2339}} By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.\n\nIn [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), chastity is very important, quoting:\n\n<blockquote>\"Physical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. The law of chastity applies to both men and women. It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage.\n\n\"The law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.\n\n\"In addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught,\"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart\" (Matthew 5:27\u201328).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/chastity/what-is-the-law-of-chastity?lang=eng|title=What Is the Law of Chastity?|author=|date=|website=lds.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLDS teaching also includes that sexual expression within marriage is an important dimension of spousal bonding apart from, but not necessarily avoiding its procreative result.\n\n=== Islam ===\nChastity is mandatory in Islam. Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women whether married or unmarried.\n\nThe most famous personal example of chastity in the Quran is Virgin Mary (Mariam) :\n\n\"And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.\" (21 :91)\n\n'''\"'''And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.She said, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah .\"He said, \"I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.\"She said, \"How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?\"'''\"''' (19:17-20)\n\nExtramarital sex is forbidden and the Quran says:\n\n\"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.\" (17:32)\n\n\"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" (25:68-70)\n\nThe injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women.  Social hypocrisy in many societies over history had led to a double standard when considering sin committed by men versus sin committed by women. Society tended to be more lenient and permissive towards men forgiving men for sins not forgivable when women do them. At the root of the contemporary wave of free sex for both sexes was apparently to establish equality and remove discrimination between man and woman. Instead of calling for equal cleanliness the call was for equal dirt. Not so in Islam. and in a list of commendable deeds the Quran says:\n\n\"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.\" (33:35)\n\nBecause the sex desire is usually attained before a man is financially capable of marriage, the love to God and mindfulness of Him should be sufficient motive for chastity:\n\n\"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.\" (24:33) The prophet's prescription to the youth was:\n\nThose of you who own the means should marry for this should keep their eyes uncraving and their chastity secure. Those who don't, may practise fasting for it curbs desire. \" (Ibn Massoud)\n\nChastity is an attitude and a way of life. In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices bent on flaring up the sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam be the means permissive ideologies, pruritic art or neglect of moral upbringing.  Personal freedoms should never be taught as the freedom to challenge God's injunctions or trespass over the limits He drew.\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\nChastity is highly prized in the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teachings]] call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed marriage]], and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immoderate attire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Compilation of Compilations (Volume 1)|last=Research Department|first=Universal House of Justice|publisher=Baha'i Publications Australia|year=1991|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=|chapter=A Chaste and Holy Life}}</ref>\n\n== In Eastern religions ==\n\n===Hinduism===\n[[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of [[Ashrama (stage)]] or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[student]]s during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder ([[Grihastha]]). [[Sanyasa|Sanyasis]] and Hindu monks or [[Sadhu]]s are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline.\n\n===Sikhism===\nIn [[Sikhism]], premarital or extra-marital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to sannyasa or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.\n\n=== Jainism ===\nCelibacy is a must for all [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks and nuns]]. Chastity (Bhramacharya) is one of the five major vows of [[Jainism]]. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.\n\n===Buddhism===\nThe teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], comprising a division called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]]. Under the [[Five Precepts]] ethical code, [[Up\u0101saka and Up\u0101sik\u0101]] lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while [[Bhikkhu]] and [[Bhikkhuni]] monastics should practice strict chastity.\n\n=== Daoism ===\nThe [[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]]  of the [[Daoist]] religion include No Sexual Misconduct, which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Law of chastity]]\n* [[Seven virtues]]\n* [[Ten Commandments]]\n* [[Theology of the body]]\n* [[Virtue]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Chastity}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary|chastity}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090304123934/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church (III.2.I)]\n*[http://www.passtheword.org/SHAKER-MANUSCRIPTS/Abstinence/shaker-abst-x1.htm Early Shaker Writings Relating to Sexual Abstinence]\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03637d.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Chastity]\n\n{{Catholic virtue ethics}}\n\n[[Category:Virtue]]\n[[Category:Seven virtues]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of love]]\n[[Category:Sexual abstinence]]\n[[Category:Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]\n\n{{Authority control}}", "sha1": "ijeybnso08003gwzwu8zclmr9s7sh9b"}}, {"title": "Causes of heterosexuality", "ns": "0", "id": "7372", "redirect": {"title": "Sexual orientation"}, "revision": {"id": "15905443", "parentid": "13523910", "timestamp": "2005-05-10T20:22:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "K1Bond007", "id": "18048"}, "comment": "Fix Double Redirect - [[WP:WS|Please help out by clicking here to fix someone else's Wiki syntax]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Sexual orientation]]", "sha1": "71ynqlmwdyoaadwt2g5ecskzhalhbue"}}, {"title": "Causes of sexual orientation", "ns": "0", "id": "7375", "redirect": {"title": "Sexual orientation"}, "revision": {"id": "838783435", "parentid": "817409653", "timestamp": "2018-04-29T08:31:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Add template{{R to section}} to categorize redirect using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Sexual orientation#Causes]]\n\n{{R to section}}", "sha1": "lq1oh9jbu4ooixrnbmuk98mvon564xr"}}, {"title": "Cosmic microwave background", "ns": "0", "id": "7376", "revision": {"id": "865682595", "parentid": "865682576", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T14:07:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/Encyclic121323|Encyclic121323]] to version by Citation bot.

In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or \"relic radiation\". The CMB is a faint [[cosmic background radiation]] filling all space that is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the [[epoch of recombination]]. With a traditional [[optical telescope]], the space between stars and galaxies (the ''background'') is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive [[radio telescope]] shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost [[isotropic]], that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the [[microwave]] region of the radio spectrum.

When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] fog.<ref>{{cite serial |last=Kaku |first=M. |author-link=Michio Kaku |date=2014 |episode=First Second of the Big Bang |title=[[How the Universe Works]] |season=3 |number=4 |network=[[Science Channel|Discovery Science]]}}</ref> [[Cosmologists]] refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] epoch'', and the event shortly afterwards when [[photons]] started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is referred to as photon [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less [[photon energy|energetic]], since the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] causes their [[wavelength]] to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to [[Planck's relation]]).

The glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual variations show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot [[gas]] that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spectral radiance at different angles of observation in the sky contains small [[anisotropy|anisotropies]], or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by [[quantum fluctuations]] of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the [[observable universe]] we see today. This is a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]]) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion. Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMB.\n\nThe high degree of uniformity throughout the [[observable universe]] and its faint but measured anisotropy lend strong support for the Big Bang model in general and the [[\u039bCDM model|\u039bCDM (\"Lambda Cold Dark Matter\") model]] in particular.

In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if there was a big bang, the expansion of the universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and down to a temperature of about 5&nbsp;K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.<ref name=\"Apeiron2_3_79\"/>\n\nThe CMB gives a snapshot of the [[universe]] when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form [[hydrogen]] atoms, thereby making the universe nearly transparent to radiation because light was no longer being [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] off free electrons. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang\u2014this time is generally known as the \"time of last scattering\" or the period of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] or [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]\u2014the temperature of the universe was about 3000&nbsp;K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.26&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Convert?exp=3&num=3&From=k&To=ev&Action=Convert+value+and+show+factor | title=Converted number: Conversion from K to eV}}</ref> which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=astro-ph/9508159|last1=Fixsen|first1=D.

As the universe expands, the CMB photons are [[redshift]]ed, causing them to decrease in energy. The temperature of this radiation stays [[inversely proportional]] to a parameter that describes the relative expansion of the universe over time, known as the [[scale factor (universe)|scale length]]. The temperature ''T''<sub>r</sub> of the CMB as a function of redshift, ''z'', can be shown to be proportional to the temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725&nbsp;K or 0.2348 meV):<ref>{{cite journal | author=Noterdaeme, P. | author2=Petitjean, P. | author3=Srianand, R. | author4=Ledoux, C. | author5=L\u00f3pez, S. | title=The evolution of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

The data shown comes from the [[WMAP]] (2006), [[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver|Acbar]] (2004) [[BOOMERanG experiment|Boomerang]] (2005), [[Cosmic Background Imager|CBI]] (2004), and [[Very Small Array|VSA]] (2004) instruments. Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line).]]\nThe [[anisotropy]], or directional dependency, of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two types: primary anisotropy, due to effects that occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.\n\nThe structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and [[diffusion damping]] (also called collisionless damping or [[Joseph Silk|Silk]] damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the [[photon]]\u2013[[baryon]] plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.\n\nThe peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] (but not the [[topology]] of the universe). The next peak\u2014ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks\u2014determines the reduced baryon density.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/baryons.html |title=Baryons and Inertia |author=Wayne Hu}}</ref> The third peak can be used to get information about the dark-matter density.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/driving.html |title=Radiation Driving Force |author=Wayne Hu}}</ref>\n\nThe locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental types of density perturbations called ''adiabatic'' and ''isocurvature''. A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures.\n; Adiabatic density perturbations: In an adiabatic density perturbation, the fractional additional number density of each type of particle ([[baryon]]s, [[photon]]s ...) is the same. That is, if at one place there is a 1% higher number density of baryons than average, then at that place there is also a 1% higher number density of photons (and a 1% higher number density in neutrinos) than average. [[Cosmic inflation]] predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic.\n; Isocurvature density perturbations: In an isocurvature density perturbation, the sum (over different types of particle) of the fractional additional densities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% ''less'' energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. [[Cosmic string]]s would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.\n\nThe CMB spectrum can distinguish between these two because these two types of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (''l'' values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:...<ref name=\"hu_white_1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hu |first=W.|last2=White|first2=M.|year=1996|title=Acoustic Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=471|pages=30\u201351|doi=10.1086/177951|bibcode=1996ApJ...471...30H|arxiv = astro-ph/9602019 }}</ref> Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.\n\nCollisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as [[fluid]] begins to break down:\n* the increasing [[mean free path]] of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe,\n* the finite depth of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring.\nThese effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies at small scales and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.\n\nThe depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the universe up to that era. One method of quantifying how long this process took uses the ''photon visibility function'' (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by ''P''(''t''), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time ''t'' and {{nobr|''t'' + ''dt''}} is given by ''P''(''t'')&thinsp;''dt''.\n\nThe maximum of the PVF (the time when it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] results put the time at which ''P''(''t'') has a maximum as 372,000 years.<ref name=\"WMAP_1_cosmo_params\">{{cite journal|author=WMAP Collaboration|year=2003|title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Determination of Cosmological Parameters|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]]|volume=148|last2=Verde|issue=1|pages=175\u2013194|first2=L.|doi=10.1086/377226|last3=Peiris|first3=H.

However, to figure out how ''long'' it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximal value (the \"full width at half maximum\", or FWHM) over an interval of 115,000 years. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.\n\n===Late time anisotropy===\nSince the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of [[reionization]] during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.\n\nThe CMB photons are scattered by free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB:\n# Small scale anisotropies are erased. (Just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy.)\n# The physics of how photons are scattered by free electrons ([[Thomson scattering]]) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This broad angle polarization is correlated with the broad angle temperature perturbation.\n\nBoth of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a [[redshift]] more than 17.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars ([[population III]] stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes.\n\nThe time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background\u2014and before the observation of the first stars\u2014is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|dark age]], and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (see [[21 centimeter radiation]]).\n\nTwo other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, are the [[Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect]], where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the [[Sachs\u2013Wolfe effect]], which causes photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.\n\n==Polarization==\n[[Image:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This artist's impression shows how light from the early universe is deflected by the gravitational lensing effect of massive cosmic structures forming B-modes as it travels across the universe.]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] -->\nThe cosmic microwave background is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] at the level of a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to [[electrostatics]], in which the electric field (''E''-field) has a vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the magnetic field (''B''-field) has a vanishing [[divergence]]. The E-modes arise naturally from [[Thomson scattering]] in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the [[South Pole Telescope]] in 2013;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=D.|year=2013|title=Detection of B-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background with data from the South Pole Telescope|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=111|issue=14|pages=141301|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.141301|pmid=24138230|arxiv=1307.5830|url = http://www.nature.com/news/polarization-detected-in-big-bang-s-echo-1.13441 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111n1301H |display-authors=etal}}</ref> the second one is from [[gravitational wave]]s arising from [[cosmic inflation]].

The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] Cosmic Background Explorer ([[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]) satellite that orbited in 1989\u20131996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic string]]s as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is [[flat space|flat]]. A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI), and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.\n\n[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|center|800px]]<small><center>All-sky [[Mollweide projection|mollweide]] map of the [[CMB]], created from 9 years of [[WMAP]] data</center></small>\n[[File:PIA16874-CobeWmapPlanckComparison-20130321.jpg|thumb|240px|Comparison of [[CMB]] results from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]<br />(March 21, 2013)]]\nIn June 2001, [[NASA]] launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky.

The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large scale angular fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based [[interferometer]]s.\n\nA third space mission, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] (European Space Agency) [[Planck Surveyor]], was launched in May 2009 and performed an even more detailed investigation until it was shut down in October 2013. Planck employed both [[HEMT]] radiometers and [[bolometer]] technology and measured the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. Its detectors were trialled in the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment\u2014which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date\u2014and in the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the European-led research team behind the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck cosmology probe]] released the mission's all-sky map ([http://esacmt.esac.esa.int/science-e-media/img/61/51553_Planck_CMB_Mollweide_565.jpg 565x318 jpeg], [http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/735683main_pia16873-full_full.jpg 3600x1800 jpeg]) of the cosmic microwave background.<ref name=\"NASA-20130321\">{{cite web|last1=Clavin |first1=Whitney |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=Planck Mission Brings Universe Into Sharp Focus |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-109&rn=news.xml&rst=3739 |date=21 March 2013|website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=21 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20130321g\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Mapping the Early Universe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/21/science/space/0321-universe.html |date=21 March 2013 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}</ref> The map suggests the universe is slightly older than researchers expected. According to the map, subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the deep sky when the cosmos was about {{val|370000}} years old.

Apparently, these ripples gave rise to the present vast [[Cosmic Web#Large-scale structure|cosmic web]] of [[galaxy cluster]]s and [[dark matter]].

The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but is too small to be seen at the scale of the raw data. The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun's motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth's annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background.\n\nThe detailed analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple [[Fourier transform]], decomposing the map of the sky into [[spherical harmonics]], in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as [[Bremsstrahlung]], [[Synchrotron radiation#Synchrotron radiation in astronomy|synchrotron]], and [[dust#Dust in other contexts|dust]] that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.\n\nConstraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] sampling techniques.\n\n===CMBR dipole anisotropy===\nFrom the CMB data it is seen that the earth appears to be moving at {{val|368|2|u=km/s}} relative to the reference frame of the CMB (also called the CMB rest frame, or the frame of reference in which there is no motion through the CMB).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Heile|first1=Frank|title=How can one measure speed relative to the rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-measure-speed-relative-to-the-rest-frame-of-the-Cosmic-Microwave-Background-radiation|website=www.quora.com|accessdate=18 May 2018|language=en}}</ref> The [[Local Group]] (the [[galaxy group]] that includes the Milky Way galaxy) appears to be moving at {{val|627|22|u=km/s}} in the direction of galactic longitude ''l'' = {{val|276|3|u=\u00b0}}, ''b'' = {{val|30|3|u=\u00b0}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kogut|first=A.|date=1993|title=Dipole Anisotropy in the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers First-Year Sky Maps|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=419|issue=1993|pages=1\u20136|doi=10.1086/173453|bibcode=1993ApJ...419....1K|arxiv=astro-ph/9312056|last2=Lineweaver |first2=C. |last3=Smoot|first3=G.

More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal \"systems\" (or \"families\") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Noteworthy, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.\n\nAlthough every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}</ref>{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.\n\nThey should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.\n\nThey should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}\n\nAlso, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that \"to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.\" Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:\n\n[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]\n{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}\n\nThe modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}</ref> In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.\n\nThe first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nComparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.\n\n==Purpose==\nComparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,<ref>See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig & Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship</ref> and how their elements combine into a system.\n\nSeveral disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:\n* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect\n* To perfect the legal systems in effect\n* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)\n\n==Relationship with other legal subjects==\nComparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).\n\nDespite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.\n\nAlso, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law & economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: \n* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? \n* Are legal rules comparable? \n* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?\n\n==Classifications of legal systems==\n\n===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff<ref>''Trait\u00e9 de droit compar\u00e9'' \u2013 in French; Paris 1950\u20131952</ref> believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the\n\n* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], [[Louisiana]], states of [[South America]] (such as [[Brazil]]), [[Quebec]], [[Santa Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Egypt]], and [[Lebanon]]\n* [[Law of Germany|German group]]\n* [[Scandinavia]]n group (comprising the laws of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Iceland]])\n* [[Common law|English group]] (incl. [[England]], the [[United States law|United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] ''inter alia'')\n* [[Russia]]n group\n* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])\n* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]\n\n===David===\n[[Ren\u00e9 David]]<ref>''Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de droit civil compar\u00e9: Introduction \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des droits \u00e9trangers et \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950</ref> proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:\n* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:\n** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] \u2013 see also [[Civil law (legal system)]])\n** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]\n* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]\n* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]\n* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]\n* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]\n* [[Jewish Law]]\nEspecially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the [[judge]]s. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are\n* liberal democracy\n* capitalist economy\n* Christian religion\n\n===Zweigert and K\u00f6tz===\nKonrad Zweigert and [[Hein K\u00f6tz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:<ref>Konrad Zweigert, Hein K\u00f6tz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einf\u00fchrung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.</ref>\n* [[Roman law|Roman family]]\n* [[Law of Germany|German family]]\n* [[Common law|Common law family]]\n* [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] family\n* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] ([[Chinese law|China]], and [[Japan]])\n* Religious family ([[Halakha|Jewish]], [[Sharia|Muslim]], and [[Hindu law]])\n\nUp to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and K\u00f6tz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.<ref>Konrad Zweigert, Hein K\u00f6tz: ''Einf\u00fchrung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996.

Under this name the two made a series of installations and images entitled \"sensory spaces\" that were based on the principle of open systems adaptable to various influences, such as human movement and the behaviour of new materials.<ref name=\"kunstkritikk.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kunstkritikk.com/kommentar/the-reinvention-of-cyberspace/ | title=The (Re)invention of Cyberspace}}</ref>\n\nAtelier Cyberspace worked at a time when the Internet did not exist and computers were more or less off-limit to artists and creative engagement. In a 2015-interview with Scandinavian art magazine Kunstkritikk, Carsten Hoff recollects, that although Atelier Cyberspace did try to implement computers, they had no interest in the virtual space as such:<ref name=\"kunstkritikk.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|To us, \"cyberspace\" was simply about managing spaces. There was nothing esoteric about it. Nothing digital, either. It was just a tool. The space was concrete, physical.}}\n\nAnd in the same interview Hoff continues:\n\n{{quote|Our shared point of departure was that we were working with physical settings, and we were both frustrated and displeased with the architecture from the period, particularly when it came to spaces for living. We felt that there was a need to loosen up the rigid confines of urban planning, giving back the gift of creativity to individual human beings and allowing them to shape and design their houses or dwellings themselves \u2013 instead of having some clever architect pop up, telling you how you should live. We were thinking in terms of open-ended systems where things could grow and evolve as required.\n\nFor instance, we imagined a kind of mobile production unit, but unfortunately the drawings have been lost. It was a kind of truck with a nozzle at the back. Like a bee building its hive. The nozzle would emit and apply material that grew to form amorphous mushrooms or whatever you might imagine. It was supposed to be computer-controlled, allowing you to create interesting shapes and sequences of spaces. It was a merging of organic and technological systems, a new way of structuring the world. And a response that counteracted industrial uniformity. We had this idea that sophisticated software might enable us to mimic the way in which nature creates products \u2013 where things that belong to the same family can take different forms. All oak trees are oak trees, but no two oak trees are exactly alike. And then a whole new material \u2013 polystyrene foam \u2013 arrived on the scene. It behaved like nature in the sense that it grew when its two component parts were mixed. Almost like a fungal growth. This made it an obvious choice for our work in Atelier Cyberspace.}}\n\nThe works of Atelier Cyberspace were originally shown at a number of Copenhagen venues and have later been exhibited at The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of the exhibition \"What\u2019s Happening?\"<ref>http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/whats-happening/introduction-to-the-exhibition/</ref>\n\nThe term \"cyberspace\" first appeared in fiction in the 1980s in the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]], first in his 1982 short story \"[[Burning Chrome]]\" and later in his 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''.<ref name=wired>{{cite news |work=WIRED |title=March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace | author=Scott Thil | date=March 17, 2009 | url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317}}</ref> In the next few years, the word became prominently identified with online computer networks.

Author [[Bruce Sterling]], who popularized this meaning,<ref>''Principia Cybernetica'' [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPACE.html \"Cyberspace\"]</ref> credits [[John Perry Barlow]] as the first to use it to refer to \"the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks\". Barlow describes it thus in his essay to announce the formation of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (note the spatial metaphor) in June 1990:<ref>John Perry Barlow, [http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html \"Crime and Puzzlement,\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101093314/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |date=2012-01-01 }} June 8, 1990</ref>\n\n{{quote|In this silent world, all conversation is typed.

It is for these reasons cyberspace has been described as the ultimate [[tax haven]].<ref name=\"tsin\">{{cite book |title=The Sovereign Individual |last=Davidson |first=James Dale |author2=William Rees-Mogg |year=1999 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0684832722 |page=8 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, [[Autodesk]], an American multinational corporation that focuses on 2D and 3D design software, developed a virtual design system called Cyberspace.<ref>Andrew Pollack, New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/for-artificial-reality-wear-a-computer.html \"For Artificial Reality, Wear A Computer,\"] April 10, 1989</ref>\n\n===Recent definitions of Cyberspace===\n\nAlthough several definitions of cyberspace can be found both in scientific literature and in official governmental sources, there is no fully agreed official definition yet. According to F. D. Kramer there are 28 different definitions of the term cyberspace.  See in particular the following links: \"Cyberpower and National Security: Policy Recommendations for a Strategic Framework,\"  in Cyberpower and National Security, FD Kramer, S. Starr, L.K.

Cyberspace includes: a) physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for the connection of technological and communication system networks, understood in the broadest sense (SCADA devices, smartphones/tablets, computers, servers, etc.); b) computer systems (see point a) and the related (sometimes embedded) software that guarantee the domain's basic operational functioning and connectivity; c) networks between computer systems; d) networks of networks that connect computer systems (the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational); e) the access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes; f) constituent data (or resident data).  Often, in common parlance (and sometimes in commercial language), networks of networks are called Internet (with a lowercase i), while networks between computers are called intranet.  Internet (with a capital I, in journalistic language sometimes called the Net) can be considered a part of the system a).  A distinctive and constitutive feature of cyberspace is that no central entity exercises control over all the networks that make up this new domain.<ref>Definition by Marco Mayer, Luigi Martino, Pablo Mazurier and Gergana Tzvetkova, Draft Pisa, 19 May 2014 https://www.academia.edu/7096442/How_would_you_define_Cyberspace</ref>\n \nJust as in the real world there is no world government, cyberspace lacks an institutionally predefined hierarchical center.  To cyberspace, a domain without a hierarchical ordering principle, we can therefore extend the definition of international politics coined by Kenneth Waltz: as being \"with no system of law enforceable.\"  This does not mean that the dimension of power in cyberspace is absent, nor that power is dispersed and scattered into a thousand invisible streams, nor that it is evenly spread across myriad people and organizations, as some scholars had predicted.  On the contrary, cyberspace is characterized by a precise structuring of hierarchies of power.<ref>The most recent analysis of the interaction of Cyberspace and International politics has been investigated in the MIT, Harvard and CFR ECIR project (Explorations in cyber International Relations).

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term [[Heterotopia (space)|heterotopias]], to describe such spaces which are simultaneously physical and mental.\n\nFirstly, cyberspace describes the flow of digital data through the network of interconnected computers: it is at once not \"real\", since one could not spatially locate it as a tangible object, and clearly \"real\" in its effects. There have been several attempts to create a concise model about how cyberspace works since it is not a physical thing that can be looked at. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=William|date=November\u2013December 2013|title=Cyberspace Superiority A Conceptual Model |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a589636.pdf |journal=Air & Space Power Journal|volume=27|pages=25\u201344|via=}}</ref> Secondly, cyberspace is the site of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), in which online relationships and alternative forms of online identity were enacted, raising important questions about the social psychology of Internet use, the relationship between \"online\" and \"offline\" forms of life and interaction, and the relationship between the \"real\" and the virtual. Cyberspace draws attention to remediation of culture through [[new media]] technologies: it is not just a communication tool but a social destination, and is culturally significant in its own right. Finally, cyberspace can be seen as providing new opportunities to reshape society and culture through \"hidden\" identities, or it can be seen as borderless communication and culture.<ref>New Media, an Introduction: Flew, Terry</ref>\n\n{{quote|Cyberspace is the \"place\" where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. '''The place between''' the phones. [...] in the past twenty years, this electrical \"space,\" which was once thin and dark and one-dimensional\u2014little more than a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone\u2014has flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box. Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape. Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now. It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.|Bruce Sterling|Introduction to '''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'''}}\n\nThe \"space\" in cyberspace has more in common with the abstract, mathematical meanings of the term (see [[space]]) than physical space. It does not have the duality of positive and negative volume (while in physical space for example a room has the negative volume of usable space delineated by positive volume of walls, Internet users cannot enter the screen and explore the unknown part of the Internet as an extension of the space they are in), but spatial meaning can be attributed to the relationship between different [[Web page|page]]s (of books as well as [[web server]]s), considering the unturned pages to be somewhere \"out there.\" The concept of cyberspace therefore refers not to the content being presented to the surfer, but rather to the possibility of surfing among different sites, with [[feedback|feedback loops]] between the user and the rest of the system creating the potential to always encounter something unknown or unexpected.\n\n[[Video game]]s differ from text-based communication in that on-screen images are meant to be figures that actually occupy a space and the animation shows the movement of those figures. Images are supposed to form the positive volume that delineates the empty space. A game adopts the cyberspace metaphor by engaging more players in the game, and then figuratively representing them on the screen as [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s. Games do not have to stop at the avatar-player level, but current implementations aiming for more [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] playing space (i.e. [[Laser tag]]) take the form of [[augmented reality]] rather than cyberspace, fully immersive virtual realities remaining impractical.\n\nAlthough the more radical consequences of the global communication network predicted by some cyberspace proponents (i.e. the diminishing of state influence envisioned by John Perry Barlow<ref>John Perry Barlow, [http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\"], February 8, 1996</ref>) failed to materialize and the word lost some of its novelty appeal, it remains current {{as of|2006|lc=y}}.<ref name=\"georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov\"/><ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/scitech/cyber/ ''FindLaw Legal News'' site], Tech and IP: Cyberspace section, retrieved November 14, 2006.</ref>\n\nSome [[virtual communities]] explicitly refer to the concept of cyberspace, for example [[Linden Lab]] calling their customers \"[[Resident (Second Life)|Residents]]\" of [[Second Life]], while all such communities can be positioned \"in cyberspace\" for explanatory and comparative purposes (as did Sterling in ''The Hacker Crackdown'', followed by many journalists), integrating the metaphor into a wider [[cyberculture|cyber-culture]].\n\nThe metaphor has been useful in helping a new generation of thought leaders to reason through new military strategies around the world, led largely by the US Department of Defense (DoD).<ref>Cyber Conflict Studies Association, [http://www.cyberconflict.org CCSA]</ref> The use of cyberspace as a metaphor has had its limits, however, especially in areas where the metaphor becomes confused with physical infrastructure. It has also been critiqued as being unhelpful for falsely employing a spatial metaphor to describe what is inherently a network.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Alternate realities in philosophy and art==\n\n===Predating computers===\nA forerunner of the modern ideas of cyberspace is the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] notion that people might be deceived by an evil demon that feeds them a false reality. This argument is the direct predecessor of modern ideas of a [[brain in a vat]] and many popular conceptions of cyberspace take Descartes's ideas as their starting point.\n\n[[Visual arts]] have a tradition, stretching [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|back to antiquity]], of artifacts meant to [[Trompe-l'\u0153il|fool the eye]] and be mistaken for reality. This questioning of reality occasionally led some philosophers and especially theologians{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} to distrust art as deceiving people into entering a world which was not real (see [[Aniconism]]). The artistic challenge was resurrected with increasing ambition as art became more and more realistic with the invention of photography, film (see ''[[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat|Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat]]''), and immersive computer simulations.\n\n===Influenced by computers===\n\n====Philosophy====\nAmerican [[counterculture]] exponents like [[William S. Burroughs]] (whose literary influence on Gibson and cyberpunk in general is widely acknowledged<ref>[[Alexander Laurence]], [http://www.altx.com/int2/john.shirley.html An Interview with [[John Shirley]]], 1994</ref><ref>[http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/bgtg.htm \"Burroughs/Gysin/Throbbing Gristle\"], retrieved December 31, 2006</ref>) and [[Timothy Leary]]<ref>\"Internet will be the LSD of the 90s\", quoted by [http://www.timothyleary.us/timothyleary.html an on-line biography]</ref> were among the first to extol the potential of computers and computer networks for individual empowerment.<ref>[[Douglas Rushkoff]], [http://www.deepleafproductions.com/utopialibrary/text/rushkoff-godfathers.html \"Godfathers of Cyberspace\"]</ref>\n\nSome contemporary philosophers and scientists (e.g. [[David Deutsch]] in ''The Fabric of Reality'') employ virtual reality in various [[thought experiment]]s. For example, [[Philip Zhai]] in ''Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality'' connects cyberspace to the platonic tradition:\n\n{{quote|Let us imagine a nation in which everyone is hooked up to a network of VR infrastructure. They have been so hooked up since they left their mother's wombs. Immersed in cyberspace and maintaining their life by teleoperation, they have never imagined that life could be any different from that. The first person that thinks of the possibility of an alternative world like ours would be ridiculed by the majority of these citizens, just like the few enlightened ones in Plato's allegory of the cave.}}\n\nNote that this [[brain-in-a-vat]] argument conflates cyberspace with [[reality]], while the more common descriptions of cyberspace contrast it with the \"real world\".\n\n===Cyber-Geography===\nThe \u201cGeography of Notopia\u201d (Papadimitriou, 2006) theorizes about the complex interplay of cyber-cultures and the geographical space. This interplay has several philosophical and psychological facets (Papadimitriou, 2009).\n\n====A New Communication Model====\n\nThe technological convergence of the mass media is the result of a long adaptation process of their communicative resources to the evolutionary changes of each historical moment. Thus, the new media became (plurally) an extension of the traditional media on the cyberspace, allowing to the public access information in a wide range of digital devices.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Communication Model of Virtual Universe |publisher = Grin Verlag|date = 2014-01-28|location = Munich|isbn = 9783656569916|first = Marcelo Mendonca|last = Teixeira|first2 = Tiago Alessandro Espinola|last2 = Ferreira}}</ref> In other words, it is a cultural virtualization of human reality as a result of the migration from physical to virtual space (mediated by the ICTs), ruled by codes, signs and particular social relationships. Forwards, arise instant ways of communication, interaction and possible quick access to information, in which we are no longer mere senders, but also producers, reproducers, co-workers and providers. New technologies also help to \"connect\" people from different cultures outside the virtual space, what was unthinkable fifty years ago. In this giant relationships web, we mutually absorb each other\u2019s beliefs, customs, values, laws and habits, cultural legacies perpetuated by a physical-virtual dynamics in constant metamorphosis (ibidem). In this sense, Professor Doctor Marcelo Mendon\u00e7a Teixeira created, in 2013, a new model of communication to the virtual universe,<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Communication-Model-Virtual-Universe/dp/3656569916</ref> based in Claude Elwood Shannon (1948) article \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\n\n====Art====\n{{Main|New media art}}\n\nHaving originated among writers, the concept of cyberspace remains most popular in literature and film. Although artists working with other media have expressed interest in the concept, such as [[Roy Ascott]], \"cyberspace\" in [[digital art]] is mostly used as a synonym for [[immersive virtual reality]] and remains more discussed than enacted.<ref>Eduardo Kac, [http://www.ekac.org/Telepresence.art._94.html ''\"Telepresence Art\"'']</ref>\n\n====Computer crime====\n{{Main|Computer crime}}\n\nCyberspace also brings together every service and facility imaginable to expedite money laundering. One can purchase anonymous credit cards, bank accounts, encrypted global mobile telephones, and false passports. From there one can pay professional advisors to set up IBCs (International Business Corporations, or corporations with anonymous ownership) or similar structures in OFCs (Offshore Financial Centers). Such advisors are loath to ask any penetrating questions about the wealth and activities of their clients, since the average fees criminals pay them to launder their money can be as much as 20 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8497.00284 |title=Dot.Con: The Dangers of Cyber Crime and a Call for Proactive Solutions |journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume=49 |pages=102\u2013109 |year=2003 |last1=Granville |first1=Johanna }}</ref>\n\n====5-level model====\nIn 2010, a five-level model was designed in France. According to this model, cyberspace is composed of five layers based on information discoveries: language, writing, printing, Internet, etc. This original model links the world of information to telecommunication technologies.\n\n==Popular culture examples==\n* The anime ''[[Digimon]]'' is set in a variant of the cyberspace concept called the \"Digital World\". The Digital World is a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] made up of data from the Internet. Similar to cyberspace, except that people could physically enter this world instead of merely using a computer.\n* The anime ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' is set in the future where cyberization of humanity is commonplace and the world is connected by a vast electronic network. \n* The CGI series, ''[[ReBoot]]'', takes place entirely inside cyberspace, which is composed of two worlds: the Net and the Web.\n* In the film ''[[Tron]]'', a programmer was physically transferred to the program world, where programs were personalities, resembling the forms of their creators.\n* In the film ''[[Virtuosity]]'' a program encapsulating a super-criminal within a virtual world simulation escapes into the \"real world\".\n* In the novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' the author Daniel F. Galouye explores multiple levels of \"reality\" represented by the multiple levels of computer simulation involved.\n* The idea of \"the matrix\" in the film ''[[The Matrix]]'' resembles a complex form of cyberspace where people are \"jacked in\" from birth and do not know that the reality they experience is virtual.\n* In the televised remote controlled robot competition series ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the ''[[Megahurtz]]'' and subsequently ''[[Terrorhurtz]]'' team and their robot were introduced as being \"from Cyberspace\", a nod to their online collaborative formation.\n* In the 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' the author William Gibson introduces the idea of a virtual reality data space called \"the Matrix\".\n* The British 1960s spy/fantasy TV show ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' used [[antagonists]] called Cybernauts. Their nature, however, was merely that of murderous remote-controlled humanoid robots.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Augmented browsing]]\n*[[Artificial intelligence]]\n*[[Autonomy]]\n*[[Computer security]]\n*[[Cyber-HUMINT]]\n*[[Computer security]]\n*[[Cyberwarfare]]\n*[[Cyber security standards]]\n*[[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]]\n*[[Wired glove]]\n*[[Online magazine]]\n*[[Cybersex]]\n*[[Crypto-anarchism]]\n*[[Digital pet]]\n*[[eSports]]\n*[[Global commons]]\n*[[Information superhighway]]\n*[[Infosphere]]\n*[[Internet art]]\n*[[Legal aspects of computing]]\n*[[Real life#Meatspace|Real life]]\n*[[Metaverse]]\n*[[Mixed reality]]\n*[[Multi-agent system]]\n*[[Noosphere]]\n*[[Reality\u2013virtuality continuum]]\n*[[Simulated reality]]\n*[[Social software]]\n*[[Computer program]]\n*[[Sentience]]\n*[[Telepresence]]\n*[[Virtual world]]\n*[[Virtual reality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- see WP:GTL#Standard appendices -->\n*Cyberculture, The key Concepts, edited by David Bell, Brian D.Loader, Nicholas Pleace and Douglas Schuler\n*[[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], \"L\u2019art \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque virtuel\", in Fronti\u00e8res esth\u00e9tiques de l\u2019art, Arts 8, Paris: L\u2019Harmattan, 2004\n*[[William Gibson]].

The Maritimes had a population of 1,813,606 in 2016.<ref>[https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=101&S=50&O=A Population and Dwelling Count Highlight Tables, 2016 Census \u2013 Canada, provinces and territories]</ref> The Maritimes, together with Canada's easternmost province, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], make up the region of [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLocated along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, various aquatic sub-basins are located in the Maritimes, such as the [[Gulf of Maine]] and [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. The region is located northeast of [[New England]], southeast of [[Quebec]]'s [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], and southwest of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The notion of a [[Maritime Union]] has been proposed at various times in Canada's history; the first discussions in 1864 at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] contributed to [[Canadian Confederation]] which instead formed the larger Dominion of Canada. The [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]] and [[Passamaquoddy]] people are indigenous to the Maritimes, while [[Acadian]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] settlements date to the 17th century.\n\n==Name==\n[[Image:Maritimes.png|left|thumb|250px|The Maritimes: New Brunswick (green), Nova Scotia (blue) and Prince Edward Island (red)]]\nThe word [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] is an adjective that simply means \"of the sea\", thus any land associated with the sea can be considered a maritime state or province (all provinces of Canada except Alberta and Saskatchewan border [[sea|the sea]]). Nonetheless, the term \"Maritimes\" has historically been collectively applied to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, all of which border the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In other provinces except [[Newfoundland & Labrador]] and [[British Columbia]] human settlement along the sea is sparse, since the [[Hudson Bay]] area is northerly and has a severe climate, with the majority of the populations of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[Manitoba]] residing far inland.\n\n==History==\nThe [[prehistory of the Canadian Maritimes]] begins after the northerly retreat of glaciers at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] over 10,000 years ago, human settlement by [[First Nations]] began in the Maritimes with [[Paleo-Indians]] during the ''Early Period'', ending around 6,000 years ago.\n\nThe ''Middle Period'', starting 6,000 years ago, and ending 3,000 years ago, was dominated by rising sea levels from the melting glaciers in polar regions. This is also when what is called the ''Laurentian tradition'' started among [[Archaic Indians]], existing First Nations peoples of the time. Evidence of Archaic Indian burial mounds and other ceremonial sites existing in the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] valley has been uncovered.\n\nThe ''Late Period'' extended from 3,000 years ago until first contact with European settlers and was dominated by the organization of First Nations peoples into the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-influenced [[Abenaki]] Nation which existed largely in present-day interior Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, and the Mi'kmaq Nation which inhabited all of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, eastern New Brunswick and the southern Gasp\u00e9. The primarily agrarian [[Maliseet]] Nation settled throughout the Saint John River and [[Allagash River]] valleys of present-day New Brunswick and Maine. The [[Passamaquoddy]] Nation inhabited the northwestern coastal regions of the present-day [[Bay of Fundy]]. The Mi'kmaq Nation is also assumed to have crossed the present-day [[Cabot Strait]] at around this time to settle on the south coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] but were in a minority position compared to the [[Beothuk]] Nation.\n\n===European contact===\nThe Maritimes were the second area in Canada to be settled by Europeans, after Newfoundland. There is evidence that [[Viking]] explorers discovered and settled in the [[Vinland|Vinland region]] around 1000 [[Anno Domini|AD]], which is when the [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] settlement in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has been dated, and it is possible that further exploration was made into the present-day Maritimes and northeastern United States.\n\nBoth [[John Cabot|Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot) and [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] are reported{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to have sailed in or near Maritime waters during their voyages of discovery for [[England]] and [[France]] respectively. Several [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers/cartographers have also documented various parts of the Maritimes, namely [[Diogo Homem]]. However, it was French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] who made the first detailed reconnaissance of the region for a European power, and in so doing, claimed the region for the King of France. Cartier was followed by nobleman [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts]] who was accompanied by explorer/cartographer [[Samuel de Champlain]] in a 1604 expedition where they established the second permanent European settlement in what is now the United States and Canada, following [[Spain]]'s settlement at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. Champlain's settlement at [[Saint Croix Island (Maine)|Saint Croix Island]], later moved to [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port-Royal]], survived where the ill-fated English settlement at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] did not, and pre-dated the more successful English settlement at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] by three years. Champlain went on to greater fame as the founder of [[New France]]'s province of Canada which comprises much of the present-day lower [[St. Lawrence River]] valley in the province of [[Quebec]].\n\n===Acadia===\nChamplain's success in the region, which came to be called ''[[Acadia|Acadie]]'', led to the fertile tidal marshes surrounding the southeastern and northeastern reaches of the [[Bay of Fundy]] being populated by [[French people|French]] immigrants who called themselves ''[[Acadians|Acadien]]''. Acadians eventually built small settlements throughout what is today mainland [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], as well as [[\u00cele-Saint-Jean]] ([[Prince Edward Island]]), [[\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]), and other shorelines of the Gulf of [[St. Lawrence]] in present-day [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Acadian settlements had primarily agrarian economies, although there were many early examples of Acadian fishing settlements in southwestern Nova Scotia and in \u00cele-Royale, as well as along the south and west coasts of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], and the present-day [[C\u00f4te-Nord]] region of Quebec. Most Acadian fishing activities were overshadowed by the comparatively enormous seasonal European fishing fleets based out of Newfoundland which took advantage of proximity to the [[Grand Banks]].\n\nThe growing [[England|English]] colonies along the American seaboard to the south and various European wars between [[England]] and [[France]] during the 17th and 18th centuries brought Acadia to the centre of world-scale geopolitical forces. In 1613, Virginian raiders captured [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port-Royal]], and in 1621 Acadia was ceded to [[Scotland]]'s [[William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]] who renamed it ''Nova Scotia''. By 1632, Acadia was returned from Scotland to [[France]] under the ''[[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]'', and the Port Royale settlement was moved to the site of nearby present-day [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]. More [[French people|French]] settlers, primarily from the [[Vienne]], [[Normandy|Normandie]], and [[Brittany]] regions of [[France]], continued to populate the colony of Acadia during the latter part of the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries. Important settlements also began in the [[Tantramar Marshes|Beaubassin]] region of the present-day [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], and in the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] valley, and settlers began to establish communities on \u00cele-Saint-Jean and \u00cele-Royale as well.\n\nIn 1654, [[New England]] raiders attacked Acadian settlements on the [[Annapolis Basin]], starting a period of uncertainty for Acadians throughout the English constitutional crises under [[Oliver Cromwell]], and only being properly resolved under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667 when France's claim to the region was reaffirmed. Colonial administration by France throughout the history of Acadia was contemptuous at best. France's priorities were in settling and strengthening its claim on [[New France]] and the exploration and settlement of interior [[North America]] and the [[Mississippi River]] valley.\n\n====Colonial wars====\nOver 74 years (1689\u20131763) there were six colonial wars, which involved continuous warfare between New England and [[Acadia]] (see the [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]). Throughout these wars, New England was allied with the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and Acadia was allied with the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. In the first war, [[King William's War]] (the North American theater of the [[Nine Years' War]]), natives from the Maritime region participated in numerous attacks with the French on the Acadia/ New England border in southern Maine (e.g., [[Raid on Salmon Falls]]).  New England retaliatory raids on Acadia, such as the [[Raid on Chignecto (1696)]], were conducted by [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]].  In the second war, [[Queen Anne's War]] (the North American theater of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]), the British conducted the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]], while the region remained primarily in control of [[Military history of the Maliseet people|Maliseet militia]], [[Military history of the Acadians|Acadia militia]] and [[Mi'kmaq militia]].\n\nIn 1719, to further protect strategic interests in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]], France began the 20-year construction of a large [[fortress]] at [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] on \u00cele-Royale. Massachusetts was increasingly concerned over reports of the capabilities of this fortress, and of [[privateer]]s staging out of its harbour to raid New England fishermen on the Grand Banks. In the fourth war, [[King George's War]] (the European theater of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]),  the British engaged successfully in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]]. The British returned control of \u00cele-Royale to France with the fortress virtually intact three years later under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] and the French reestablished their forces there.\n\nIn 1749, to counter the rising threat of Louisbourg, [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] was founded and the [[Royal Navy]] established a major naval base and [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|citadel]]. The founding of Halifax sparked [[Father Le Loutre's War]].\n[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|300px|thumb |right|[[St. John River Campaign]]: Raid on Grimrose (present day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]). This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]]]\n\nDuring the sixth and final colonial war, the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]), the military conflicts in Nova Scotia continued. The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.<ref>John Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia 1710\u20131760.

The Acadians were scattered across the Atlantic, in the Thirteen Colonies, Louisiana, Quebec, Britain and France.

Siege of Louisbourg 1758. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, M55.7.1.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]\nIn 1758, the fortress of [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Louisbourg was laid siege for a second time]] within 15 years, this time by more than 27,000 British soldiers and sailors with over 150 warships. After the French surrender, Louisbourg was thoroughly destroyed by British engineers to ensure it would never be reclaimed. With the fall of Louisbourg, French and Mi'kmaq resistance in the region crumbled. British forces seized remaining French control over Acadia in the coming months, with \u00cele-Saint-Jean falling in 1759 to British forces on their way to Quebec City for the Siege of Quebec and ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham.\n\nThe war ended and Britain had gained control over the entire Maritime region and the Indigenous people signed the [[Halifax Treaties]].\n\n===American Revolution===\nFollowing the [[Seven Years' War]], empty Acadian lands were settled first by [[New England Planters]] and then by immigrants brought from [[Yorkshire Emigration to Nova Scotia|Yorkshire]]. \u00cele-Royale was renamed Cape Breton Island and incorporated into the Colony of Nova Scotia.\n\nBoth the colonies of Nova Scotia (present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and St. John's Island (Prince Edward Island) were affected by the [[American Revolutionary War]], largely by privateering against American shipping, but several coastal communities were also the targets of American raiders. Charlottetown, the capital of the new colony of St. John's Island, was ransacked in 1775 with the provincial secretary kidnapped and the Great Seal stolen. The largest military action in the Maritimes during the revolutionary war was the attack on [[Battle of Fort Cumberland|Fort Cumberland]] (the renamed [[Fort Beausejour]]) in 1776 by a force of American sympathizers led by [[Jonathan Eddy]]. The fort was partially overrun after a month-long siege, but the attackers were ultimately repelled after the arrival of British reinforcements from Halifax.\n\nThe most significant impact from this war was the settling of large numbers of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees in the region, especially in Shelburne and Parrtown (Saint John). Following the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, Loyalist settlers in what would become New Brunswick persuaded British administrators to split the Colony of Nova Scotia to create the new colony of New Brunswick in 1784. At the same time, another part of the Colony of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, was split off to become the Colony of Cape Breton Island.\nThe Colony of St. John's Island was renamed to [[Prince Edward Island]] on November 29, 1798.\n\nThe [[War of 1812]] had some effect on the shipping industry in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton Island; however, the significant [[Royal Navy]] presence in Halifax and other ports in the region prevented any serious attempts by American raiders. Maritime and American [[privateer]]s targeted unprotected shipping of both the United States and Britain respectively, further reducing trade. New Brunswick's section of the Canada\u2013US border did not have any significant action during this conflict, although British forces did occupy a portion of coastal [[Maine]] at one point. The most significant incident from this war which occurred in the Maritimes was the British capture and detention of the American [[frigate]] [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] in Halifax.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1820, the Colony of [[Cape Breton Island]] was merged back into the Colony of Nova Scotia for the second time by the British government.\n\nBritish settlement of the Maritimes, as the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island came to be known, accelerated throughout the late 18th century and into the 19th century with significant immigration to the region as a result of [[Scotland|Scottish]] migrants displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]] and [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] escaping the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845\u20131849)]]. As a result, significant portions of the three provinces are influenced by [[Celt]]ic heritages, with [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] (and to a lesser degree, [[Irish Gaelic language|Irish Gaelic]]) having been widely spoken, particularly in Cape Breton, although it is less prevalent today.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], a significant number of Maritimers volunteered to fight for the armies of the Union, while a small handful joined the Confederate Army. However, the majority of the conflict's impact was felt in the shipping industry. Maritime shipping boomed during the war due to large-scale Northern imports of war supplies which were often carried by Maritime ships as Union ships were vulnerable to Confederate naval raiders.  Diplomatic tensions between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[U.S. Northern states|Unionist North]] had deteriorated after some interests in Britain expressed support for the secessionist [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]]. The Union navy, although much smaller than the British [[Royal Navy]] and no threat to the Maritimes, did posture off Maritime coasts at times chasing Confederate naval ships which sought repairs and reprovisioning in Maritime ports, especially Halifax.\n  {{multiple image\n   | width     = 140\n   | footer    = Joseph Howe and Charles Tupper competed politically on the question of confederation\n   | image1    = Sir charles tupper.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Charles Tupper \n   | image2    = Joseph Howe.jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Joseph Howe\n  }}\nThe immense size of the Union army (the largest on the planet toward the end of the Civil War), however, was viewed with increasing concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of [[Fenian]] raids on border communities in [[New Brunswick]] by those seeking to end British rule of [[Ireland]]. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on [[Maritime Union]], to be held in early September 1864 in Charlottetown \u2013 chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance to give up its jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, they might be able to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]], as it came to be called, was also attended by a slew of visiting delegates from the neighbouring colony of [[United Province of Canada|Canada]], who had largely arrived at their own invitation with their own agenda. This agenda saw the conference dominated by discussions of creating an even larger union of the entire territory of [[British North America]] into a united colony. The Charlottetown Conference ended with an agreement to meet the following month in [[Quebec City]], where more formal discussions ensued, culminating with meetings in [[London]] and the signing of the [[British North America Act]]. Of the Maritime provinces, only Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were initially party to the BNA Act, Prince Edward Island's reluctance, combined with a booming agricultural and fishing export economy having led to that colony opting not to sign on.\n\n==Major population centres==\n{{Main|List of municipalities in Nova Scotia|List of cities in New Brunswick|List of municipalities in Prince Edward Island}}\n\nThe major communities of the region include [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Cape Breton]] in Nova Scotia, [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[Fredericton]] and [[Moncton]] in New Brunswick, and [[Charlottetown]] in Prince Edward Island.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Maritimes K\u00f6ppen.svg|300px|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of the Maritimes]]\nIn spite of its name, The Maritimes has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm-summer subtype. Especially in coastal Nova Scotia, differences between summers and winters are pretty narrow compared with most of Canada. The inland climate of New Brunswick is in stark contrast during winter, resembling more continental areas. Summers are somewhat tempered by the marine influence throughout the provinces, but due to the southerly parallels still remain similar to more continental areas further west. [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] in Nova Scotia has significant marine influence to have a borderline [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] [[microclimate]], but winter nights are still cold even in all coastal areas. The northernmost areas of New Brunswick are only just above [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] with very cold continental winters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected locations in The Maritimes<ref name=\"Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010\">{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html?#1981|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!Location\n!Province\n!July (\u00b0C)\n!July (\u00b0F)\n!January (\u00b0C)\n!January (\u00b0F)\n|-\n|[[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] || NS || 23/14 || 73/58 || 0/\u22128 || 32/17\n|-\n|[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] || NS || 23/12 || 73/54 || \u22121/\u22129 || 30/14\n|-\n|[[Fredericton, New Brunswick|Fredericton]] || NB || 25/13 || 78/55 || \u22124/\u221215 || 25/5\n|-\n|[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] || NB || 22/11 || 72/53 || \u22122/\u221213 || 27/8\n|-\n|[[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]] || NB || 24/13 || 76/53 || \u20133/\u201314 || 25/7\n|-\n|[[Charlottetown]] || PEI || 23/14 || 74/57 || \u20133/\u221212 || 26/10\n|-\n|[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] || NS || 21/12 || 69/55 || 1/\u22127 || 33/19\n|-\n|[[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]] || NB || 23/10 || 74/51 || \u20139/\u201320 || 16/\u20134\n|}\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[Image:Provinces maritimes langues.png|thumb|Map showing the mother tongue of people in the Maritimes.

Predominantly rural until recent decades, the region traces many of its cultural activities to those rural resource-based economies of [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[coal mining]].\n\nWhile Maritimers are predominantly of west European heritage ([[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Ireland|Irish]], [[England|English]], and [[Acadians|Acadian]]), immigration to [[Industrial Cape Breton]] during the heyday of coal mining and steel manufacturing brought people from eastern Europe as well as from Newfoundland. The Maritimes also have a [[Black Canadians|black]] population who are mostly descendants of [[African American]] [[Black Loyalists|loyalists]] or [[Black Refugee (War of 1812)|refugees from the War of 1812]], largely [[Black Nova Scotians|concentrated in Nova Scotia]] but also in various communities throughout southern New Brunswick, Cape Breton (where the black population is largely of [[West Indian]] descent), and Prince Edward Island. The Mi'kmaq Nation's reserves throughout Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and eastern New Brunswick dominate aboriginal culture in the region, compared to the much smaller population of the [[Maliseet|Maliseet Nation]] in western New Brunswick.  New Brunswick, in general, differs from the other two Maritime Provinces in that its French population plays a significant role in the everyday cultural experience.  Being the only officially bilingual province in Canada, many of New Brunswick's inhabitants speak both French and English, especially in Moncton and the capital region of Fredericton.\n\n[[Image:Sjnb-skyline.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Skyline of Saint John, New Brunswick as of Summer 2002]]\nCultural activities are fairly diverse throughout the region, with the music, dance, theatre, and literary art forms tending to follow the particular cultural heritage of specific locales. Notable Nova Scotian folklorist and cultural historian [[Helen Creighton]] spent the majority of her lifetime recording the various [[Celtic music]]al and folk traditions of rural Nova Scotia during the mid-20th century, prior to this knowledge being wiped out by mass media assimilation with the rest of North America. A fragment of [[Gaelic culture]] remains in Nova Scotia, specifically on Cape Breton Island.  PEI and New Brunswick share this historical tie to Gaelic culture with Nova Scotia but it plays a far less significant role in their respective public provincial images.\n\n[[Image:Monctonskyline 857.png|thumb|left|Skyline of Moncton, New Brunswick|300px]]\nCanada has witnessed a \"Celtic revival\" in which many Maritime musicians and songs have risen to prominence in recent decades. Some companies, particularly breweries such as [[Alexander Keith's]] and [[Moosehead Brewery|Moosehead]] have played up a connection between folklore with alcohol consumption during their marketing campaigns. The Maritimes were among the strongest supporters of [[prohibition]] (Prince Edward Island lasting until 1949), and some predominantly rural communities maintain \"dry\" status, banning the retail sale of alcohol as a vestige of the original temperance movement in the region.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Present status===\n[[Image:Fredericton City Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fredericton City Hall]]\nGiven the small population of the region (compared with the Central Canadian provinces or the New England states), the regional economy is a net exporter of natural resources, manufactured goods, and services. The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialization in the second half of the 19th century brought steel to [[Trenton, Nova Scotia]], and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the Maritime regional economy has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.\n\nImportant manufacturing centres in the region include [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]], [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]], the [[Annapolis Valley]] and the [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]], and the [[Strait of Canso]] area in Nova Scotia, as well as [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]] in Prince Edward Island, and the [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] area, the [[North Shore (New Brunswick)|North Shore]] and the upper [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] valley of New Brunswick.\n\nSome predominantly coastal areas have become major tourist centres, such as parts of Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton Island, the South Shore of Nova Scotia and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[Bay of Fundy]] coasts of New Brunswick. Additional service-related industries in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[insurance]] and [[financial]] sectors\u2014as well as [[research]]-related spin-offs from the region's numerous universities and colleges\u2014are significant economic contributors.\n\nAnother important contribution to Nova Scotia's provincial economy is through spin-offs and royalties relating to off-shore [[petroleum]] exploration and development. Mostly concentrated on the continental shelf of the province's Atlantic coast in the vicinity of [[Sable Island, Nova Scotia|Sable Island]], exploration activities began in the 1960s and resulted in the first commercial production field for oil beginning in the 1980s. [[Natural gas]] was also discovered in the 1980s during exploration work, and this is being commercially recovered, beginning in the late 1990s. Initial optimism in Nova Scotia about the potential of off-shore resources appears to have diminished with the lack of new discoveries, although exploration work continues and is moving farther off-shore into waters on the [[continental margin]].\n\n[[Image:Charlottetown quay.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Peakes Quay on the [[Charlottetown]] waterfront]]\nRegional transportation networks have also changed significantly in recent decades with port modernizations, with new [[freeway]] and ongoing arterial highway construction, the abandonment of various low-capacity [[railway]] [[branchline]]s (including the entire railway system of Prince Edward Island and southwestern Nova Scotia), and the construction of the [[Canso Causeway]] and the [[Confederation Bridge]]. There have been airport improvements at various centres providing improved connections to markets and destinations in the rest of North America and overseas.\n\nImprovements in infrastructure and the regional economy notwithstanding, the three provinces remain one of the poorer regions of Canada. While urban areas are growing and thriving, economic adjustments have been harsh in rural and resource-dependent communities, and emigration has been an ongoing phenomenon for some parts of the region. Another problem is seen in the lower average wages and family incomes within the region. Property values are depressed, resulting in a smaller tax base for these three provinces, particularly when compared with the national average which benefits from central and western Canadian economic growth.\n\nThis has been particularly problematic with the growth of the [[welfare state]] in Canada since the 1950s, resulting in the need to draw upon [[equalization payments]] to provide nationally mandated social services. Since the 1990s the region has experienced an exceptionally tumultuous period in its regional economy with the collapse of large portions of the ground fishery throughout Atlantic Canada, the closing of coal mines and a steel mill on [[Cape Breton Island]], and the closure of military bases in all three provinces.  That being said, New Brunswick has one of the largest military bases in the British Commonwealth (CFB Gagetown), which plays a significant role in the cultural and economic spheres of Fredericton, the province's capital city.\n\n===Historical===\n\n====Growth====\n[[Image:CharlottetownConference1864.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]]]]\nWhile the economic underperformance of the Maritime economy has been long lasting, it has not always been present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a \"Golden Age\" in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of [[British North America]]'s most extensive manufacturing sectors as well as a large international shipping industry. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one to the study of the region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after [[free trade]] with the United States (in the form of the [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement|Reciprocity Agreement]]) had ended. In the 1870s [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[National Policy]] was implemented, creating a system of protective [[tariffs]] around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.\n[[Image:SamuelCunard.jpg|thumb|left|Maritime-born shipping magnate [[Samuel Cunard|Sir Samuel Cunard]]]]\n\n====Reputed Golden Age====\nSeveral scholars have explored the so-called \"golden age\" of the Maritimes in the years just before Confederation. In [[History of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]], the population grew steadily from 277,000 in 1851 to 388,000 in 1871, mostly from natural increase since immigration was slight. The era has been called a golden age, but that was a myth created in the 1930s to lure tourists to a romantic era of tall ships and antiques.<ref>Ian McKay, \"History and the Tourist Gaze: The Politics of Commemoration in Nova Scotia, 1935\u20131964,\" ''Acadiensis,'' Spring 1993, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 102\u2013138</ref> Recent historians using census data have shown that is a fallacy. In 1851\u20131871 there was an overall increase in per capita wealth holding. However most of the gains went to the urban elite class, especially businessmen and financiers living in Halifax. The wealth held by the top 10% rose considerably over the two decades, but there was little improvement in the wealth levels in rural areas, which comprised the great majority of the population.<ref>Julian Gwyn and Fazley Siddiq, \"Wealth distribution in Nova Scotia during the Confederation era, 1851 and 1871,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' Dec 1992, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 435\u201352</ref> Likewise Gwyn reports that gentlemen, merchants, bankers, colliery owners, shipowners, shipbuilders, and master mariners flourished. However the great majority of families were headed by farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and laborers. Most of them\u2014and many widows as well\u2014lived in poverty. Out migration became an increasingly necessary option.<ref>Julian Gwyn, \"Golden Age or Bronze Moment? Wealth and Poverty in Nova Scotia: The 1850s and 1860s,\" ''Canadian Papers in Rural History,'' 1992, Vol. 8, pp 195\u2013230</ref><ref>Rural poverty is the theme of Rusty Bittermann, Robert A. Mackinnon, and Graeme Wynn, \"Of inequality and interdependence in the Nova Scotian countryside, 1850\u201370,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' March 1993, Vol. 74 Issue 1, pp 1\u201343</ref> Thus the era was indeed a golden age but only for a small but powerful and highly visible elite.\n\n====Economic decline====\nThe cause of economic malaise in the Maritimes is an issue of great debate and controversy among historians, economists, and geographers. The differing opinions can approximately be divided into the \"structuralists,\" who argue that poor policy decisions are to blame, and the others, who argue that unavoidable technological and geographical factors caused the decline.\n\nThe exact date that the Maritimes began to fall behind the rest of Canada is difficult to determine. Historian Kris Inwood places the date very early, at least in Nova Scotia, finding clear signs that the Maritimes \"Golden Age\" of the mid-19th century was over by 1870, before Confederation or the National Policy could have had any significant impact. Richard Caves places the date closer to 1885. T.W. Acheson takes a similar view and provides considerable evidence that the early 1880s were in fact a booming period in Nova Scotia and this growth was only undermined towards the end of that decade. David Alexander argues that any earlier declines were simply part of the global [[Long Depression]], and that the Maritimes first fell behind the rest of Canada when the great boom period of the early 20th century had little effect on the region. E.R. Forbes, however, emphasizes that the precipitous decline did not occur until after the [[World War I|First World War]] during the 1920s when new railway policies were implemented. Forbes also contends that significant Canadian defence spending during the [[World War II|Second World War]] favoured powerful political interests in Central Canada such as [[C.D. Howe]], when major Maritime shipyards and factories, as well as Canada's largest steel mill, located in Cape Breton Island, fared poorly.\n\n[[Image:Yarmouth N.S 1910.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] in 1910]]\nOne of the most important changes, and one that almost certainly had an effect, was the revolution in transportation that occurred at this time. The Maritimes were connected to central Canada by the [[Intercolonial Railway]] in the 1870s, removing a longstanding barrier to trade. For the first time this placed the Maritime manufacturers in direct competition with those of Central Canada. Maritime trading patterns shifted considerably from mainly trading with [[New England]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[Caribbean]], to being focused on commerce with the Canadian interior, enforced by the federal government's tariff policies.\n\nCoincident with the construction of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel [[steam ship]]s. The Maritimes had long been a centre for [[shipbuilding]], and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like [[New York City|New York]] and [[Montreal]]. Even the [[Cunard Line]], founded by Maritime-born [[Samuel Cunard]], stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.\n[[File:MarysvillePlaceMarysvilleNB2014.jpg|thumb|left|Major factories like this cotton mill in Marysville, near Fredericton, failed to compete with more centralized operations in Quebec and Ontario]]\nMore controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the [[Maritime Rights Movement]] of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson is one of the main proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Corner of princess and the Water Street in Saint John NB New-Brunwick.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Princess and Water Street in Saint John]] -->\nThe policies in the early years of Confederation were designed by Central Canadian interests, and they reflected the needs of that region. The unified Canadian market and the introduction of railroads created a relative weakness in the Maritime economies. Central to this concept, according to Acheson, was the lack of metropolises in the Maritimes.\n\nMontreal and [[Toronto]] were well suited to benefit from the development of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]], these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], but a contracting population in industrial [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], and several smaller centres in [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]], [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], and [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]]. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]]. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.\n\nDespite the region's absence of economic growth on the same scale as other parts of the nation, the Maritimes has changed markedly throughout the 20th century, partly as a result of global and national economic trends, and partly as a result of government intervention. Each sub-region within the Maritimes has developed over time to exploit different resources and expertise. Saint John became a centre of the timber trade and shipbuilding and is currently a centre for oil refining and some manufacturing. The northern New Brunswick communities of [[Edmundston]], [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]], [[Dalhousie, New Brunswick|Dalhousie]], [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], and [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] are focused on the pulp and paper industry and some mining activity. Moncton was a centre for railways and has changed its focus to becoming a multi-modal transportation centre with associated manufacturing and retail interests. The Halifax metropolitan area has come to dominate peninsular Nova Scotia as a retail and service centre, but that province's industries were spread out from the coal and steel industries of industrial [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] and [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou]] counties, the mixed farming of the North Shore and Annapolis Valley, and the fishing industry was primarily focused on the South Shore and [[Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia)|Eastern Shore]]. Prince Edward Island is largely dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism.\n\nGiven the geographic diversity of the various sub-regions within the Maritimes, policies to centralize the population and economy were not initially successful, thus Maritime factories closed while those in Ontario and Quebec prospered.\n\nThe traditional [[staples thesis]], advocated by scholars such as S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues that it was the decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and looks at a number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. He repeats Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant [[hydro-electric power]], key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.\n\nThe Maritimes are the only provinces in Canada which entered Confederation in the 19th century and have kept their original colonial boundaries. All three provinces have the smallest land base in the country and have been forced to make do with resources within. By comparison, the former colony of the [[United Province of Canada]] (divided into the District of [[Canada East]], and the District of [[Canada West]]) and the western provinces were dozens of times larger and in some cases were expanded to take in territory formerly held in British Crown grants to companies such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]; in particular the November 19, 1869 sale of [[Rupert's Land]] to the Government of Canada under the ''[[Rupert's Land Act 1868]]'' was facilitated in part by Maritime taxpayers.  The economic riches of energy and natural resources held within this larger land base were only realized by other provinces during the 20th century.\n\n==Industries==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}} \nThe maritime provinces' main industry is fishing. Fishing can be found in any maritime province. This includes fishing for lobster, mackerel, tuna, salmon and many more kinds of fish. Oysters and salmonid aquiculture is also increasingly important economically.\n\n[[File:Halifax Shipyard June 2015 wide.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Halifax Shipyard]]\n\n===Nova Scotia===\nNova Scotia is very strong in agriculture, forestry and fishing.\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\nTourism is important to the economy of PEI. ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' was written in PEI. Because of this, every year it attracts families to see where the beloved story was based, and in the summers, to enjoy beaches and sunlight. PEI is also known for its agriculture, mainly the potato, and fishing industries.\n\n===New Brunswick===\n[[File:Amber Skies.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Pulp and paper mill in new Brunswick]]\nAgriculture and forestry are two prominent industries found in New Brunswick.  Despite having an extensive coastline, New Brunswick's industrial sector has never been entirely reliant on the success of the fisheries.  Likewise, the strong shipbuilding heritage of the province directly relates to its forest resources.  Because of this, New Brunswickers tend to attribute their cultural heritage less with the sea and more with their forests and rivers.\n\n==Politics==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}\n\nMaritime conservatism since the Second World War has been very much part of the [[Red Tory]] tradition, key influences being former [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] and federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] and New Brunswick Tory strategist [[Dalton Camp]].\n\nIn recent years, the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has made significant inroads both federally and provincially in the region. The NDP has elected [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from New Brunswick, but most of the focus of the party at the federal and provincial levels is currently in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia. Industrial Cape Breton has historically been a region of labour activism, electing [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (and later NDP) MPs, and even produced many early members of the [[Communist Party of Canada]] in the pre-[[World War II]] era. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the NDP captured 28.45% of the vote in Nova Scotia, more than any other province.  In the [[Nova Scotia general election, 2009|2009 provincial election]] the NDP formed a majority government, the first in the region.\n\nThe Maritimes are generally [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] but unlike [[Alberta]], they also have fiscally [[socialism|socialist]] tendencies. It is because of the lack of support for [[fiscal conservatism]] that federal parties such as the [[Canadian Alliance]] never had much success in the region,  In the 2004 federal election, the Conservatives had one of the worst showings in the region for a right-wing party, going back to Confederation, with the exception of the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]]. The Conservative party improved its seat count in the 2008 and elected 13 MPs in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]]. However, in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 election]] the Liberal Party won every seat in the region, defeating all of the Conservative (and NDP) challengers.\n\nAn area within the region where both fiscal and social conservatism coincide and where the federal [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and Canadian Alliance had some success is in central-western part of New Brunswick, in the Saint John River valley north of Saint John and south of [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls]]. Contributing demographics include a predominantly [[English language|Anglophone]] population residing in a largely rural agrarian setting. One influence might be proximity to the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]] and the state of [[Maine]]. The valley is also settled by descendants of [[United Empire Loyalists]] whose influence continues in the area. There are also a large number of active and retired military personnel located in the Fredericton and [[Oromocto, New Brunswick|Oromocto]] area as a result of the large military base at [[CFB Gagetown]]. Another area in the region with smatterings of coinciding fiscal and social conservatism is the [[Annapolis Valley]] of Nova Scotia.\n\nThe [[Liberal Party of Canada]] has done well in the Maritimes in the past because of its [[Keynesian economics|interventionist]] policies. The Acadian Peninsula region of New Brunswick, long dependent upon seasonal employment in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] fishery, tends to vote for the Liberals or NDP for this reason. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s Liberals endured a bitter defeat to the PCs and NDP in many ridings as a result of unpopular cuts to [[unemployment benefit]]s for seasonal workers, as well as closures of several [[Canadian Forces Base]]s, the refusal to honour a promise to rescind the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], cutbacks to provincial [[equalization payments]], [[health care]], [[post-secondary education]] and regional transportation infrastructure such as [[airports]], fishing [[harbour]]s, [[seaport]]s, and [[rail transport|railways]]. The Liberals held onto seats in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, while being shut out of Nova Scotia entirely, the second time in history (the only other time being the [[Canadian federal election, 1958|Diefenbaker sweep]]). In 2015 the Liberals won every seat in The Maritimes, defeating Conservative and NDP incumbents.\n\nThe Maritimes is currently represented in the Canadian Parliament by 25 Members of the House of Commons (Nova Scotia \u2013 11, New Brunswick \u2013 10, Prince Edward Island \u2013 4) and 24 Senators (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick \u2013 10 each, Prince Edward Island \u2013 4). This level of representation was established at the time of Confederation when the Maritimes had a much larger proportion of the national population. The comparatively large population growth of western and central Canada during the immigration boom of the 20th century has reduced the Maritimes' proportion of the national population to less than 10%, resulting in an over-representation in Parliament, with some federal ridings having fewer than 35,000 people, compared to central and western Canada where ridings typically contain 100,000\u2013120,000 people.\n\nThe [[Senate of Canada]] is structured along regional lines, giving an equal number of seats (24) to the Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, and western Canada, in addition to the later entry of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the three territories. Enshrined in the [[Canadian Constitution|Constitution]], this model was developed to ensure that no area of the country is able to exert undue influence in the Senate. The Maritimes, with its much smaller proportion of the national population (compared to the time of Confederation) also have an over-representation in the Senate, particularly compared to the population growth of Ontario and the western provinces. This has led to [[Triple-E Senate|calls to reform the Senate]]; however, such a move would entail constitutional changes.\n\nAnother factor related to the number of Senate seats is that a constitutional amendment in the early 20th century mandated that no province can have fewer Members of Parliament than it has senators. This court decision resulted from a complaint by the Government of Prince Edward Island after that province's number of MPs was proposed to change from 4 to 3, accounting for its declining proportion of the national population at that time. When PEI entered Confederation in 1873, it was accorded 6 MPs and 4 Senators; however this was reduced to 4 MPs by the early 20th century. Senators being appointed for life at this time, these coveted seats rarely went unfilled for a long period of time anywhere in Canada. As a result, PEI's challenge was accepted by the federal government, and its level of federal representation was secured. In the aftermath of the 1989 budget, which saw a fillibuster by Liberal Senators in attempt to kill legislation creating the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] \"stacked\" the Senate by creating additional seats in several provinces across Canada, including New Brunswick; however, there was no attempt by these provinces to increase the number of MPs to reflect this change in Senate representation.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography of Canada}}\n{{Commons category|Maritimes}}\n*[[Atlantic Canada]]\n* [[Acadiensis]], scholarly history journal covering Atlantic Canada\n*[[Central Canada]]\n*[[List of regions of Canada]]\n*[[Maritime Film Classification Board]]\n*[[Maritime Union]]\n*[[New England]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Maritimes}}\n*[http://www.apec-econ.ca Atlantic Provinces Economic Council]\n*[http://www.aims.ca Atlantic Institute of Market Studies]\n*[http://www.gpiatlantic.org Genuine Progress Indicator Atlantic]\n*[http://atlanticportal.hil.unb.ca/ Atlantic Canada Portal/Portail du Canada Atlantique]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Canada topics}}\n{{Regions of the world}}\n\n{{coord|46|N|64|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maritimes}}\n[[Category:Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:The Maritimes| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of Canada]]\n[[Category:Atlantic Canada]]", "sha1": "25bv78wqne7rbdu1isyn4f3bljhfvp8"}}, {"title": "Cyril of Alexandria", "ns": "0", "id": "7383", "revision": {"id": "865912929", "parentid": "865874208", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T00:37:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "David Eppstein", "id": "2051880"}, "comment": "[[Maria Dzielska]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{otherpeople||Pope Cyril of Alexandria (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox saint\n|name=Saint Cyril of Alexandria\n|birth_date={{circa}} 376\n|birth_place=Didouseya, [[Roman Egypt]]<br><small>(modern-day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]])</small>\n|death_date={{death year and age|444|376}}\n|death_place=[[Alexandria]]\n|venerated_in=[[Roman Catholic Church]]<br>[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]<br>[[Oriental Orthodoxy]]<br>[[Eastern Catholic Churches]]<br>[[Anglicanism]]<br>[[Lutheranism]]\n|feast_day=18 January and 9 June ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]])<br>27 June ([[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]])<br> 9 February ([[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]], ''formerly'' Roman Catholic Church, 1882\u20131969)\n|image= Rousanu16.jpg\n|imagesize= 225px\n|caption=''St Cyril of Alexandria, Patriarch, Confessor, and Doctor of the Catholic Church''\n|titles=The Pillar of Faith; Bishop, Confessor, and Doctor of the Church\n|beatified_date= \n|beatified_place= \n|beatified_by= \n|canonized_date= \n|canonized_place= \n|canonized_by= \n|attributes=Vested as a [[Bishop]] with [[phelonion]] and [[omophorion]], and usually with his head covered in the manner of Egyptian monastics (sometimes the head covering has a ''polystavrion'' pattern), he usually is depicted holding a [[Gospel Book]] or a [[scroll]], with his right hand raised in blessing. \n|patronage= [[Alexandria]]\n|major_shrine= \n|suppressed_date= \n|issues=[[Christology]]<br>[[Mariology]]<br>Lynching of [[Hypatia]]<br>Separation of Church & State\n|prayer= \n|prayer_attrib= \n}}\n{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=figures}}\n{{Oriental Orthodox sidebar}}\n'''Cyril of Alexandria''' ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}; {{lang-cop|\u2ca0\u2c81\u2ca1\u2c81 \u2c94\u2ca9\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c97\u2c97\u2c9f\u2ca9 \u2c81\u0305 also \u2ca1\u2c93\u0300\u2c81\u2c85\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5 \u2c94\u2c93\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c97\u2c97\u2c9f\u2ca5}}; c. 376 \u2013 444) was the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] from 412 to 444. He was enthroned when the city was at the height of its influence and power within the [[Roman Empire]]. Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the [[Christological controversies]] of the late-4th and 5th centuries. He was a central figure in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, which led to the deposition of [[Nestorius]] as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nCyril is counted among the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[Doctors of the Church]], and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles ''Pillar of Faith'' and ''Seal of all the Fathers'', but [[Theodosius II]], the [[Roman Emperor]], condemned him for behaving like a \"proud pharaoh\", and the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] bishops at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] declared him a heretic, labelling him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church.\"<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47.</ref>\n\nCyril is well-known due to his dispute with Nestorius and his supporter Patriarch [[John of Antioch]], whom Cyril excluded from the Council of Ephesus for arriving late. He is also known for his expulsion of [[Novatianism|Novatians]] and Jews from Alexandria and for inflaming tensions that led to the murder of the [[hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosopher]] [[Hypatia]] by a Christian mob. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility in this. \n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. This date is used by the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]]. Yet the 1969 Catholic Calendar revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice, 1969), pp. 95 and 116.</ref> The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Catholic|Catholic]] Churches celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria]], on 18 January.\n\n==Early life==\nLittle is known for certain of Cyril's early life. He was born c. 376, in the small town of Didouseya, Egypt, modern-day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Norman Russell|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EmeFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=didouseya#v=onepage&q=didouseya&f=false|title=Cyril of Alexandria: The Early Church Fathers|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=204|isbn=9781134673377}}</ref> A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] rose to the powerful position of [[Patriarch of Alexandria]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-280058-9|pages=125|edition=4.}}</ref>  His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]. He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390\u2013392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393\u2013397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398\u2013402). \n\nIn 403 he accompanied his uncle to attend the \"[[Synod of the Oak]]\" in Constantinople,<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.11.xvii.htm Schaff, Philip. \"Cyril of Alexandria\"], ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. III.</ref> that deposed [[John Chrysostom]] as Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-cyril-of-alexandria/ \"Saint Cyril of Alexandria\", Franciscan Media]</ref> The prior year, Theophilus had been summoned by the emperor to [[Constantinople]] to apologize before a [[synod]], over which Chrysostom would preside, on account of several charges which were brought against him by certain Egyptian monks. Theophilus, had them persecuted as [[Origen of Alexandria|Origenists]].<ref>[[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], ''Dialogus'', xvi; [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VI, 7; [[Sozomen]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VIII, 12.</ref> Placing himself at the head of soldiers and armed servants Theophilus had marched against the monks, burned their dwellings, and ill-treated those whom he captured.<ref>Chrysostom Baur (1912), [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14625b.htm \"Theophilus], ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Vol. XIV (New York: Robert Appleton Company)</ref> Theophilus arrived at Constantinople with twenty-nine of his suffragan bishops, and conferring with those opposed to the Archbishop, drafted a long list of largely unfounded accusations against Chrysostom, <ref>[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', 59, in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', CIII, 105-113</ref> who refused to recognize the legality of a synod in which his open enemies were judges. Chrysostom was subsequently deposed.\n\n===Patriarch of Alexandria===\nTheophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope (word)|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, but only after a riot between his supporters and those of his rival Archdeacon Timotheus. According to [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], the Alexandrians were always rioting.<ref name=Chapman>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04592b.htm Chapman, John. \"St. Cyril of Alexandria.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 June 2016</ref> \n\nThus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants.<ref name=\"library\">Preston Chesser, {{cite web | title=The Burning of the Library of Alexandria | url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=9}}, eHistory.com</ref> He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatianism|Novatianists]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.\n\n====Dispute with the Prefect====\n[[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}} \n\nTension between the parties increased when in 415, Orestes published an edict that outlined new regulations regarding mime shows and dancing exhibitions in the city, which attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees. Crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater. Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to discover the content of the edict. The edict angered Christians as well as Jews. At one such gathering, Hierax, read the edict and applauded the new regulations, prompting a disturbance. Many people felt that Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd into sedition.<ref>John of Nikiu, 84.92.</ref> Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: the first was to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13.6-9</ref>{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}} \n\nSocrates Scholasticus recounts that upon hearing of Hierex's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with \"the utmost severities\" if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately. In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians. They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire. When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, \"the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them\" by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight. When the morning came, the Jews of Alexandria could not hide their guilt, and Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city\u2019s synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre.<ref name=Scholasticus>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', born after 380 AD, died after 439 AD.</ref>\n\nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus, after Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria, he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria. Scholasticus indicates that all the Jews were banished, while [[John of Niki\u00fb]] says only those involved in the ambush. Susan Wessel says that while it is not clear whether Scholasticus was a Novationist, (whose churches Cyril had closed), he was apparently sympathetic towards them, and makes clear Cyril's habit of abusing his episcopal power by infringing on the rights and duties of the secular authorities. Wessel says \"...Socrates probably does not provide accurate and unambiguous information about Cyril's relationship to imperial authority.{{sfn|Wessel p. 22}} \n\nNonetheless, with Cyril's banishment of the Jews, however many, \"Orestes [...] was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population.\"<ref name=Scholasticus /> Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation. Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, showed him the Gospels, which he interpreted to indicate that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy.<ref name=\"wessel35\">Wessel, p. 35</ref> Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures.\n\nThis refusal almost cost Orestes his life. [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks' had resorted to violence 15 years before, during a controversy between Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) and the \"[[Tall Brothers]]\"; The monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. A monk named [[Ammonius (monk)|Ammonius]], threw a stone hitting Orestes in the head. The prefect had Ammonius tortured to death, whereupon the Patriarch honored him as a martyr. However, according to Scholasticus, the Christian community displayed a general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom. The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], as did Cyril.<ref name=\"ss7_14\">Socrates Scholasticus, vii.14.</ref><ref>Wessel, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n====Lynching of Hypatia====\n{{Main|Hypatia}}\nPrefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable [[moral authority]] in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. At the time of her death, she was likely over sixty years of age. Indeed, many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the Pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, in order to better manage the tumultuous political life of the Egyptian capital.<ref>Christopher Haas, ''Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict'', JHU Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8018-8541-8}}, p. 312.</ref> A mob, led by a [[lector]] named Peter, took Hypatia from her chariot and murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.<ref name=\"ss7_15\">Socrate Scolastico, vii.15.</ref><ref>Giovanni di Nikiu, 84.88-100.</ref> \n\nNeoplatonist historian [[Damascius]] (c. 458 \u2013 c. 538) was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers.<ref>[http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/issues/v06n1/4whitfield.pdf Whitfield, Bryan J., \"The Beauty of Reasoning: A Reexamination of Hypatia and Alexandria\", ''The Mathematics Educator'', vol. 6, issue 1, p.14, University of Georgia, Summer 1995]</ref> Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril.{{sfn|Dzielska|1996|p=18}} Some modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril.<ref>[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Hypatia of Alexandria'', Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1995 (Revealing Antiquity, 8), p. xi, 157. {{ISBN|0-674-43775-6}}</ref> According to lexicographer [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], \"She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril.\"<ref>http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html{{dead link|date=June 2016}}</ref>  Scholasticus writes that Hypatia ultimately fell \"victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed\". News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denouncement, not only against Cyril but against the whole Alexandrian Christian community.\n\n====Conflict with Nestorius====\nAnother major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the [[First Council of Constantinople#Dispute concerning the third canon|third canon of the First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>Leo Donald Davis, ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology'', Collegeville (Min.): The Liturgical Press, 1983, pp. 136-148. {{ISBN|0-8146-5616-1}}</ref>\n\nCyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the \"Mother of God\" (''[[Theotokos]]''). As the term \"Mother of God\" had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a \"Mother of Man\" nor \"[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]\" as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the \"Mother of Christ\" (Greek: ''[[Christotokos]]''). Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his \"temple\" (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered \"in the flesh.\"<ref>Thomas Gerard Weinandy, Daniel A. Keating, ''The theology of St. Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York: T&T Clark Ltd, 2003, p. 49.</ref> However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh.<ref>Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril {{cite web|url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065600/https://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary. The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy.\n\nHowever, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47.</ref> Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \nCyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|\"Robber Synod\" of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond.\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Icon St. Cyril of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Icon of St. Cyril of Alexandria]]\nCyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers. [[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was ''[[Theotokos]]'', meaning \"God bearer\", which became in Latin \"Mater Dei or Dei Genetrix\", or Mother of God), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct \"Jesus the man\" and \"the divine [[Logos]]\" in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.\n\nThe main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril affirmed that the Holy Trinity consists of a singular divine nature, essence, and being (''ousia'') in three distinct aspects, instantiations, or subsistencies of being (''hypostases''). These distinct hypostases are the Father or God in Himself, the Son or Word (''Logos''), and the Holy Spirit. Then, when the Son became flesh and entered the world, the pre-Incarnate divine nature and assumed human nature both remained, but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus. This resulted in the [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] slogan \"One Nature united out of two\" being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.  \n \nAccording to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son of God: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. The Logos Incarnate suffered and died on the Cross, and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril passionately argued for the continuity of a single subject, God the Word, from the pre-Incarnate state to the Incarnate state. The divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world\u2014not merely bestowed upon, semantically affixed to, or morally associated with the man Jesus, as the [[adoptionism|adoptionists]] and, he believed, Nestorius had taught.\n\n===Mariology===\nCyril of Alexandria became noted in [[Church history]] because of his spirited fight for the title \"[[Theotokos]]<ref>[https://independent.academia.edu/EIRINIARTEMINationalandCapodistrianUniversityofAthens/Papers/1721697/The_rejection_of_the_term_Theotokos_by_Nestorius_Constantinople The rejection of the term Theotokos by Nestorius Constantinople]</ref>\" during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431).\n\nHis writings include the homily given in Ephesus  and several other sermons.<ref>PG 76,992, ''Adv. Nolentes confiteri Sanctam Virginem esse Deiparem'', PG 76, 259.</ref> Some of his alleged homilies are in dispute as to his authorship. In several writings, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus to his mother. On the [[Cross]], he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in [[Cana]], he bows to her wishes. Cyril created the basis for all other [[mariology|mariological]] developments through his teaching of the blessed Virgin Mary, as the \"[[Mother of God]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Justo L.|title=The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation|date=1984|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York|isbn=9780060633158|page=254}}</ref> The conflict with Nestorius was mainly over this issue, and it has often been misunderstood. \"[T]he debate was not so much about Mary as about Jesus.

In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegetical documents. Among these were: ''Commentaries on the [[Old Testament]]'',<ref>Cyril of Alexandria, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_00_intro.htm Commentary on Luke (1859)], Preface, pp.i-xx.</ref> ''Thesaurus'', ''Discourse Against [[Arianism|Arians]]'', ''Commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]]'',<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_00_eintro.htm Cyril of Alexandria, Commentary on John, LFC 43, 48 (1874/1885).

''Butler's Lives of the Saints.'' (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), pp 83.</ref> {{ndash}} 386 AD). He is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. In 1883, Cyril was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. He is highly respected in the [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian Community]].\n\nAbout the end of 350 AD he succeeded Maximus as Bishop of Jerusalem, but was exiled on more than one occasion due to the enmity of [[Acacius of Caesarea]], and the policies of various emperors. Cyril left important writings documenting the instruction of [[catechumen]]s and the order of the [[Liturgy]] in his day.\n\n==Life and character==\nLittle is known of his life before he became a [[bishop]]; the assignment of his birth to the year 315 rests on conjecture.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/newschaffherzog29haucgoog#page/n356/mode/2up Jackson, Samuel Macauley,ed., \"Cyril of Jersusalem\", ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', (3rd ed.) p.334, London and New York, Funk & Wagnalls, 1914]</ref> According to Butler, Cyril was born at or near the city of Jerusalem, and was apparently well-read in both the Church fathers and the pagan philosophers.<ref name=butler>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CYRIJERU.htm Butler, Alban.

About the end of 350 he succeeded St. Maximus in the [[Episcopal See|See]] of Jerusalem.<ref name = \"laielh\">*\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year\" edited by Rev. Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1955, p. 112</ref><ref>The evidence for this is the ''Catecheses'' by Cyril where he continually refers to himself as bishop</ref><ref>Jerome gives a dark account of how Cyril came to be appointed as Bishop of Jerusalem, claiming that \u201cCyril was an out and out Arian, was offered the see on Maximus' death on the condition that he would repudiate his ordination at the hands of that Bishop\u201d.(Yarnold (2000), p4) Jerome had personal reasons for being malicious, though, and, the story may simply be a case of Cyril conforming to proper church order.Young (2004), p186</ref>\n\n==Episcopacy==\nRelations between [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Acacius of Caesarea]] and Cyril became strained. Acacius is presented as a leading [[Arianism|Arian]] by the orthodox historians, and his opposition to Cyril in the 350s is attributed by these writers to this. Sozomen also suggests that the tension may have been increased by Acacius's jealousy of the importance assigned to St. Cyril's See by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], as well as by the threat posed to Caesarea by the rising influence of the seat of Jerusalem as it developed into the prime Christian holy place and became a centre of pilgrimage.<ref>Sozomen, ''HE'', 4.25</ref>\n\nAcacius charged Cyril with selling church property.<ref>Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background\u2019\u2019, (2nd edn, 2004), p187</ref> The city of Jerusalem had suffered drastic food shortages at which point church historians Sozomen and Theodoret report \u201cCyril secretly sold sacramental ornaments of the church and a valuable holy robe, fashioned with gold thread that the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] had once donated for the bishop to wear when he performed the rite of [[Baptism]]\u201d.<ref name = \"cyril\">Drijvers, J. W. (2004). Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and city. Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, v. 72. Leiden: Brill. , p. 65</ref> It was believed that Cyril sold some plate, ornaments and imperial gifts to keep his people from starving.\n\nFor two years, Cyril resisted Acacius' summons to account for his actions in selling off church property, but a council held under Acacius's influence in 357 deposed St. Cyril in his absence (having officially charged him with selling church property to help the poor) and Cyril took refuge with Silvanus, Bishop of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].<ref>Di Berardino, Angelo. 1992. Encyclopedia of the early church. New York: Oxford University Press. , p. 312</ref> The following year, 359, in an atmosphere hostile to Acacius, the [[Council of Seleucia]] reinstated Cyril and deposed Acacius. In 360, though, this was reversed by Emperor Constantius,<ref>The reasons for this reversal are not entirely clear. According to Theodoret, (''HE'' 2.23), Acacius informed the emperor that one of the things sold by Cyril was a 'holy robe' dedicated by Constantine himself, which consequently turned Constantius against Cyril. The truth of this is not clear though.</ref> and Cyril suffered another year's exile from Jerusalem until the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s accession allowed him to return.\n\nCyril was once again banished from Jerusalem by the [[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] in 367. St. Cyril was able to return again at the accession of Emperor [[Gratian]] in 378, after which he remained undisturbed until his death in 386. In 380, St. [[Gregory of Nyssa]] came to Jerusalem on the recommendation of a council held at Antioch in the preceding year. He found the faith in accord with the truth, but the city a prey to parties and corrupt in morals.<ref name=Chapman>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04595b.htm Chapman, John. \"Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 16 Mar. 2015]</ref> Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), at which he was present.<ref name=Foley/> At that council he voted for acceptance of the term ''homoousios'', having been finally convinced that there was no better alternative.<ref name = \"laielh\"/> His story is perhaps best representative of those Eastern bishops (perhaps a majority), initially mistrustful of Nicaea, who came to accept the creed of that council, and the doctrine of the ''homoousion''.<ref name=\"Andrew Louth 2010 p284\">Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young et al., ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p284</ref>\n\n==Theological position==\nThough his [[theology]] was at first somewhat indefinite in phraseology, he undoubtedly gave a thorough adhesion to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Orthodoxy]]. Even if he did avoid the debatable term ''[[homoousian|homoousios]]'', he expressed its sense in many passages, which exclude equally [[Patripassianism]], [[Sabellianism]], and the formula \"there was a time when the Son was not\" attributed to Arius.<ref name=Chapman/> In other points he takes the ordinary ground of the Eastern Fathers, as in the emphasis he lays on the freedom of the will, the ''autexousion'' (\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), and in his view of the nature of sin. To him sin is the consequence of freedom, not a natural condition. The body is not the cause, but the instrument of sin. The remedy for it is repentance, on which he insists. Like many of the Eastern Fathers, he focuses on high moral living as essential to true Christianity. His doctrine of the [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]] is not quite so realistic as that of other Fathers; but his conception of the Church is decidedly empirical: the existing Church form is the true one, intended by Christ, the completion of the Church of the [[Old Testament]]. His interpretation of the [[Eucharist]] is disputed. If he sometimes seems to approach the symbolic view, at other times he comes very close to a strong realistic doctrine. The bread and wine are not mere elements, but the body and blood of Christ.\n\nCyril's writings are filled with the loving and forgiving nature of God which was somewhat uncommon during his time period. Cyril fills his writings with great lines of the healing power of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit, like \u201cThe Spirit comes gently and makes himself known by his fragrance. He is not felt as a burden for God is light, very light. Rays of light and knowledge stream before him as the Spirit approaches. The Spirit comes with the tenderness of a true friend to save, to heal, to teach, to counsel, to strengthen and to console\u201d.  Cyril himself followed God's message of forgiveness many times throughout his life. This is most clearly seen in his two major exiles where Cyril was disgraced and forced to leave his position and his people behind. He never wrote or showed any ill will towards those who wronged him. Cyril stressed the themes of healing and regeneration in his catechesis.<ref name=hell>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hWbqS96Gii8C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=Cyril+of+Jerusalem+Eschatology&source=bl&ots=043lA4RXF8&sig=jDi8qivjNcWk2I5Blmx_w5Y6w6U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOlL_ToJbLAhVCez4KHRQGCl04ChDoAQghMAE#v=onepage&q=Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem%20Eschatology&f=false Hellemo, Geir.

Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young et al., ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p284</ref> The ''Catechetical Lectures'' were given in the ''Martyrion'', the basilica erected by Constantine.<ref name=\"Andrew Louth 2010 p284\"/> They contain instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practice, in rather a popular than a scientific manner, full of a warm pastoral love and care for the catechumens to whom they were delivered. Each lecture is based upon a text of Scripture, and there is an abundance of Scriptural quotation throughout. In the ''Catechetical Lectures'', parallel with the exposition of the [[Creed]] as it was then received in the Church of Jerusalem are vigorous polemics against [[Paganism|pagan]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian heresy|heretical]] errors. They are of great importance for the light which they throw upon the method of instruction usual of that age, as well as upon the liturgical practises of the period, of which they give the fullest account extant.<ref name=Foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1326 Foley, Leonard O.F.M., \"St. Cyril of Jerusalem\", ''Saint of the Day'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not only among us, who are marked with the name of Christ, that the dignity of faith is great; all the business of the world, even of those outside the Church, is accomplished by faith. By faith, marriage laws join in union persons who were strangers to one another. By faith, agriculture is sustained; for a man does not endure the toil involved unless he believes he will reap a harvest. By faith, seafaring men, entrusting themselves to a tiny wooden craft, exchange the solid element of the land for the unstable motion of the waves.\u201d<ref>Cyril, Catechesis V</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem discusses the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are [[Original sin]] and Jesus\u2019 sacrificing himself to save us from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant about the fact that Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes \u201cwho did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten\u201d.{{sfn|Drijvers (2004), p. 7}} This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes \u201cI gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting\u201d.{{sfn|Drijvers (2004), p. 13-14}} This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.\n\nDanielou see the baptism rite are carrying eschatological overtones, in that \"to inscribe for baptism is to write one's name in the register of the elect in heaven\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=E5AdzMNMZzMC&pg=PA61&dq=Cyril+of+Jerusalem+Eschatology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwii1-G_qJbLAhXKdT4KHWc_DkwQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&q=Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem%20Eschatology&f=false Bergin, Liam.

Cyril spent a good part of his episcopacy in intermittent exile from Jerusalem. Abraham Malherbe argued that when a leader's control over a community is fragile, directing attention to the imminent arrival of the antichrist effectively diverts attention from that fragility.<ref name=Dayna/>\n\nSoon after his appointment, Cyril in his ''Letter to Constantius''<ref>English translation is in Telfer (1955)</ref> of 351 recorded the appearance of a cross of light in the sky above [[Golgotha]], witnessed by the whole population of Jerusalem. The Greek church commemorates this miracle on the 7th of May. Though in modern times the authenticity of the ''Letter'' has been questioned, on the grounds that the word ''homoousios'' occurs in the final blessing, many scholars believe this may be a later interpolation, and accept the letter's authenticity on the grounds of other pieces of internal evidence.<ref>Frances Young with Andrew Teal, ''From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background\u2019\u2019, (2nd edn, 2004), p192</ref>\n\nCyril interpreted this as both a sign of support for Constantius, who was soon to face the usurper [[Magnentius]], and as announcing the Second Coming, which was soon to take place in Jerusalem.

Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city [[Beth-zur|Bethsura]], that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies.\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+AJ+12.287 Perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish Antiquities'' xii. 7, \u00a7 7, #323</ref>\n\n=== Other ancient sources ===\nThe story of Hanukkah is alluded to in the book of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]]. The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in {{bibleverse||1 Maccabees|4:36\u20134:59|NRSVCE}}, though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:18\u20131:36|NRSVCE}} according to which the relighting of the altar fire by [[Nehemiah]] was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The above account in 1 Maccabees 4, as well as {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:9|NRSVCE}} portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths ([[Sukkot]])\"; similarly {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|10:6|NRSVCE}} explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".\n\nAnother source is the [[Megillat Antiochus]].

And they sought after pure [[olive oil]] to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of \u1e24ashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.}}\n[[File:Section from Aramaic Scroll of Antiochus, April

Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional ''shamash'' light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/synagogue-resources/wEru2YXmwx/ous-chanukah-guide/ |title=OU's Chanukah Guide|publisher=Orthodox Union|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the [[public sphere]] from the 1970s when Rabbi [[Menachem M.

Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some [[Ashkenazi Jews]] to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most [[Sephardi Jews]] light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic persecution]] were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in [[Iran|Persia]] under the rule of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the ''[[mezuzah]]'', so that when one passes through the door s/he is surrounded by the holiness of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (the [[613 commandments|commandments]]).<ref>https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.22a?lang=bi</ref>\n\nGenerally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \u201cfor they too were involved in the miracle.\u201d<ref>Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=1692 |title=The Obligation of Women Regarding Chanukah Candles |first=Rabbeinu Ovadia |last=Yosef |website=Halachayomit.co.il |date=11 December 2017 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Candle-lighting time ===\n[[File:Bialahanukabp.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] [[Rebbe#The \u1e24asidic Rebbe|Rebbe]] lights the menorah]]\nHanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.<ref name=\"ChabadHowTo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/603798/jewish/Chanukah-Guide.htm |title=How to Celebrate Chanukah |quote=[...] the menorah must contain enough fuel at the time of the lighting to burn until 30 minutes after nightfall. |accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref> The custom of many is to light at sundown, although most Hasidim light later.<ref name=\"ChabadHowTo\"/> Many Hasidic [[Rebbes]] light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rabbikaganoff.com/some-light-chanukah-questions/ |title=Some Light Chanukah Questions |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.<ref name=\"ChabadHowTo\"/> Friday night presents a problem, however.

Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/789857/jewish/Chanukah-FAQs.htm#q6 |title=Chanukah FAQs|website=Chabad.org |accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome\u2019s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection.

The Code, with variations, occurs in four epistles (letters) by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in 1&nbsp; Peter.

In a [[T\u00fcbingen]] dissertation,<ref>Crouch. James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel.'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1972.</ref> by James E. Crouch concludes that the early Christians found in Hellenistic Judaism a code which they adapted and Christianized.\n\nThe Staggs believe the several occurrences of the [[New Testament Household Code]] in the Bible were intended to meet the needs for ''order'' within the churches and in the society of the day. They maintain that the New Testament Household Codes are attempts by Paul and Peter to Christianize the harsh Codes for Roman citizens who had become followers of Christ. The Staggs write that there is some suggestion in scripture that because Paul had taught that they had newly found freedom \"in Christ\", wives, children, and slaves were taking improper advantage of the ''Haustafel'' both in the home and the church. \n\"The form of the code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female'.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}<ref name=Staggs/>\n\nSuch codes existed in Greek tradition. Two of these Christianized codes are found in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21-33}} (which contains the phrases \"husband is the head of the wife\" and \"wives, submit to your husband\") and in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}}, which instructs wives to subordinate themselves to their husbands.\n\nThe importance of the meaning of \"head\" as used by the [[Apostle Paul]] is pivotal in the conflict between the Complementarian position and the Egalitarian view. The word Paul used for \"head\", transliterated from Greek, is ''kephal\u0113''. Today's English word \"cephalic\" ({{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|f|\u00e6|l|\u1d7b|k}} {{Respell|s\u0259|FAL|ik}}) stems from the Greek ''kephal\u0113'' and means \"Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head.\" A thorough concordance search by [[Catherine Kroeger]] shows that the most frequent use of \"head\" ''(kephal\u0113)'' in the New Testament is to refer to \"the anatomical head of a body\". She found that its second most frequent use in the New Testament was to convey the metaphorical sense of \"source\".<ref>Kroeger, Catherine Clark. \"Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'\". ''Priscilla Papers,'' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.</ref><ref>Johnson, Alan F. \"A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings. ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006</ref> Other Egalitarian authors such as Margaret Howe agree with Kroeger, writing that \"The word 'head' (in {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&nbsp; Corinthians&nbsp;11:3}} and other similar passages) must be understood not as 'ruler' but as 'source{{' \"}}.<ref>Margaret Howe, Women and Church Leadership (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982), p. 60.</ref>\n\nWayne Grudem criticizes commonly rendering ''kephal\u0113'' in those same passages only to mean \"source\", and argues that it denotes \"authoritative head\" in such texts as {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3}}. They interpret that verse to mean that [[God the father]] is the authoritative head over the [[Jesus Christ|Son]], and in turn Jesus is the authoritative head over the church, not simply its source. By extension, they then conclude that in marriage and in the church, the man is the authoritative head over the woman.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf Wayne Grudem, \"Does Kefale (\"Head\") Mean \"Source\" Or \"Authority Over\" in Greek Literature? A Survey of 2,336 Examples\"] Trinity Journal ns 6.1 (Spring 1985): 38-59</ref>\n\nAnother potential way to define the word \"head\", and hence the relationship between husband and wife as found in Bible, is through the example given in the surrounding context in which the word is found.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:20-33}} In that context the husband and wife are compared to Christ and his church. The context seems to imply an authority structure based on a man sacrificing himself for his wife, as Christ did for the church; a love-based authority structure, where submission is not required but freely given based on the care given to the wife.<ref>Wickstrom, Mark. ''The Gospel of Grace.'' Beaver Pond Press, 2008.{{ISBN|978-1-59298-232-5}}</ref>\n\nSome biblical references on this subject are debated depending on one\u2019s school of theology. The [[Historical-grammatical method|historical grammatical method]] is a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. Thus references to a patriarchal Biblical culture may or may not be relevant to other societies. What is believed to be a timeless truth to one person or denomination may be considered a cultural norm or minor opinion to another.\n\n=== {{anchor|Egalitarian view}} Egalitarian view ===\n{{See also|Christian egalitarianism}}\n\nChristian Egalitarians (from the French word \"\u00e9gal\" meaning \"equal\") believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy\u2014a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to ''obey'' her husband. While \"obey\" was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in {{Bibleref2|1pet|3:6||1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:6}}, with that only being by implication from Sarah's obedience to Abraham.<ref name=\"Staggs\"/>{{rp|p.190}} Scriptures such as {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, \"there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.\"<ref name=CBE>Christians for Biblical Equality. \"Men, Women and Biblical Equality\".

The phrase \"mutual submission\" comes from a verse in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} which precedes advice for the three domestic relationships of the day, including slavery. It reads, \"Submit to one another ('mutual submission') out of reverence for Christ\", wives to husbands, children to parents, and slaves to their master. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in marriage is the most biblical view, producing the most intimate, wholesome, and reciprocally fulfilling marriages.<ref>Spencer, A\u00edda Besan\u00e7on, William Spencer. ''Marriage at the Crossroads''. InterVarsity Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2890-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Christian Egalitarian view<ref>Christian Egalitarian view as differentiated from humanistic egalitarianism</ref> of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.<ref name=Groothuis2>Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. \"The Bible and Gender Equality.\" [www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]</ref> A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to \"become one\", a biblical principle first ordained by God in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}, reaffirmed by Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-6}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}}, and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:30-32}}. Therefore, they see that \"oneness\" as pointing to [[gender equality]] in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family\u2014not one over the other nor one under the other.\n\nDavid Dykes, theologian, author, and pastor of a 15,000-member Baptist church, sermonized that \"When you are in Christ, you have full equality with all other believers\". In a sermon he entitled \"The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross\", he said that some theologians have called one particular Bible verse the Christian ''[[Magna Carta]]''. The Bible verse reads: \"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" ({{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28|NIV}}). Acknowledging the differences between men and women, Dykes writes that \"in Christ, these differences don't define who we are.

The KJV translates it as God saying, \"I will make a help meet for him\". The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun \"help\" and the adjective \"meet\" traditionally have been combined into a new noun, \"helpmate\". Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's \"helpmate\". Next, from the word \"help\" were drawn inferences of authority/subjection distinctions between men and women. \"Helper\" was taken to mean that husband was boss and wife his domestic. It is now realized that of the 21 times the Hebrew word 'ezer is used in the Old Testament, in eight of those instances the term clearly means \"savior\"\u2014another word for Jehovah God. For example, {{Bibleref2|Psalm|33:20}} says \"the Lord\u2026is our help ('ezer) and shield\". {{Bibleref2|Psalm|121:1-2}} reads \"I lift up my eyes to the mountains\u2014where does my help ('ezer) come from?

She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.\"<ref>[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp Southern Baptist Convention, Basic Beliefs] 2013</ref>}}\n\n===Biblical patriarchy===\n{{see also|Biblical patriarchy|Pater familias}}\n\nThe patriarchal model of marriage is clearly the oldest one. It characterized the theological understanding of most Old Testament writers. It mandates the supremacy, at times the ultimate domination, of the husband-father in the family. In the first century Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus, Paul, and Peter, it was the law of the land and gave the husband absolute authority over his wife, children, and slaves\u2014even the power of life or death. It subordinates all women.\n\nBiblical patriarchy is similar to [[Complementarianism]] but with differences of degree and emphasis. Biblical patriarchists carry the husband-headship model considerably further and with more militancy. While Complementarians also hold to exclusively male leadership in both the home and the church, Biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/ballot_box/should_christians_support_a_wo.aspx Should Christians Support a Woman for the Office of Civil Magistrate?].</ref> and indeed should not have careers outside the home.<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/called_to_the_home_called_to_r.aspx Called to the Home \u2014 Called to Rule].</ref>\n\nPatriarchy is based on authoritarianism\u2014complete obedience or subjection to male authority as opposed to individual freedom. Patriarchy gives preeminence to the male in essentially all matters of religion and culture. It explicitly deprives all women of social, political, and economic rights. The marriage relationship simply reinforced this dominance of women by men, providing religious, cultural, and legal structures that clearly favor patriarchy to the exclusion of even basic human dignity for wives.<ref name=Patriarchy/><ref>\"Are \u201cThe Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy\u201d Biblical?

It was the way of life throughout most of the Old Testament, religiously, legally, and culturally. However, it was not unique to Hebrew thought. With only minor variations, it characterized virtually every pagan culture of that day\u2014including all Pre-Christian doctrine and practice.<ref name=Patriarchy/>\n\nWhile Scripture allowed this approach in Old Testament times, nowhere does the Bible ordain it. In the Hebrew nation, patriarchy seems to have evolved as an expression of male dominance and supremacy, and of a double standard that prevailed throughout much of the Old Testament. Its contemporary advocates insist that it is the only biblically valid model for marriage today. They argue that it was established at Creation, and thus is a firm, unalterable decree of God about the relative positions of men and women.<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446579/patria-potestas]</ref>\n\nBiblical patriarchists see what they describe as a crisis of this era being what they term to be a systematic attack on the \"timeless truths of biblical patriarchy\". They believe such an attack includes the movement to \"subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship.\"<ref name=Patriarchy/> Arguing from the biblical presentation of God revealing himself \"as masculine, not feminine\", they believe God ordained distinct gender roles for man and woman as part of the created order. They say \"Adam\u2019s headship over Eve was established at the beginning, before sin entered the world\". Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct \"his\" household in paths of obedience to God. They refer to man's \"dominion\" beginning within the home, and a man\u2019s qualification to lead and ability to lead well in the public square is based upon his prior success in ''ruling his household''.<ref name=Patriarchy/>\n\nThus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as \"two-point Complementarianism\" (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as \"three-point\" or \"full\" complementarianism (male leadership in family, church ''and society'').<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/men_and_women_and_the_creation.aspx Men and Women and the Creation Order, Part 1 - Vision Forum Ministries]</ref>\n\nThe patriarchists teach that \"the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a \"keeper at home\", concluding that the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household. Biblical patriarchists consider that \"faithfulness to Christ requires that (Biblical patriarchy) be believed, taught, and lived\". They claim that the \"man is...the image and glory of God in terms of authority, while the woman is the glory of man\". They teach that a wife is to be ''obedient'' to her \"head\" (husband), based upon [[Old Testament]] teachings and models.\n\n=== Other views ===\n\nSee [[Christian feminism]]\n\n==Biblical foundations and history==\n\nChristians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of [[God in Christianity|God]]. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy.\n\nThe biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between [[Bride of Christ|Christ and the church]].\n\nIt is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure.

His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]].

Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God. Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage. Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602\u20131605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}</ref>\n\nThe valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic sacraments]].

Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.</ref> Therefore, it is considered a [[martyr]]dom as each spouse learns to die to self for the sake of the other. Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].<ref name=\"Grabbe\" />\n\n[[File:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]]).]]\n\nMarriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where \"two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name.\"{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}<ref name=\"Grabbe\" /> The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not \"perform\" the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they \"live\" the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.\n\nUnlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest\u2014not even a [[deacon]]\u2014may perform the Sacred Mystery.\n\nThe external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a \"Common Cup\" of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial \"dance\" in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, \"Dance, [[Isaiah]]\"\n\nThe sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.\n\nDivorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.<ref name=\"Grabbe\" /> The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.<ref name=\"Hapgood\">{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|publicationdate=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291\u2013305, 604\u2013605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}</ref>\n\n[[File:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]\n\n[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.\n\nAll people are called to celibacy\u2014human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.<ref name=\"Grabbe\">Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986\n</ref> The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.<ref name=\"Grabbe\" />\n\nOrthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[miaphysitism|Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] hold views almost identical to those of the ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

The church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry or be sealed in the temple. A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a \"cancellation of a sealing\" may be granted, but only by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carries somewhat of a stigma in the Mormon culture; the church teaches that the \"gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love\u2014provides the remedy for conflict in marriage.\"<ref>[https://www.lds.org/topics/divorce \"Gospel Topics: Divorce\"], lds.org.</ref> Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: \"No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry.

In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a [[metaclass]].\n\n== Class vs. type ==\nIn casual use, people often refer to the \"class\" of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have ''type'': the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of [[member function]]s (methods), and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation (specifically the implementation of the methods), and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation.{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=17}} In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation{{mdashb}}a ''concrete'' [[data structure]] and collection of subroutines{{mdashb}}while a type is an [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interface]]. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system); for example, the type <tt>Stack</tt> might be implemented with two classes{{snd}} <tt>SmallStack</tt> (fast for small stacks, but scales poorly) and <tt>ScalableStack</tt> (scales well but high overhead for small stacks). Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors.\n\nTypes generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something [[Nominalization|nominalized]], and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a <tt>Banana</tt> type might represent the properties and functionality of bananas in general, while the <tt>ABCBanana</tt> and <tt>XYZBanana</tt> classes would represent ways of producing bananas (say, banana suppliers or data structures and functions to represent and draw bananas in a video game). The <tt>ABCBanana</tt> class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the <tt>ABCBanana</tt> class would be objects of type <tt>Banana</tt>. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.\n\n== Design and implementation ==\nClasses are composed from structural and behavioral constituents.{{sfn|Gamma et al.|1995| p=14}} <!-- though there may not be a requirement to include any constituents at all--> Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class-related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.\n\n=== {{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure ===\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]\n\nA class contains [[Data (computing)|data]] field descriptions (or ''[[property (programming)|properties]]'', ''[[field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''data [[member variable|members]]'', or ''[[attribute (computing)|attributes]]''). These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use associative key-value containers.<ref name=\"pythondata model\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html|title=3. Data model|work=The Python Language Reference|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nSome programming languages support specification of [[class invariant|invariant]]s as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n{{Main|Method (computer programming)}}\n<!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces.

Methods are [[subroutine]]s with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=86-88}} <!-- (Note: Some languages allow direct access to instance variables ([[C++]])). --> Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods\u2014such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators\u2014are created and called by compiler-generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/|title=Classes (I)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/|title=Classes (II)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== The concept of class interface ===\n{{Main|Interface (computing)}}\n\nEvery class ''implements'' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure|structure]] and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=105}} There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract_and_Concrete|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.\n\nLanguages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from.\n\nFor example,if \"class A\" inherits from \"class B\" and if \"class B\" implements the interface \"interface B\" then  \"class A\" also inherits the functionality(constants and methods declaration) provided by \"interface B\".\n\nIn languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external <!--client--> code and thus are not part of the interface.\n\nObject-oriented programming methodology <!--is designed in such a way--> dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client <!--holds a valid reference--> has access to the object. {{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole paragraph...this is a rather specific statement about OOP methodology.|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== Example ====\nThe buttons on the front of your television set are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the \"power\" button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together comprise the interface. (Other television sets that are the same model as yours would have the same interface.) In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.\n\nA television set also has a myriad of ''attributes'', such as size and whether it supports color, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).\n\nGetting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a ''static method'' of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. Another example would be a static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects.\n\n=== Member accessibility ===\n{{redirects here|Private member|other uses|Private members club|and|Private member's bill}}\n{{Further|Information hiding}}\n\nThe following is a common set of [[access specifiers]]:<ref name=\"JavaAccessControl\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref>\n\n* ''Private'' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.\n* ''Protected'' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.\n* ''Public'' means that any code can access the member by its name.\n\nAlthough many object-oriented languages support the above access specifiers, <!-- {{Citation needed|reason=This is fairly obvious, but it needs to be cited--could even use a few links even to articles within Wikipedia.|date=April 2012}} -->their semantics may differ.\n\nObject-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants\u2014constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data.\n\nAccess specifiers do not necessarily control ''visibility'', in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP08-CPP.+Do+not+return+references+to+private+data|title=OOP08-CPP.

For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language does not allow client code that accesses the private data of a class to compile.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/errors.pdf|title=2.2 Identifiers|work=Compile and Runtime Errors in Java|first=Mordechai|last=Ben-Ari|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> <!-- whereas in languages like [[Objective-C]] or [[Perl]] client code is not restricted.--> In the [[C++]] language, private methods are visible, but not accessible in the interface; however, they may be made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.<ref name=\"cppinterface\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184410630|title=C++ Interfaces|last=Wild|first=Fred|work=Dr. Dobb's|publisher=UBM Techweb|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nSome languages feature other accessibility schemes:\n* ''Instance vs. class accessibility'': [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] supports ''instance-private'' and ''instance-protected'' access specifiers in lieu of class-private and class-protected, respectively. They differ in that they restrict access based on the instance itself, rather than the instance's class.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html | title=Classes, Objects, and Variables|work=Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide | last=Thomas | last2=Hunt | publisher=Ruby-Doc.org | accessdate=2012-04-26}}\n</ref>\n* ''Friend'': C++ supports a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as a [[friend function]] of the class may access the members designated as private or protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/\n|title=Friendship and inheritance|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n* ''Path-based'': Java supports restricting access to a member within a [[Java syntax#Access modifiers|Java package]], which is the logical path of the file. However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.<ref name=JavaAccessControl />\n\n== Inter-class relationships ==\nIn addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter-class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are ''compositional'' and ''hierarchical''.\n\n=== Compositional ===\nClasses can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a ''[[has-a]]'' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=180}} For example, a class \"Car\" could be composed of and contain a class \"Engine\". Therefore, a Car ''has an'' Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar [[Object lifetime|lifetime]]. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=128-129}} For example, in Objective-C 2.0:\n\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface Car : NSObject\n\n@property NSString *name;\n@property Engine *engine\n@property NSArray *tires;\n\n@end\n</source>\n\nThis <tt>Car</tt> class ''has'' an instance of <tt>NSString</tt> (a [[string (computer science)|string]] object), <tt>Engine</tt>, and <tt>NSArray</tt> (an array object).\n\n=== Hierarchical ===\nClasses can be ''derived'' from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived-from classes (''base classes'', ''parent classes'' or ''{{vanchor|superclasses|SUPERCLASS}}'') and the derived class (''child class'' or ''subclass'') . The relationship of the derived class to the derived-from classes is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=112}} For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are ''inherited'' by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members (data fields) and behavioral members (methods) in addition to those that they ''inherit'' and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can [[method overriding|override]] inherited methods if the language allows.\n\nNot all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class.<ref name=\"javainterface\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html|title=Interfaces|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]].\n\nExample (Simplified Objective-C 2.0 code, from iPhone SDK):\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface UIResponder : NSObject //...\n@interface UIView : UIResponder //...\n@interface UIScrollView : UIView //...\n@interface UITableView : UIScrollView //...\n</source>\nIn this example, a UITableView '''is a''' UIScrollView '''is a''' UIView '''is a''' UIResponder '''is an''' NSObject.\n\n==== Definitions of subclass ====\n{{Main|Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}\nConceptually, a superclass is a [[superset]] of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve <tt>GraphicObject</tt> as a superclass of <tt>Rectangle</tt> and <tt>Elipse</tt>, while <tt>Square</tt> would be a subclass of <tt>Rectangle</tt>. These are all [[Subset|subset relations]] in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.\n\nA common conceptual error is to mistake a ''part of'' relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car.\n\nIn object-oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example the Car class would have a property called <tt>parts</tt>. <tt>parts</tt> would be typed to hold a collection of objects such as instances of <tt>Body, Engine, Tires,...</tt>.\nObject modeling languages such as UML include capabilities to model various aspects of part of and other kinds of relations. Data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects. Things such as error checking on get and set methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=UML-to-Java transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect editions and related software|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/|work=ibm.com|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object-oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|pages=43\u201369|author2=Magnus Christerson |author3=Patrik Jonsson |author4=Gunnar Overgaard }}</ref>\n\nMost modern object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation.\n\nHowever, [[semantic web]] application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] are designed to support it.\n\nA similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their [[meta-object protocol]]s. Since classes are themselves first-class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C++ do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance ===\nAlthough class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as \"[[object-based languages]]\", support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object-based languages include earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]].<!-- do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behavior'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]). -->\n\n=== Within object-oriented analysis <!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--> ===\n{{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}<!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...-->\n\nIn [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi-directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship.<ref name=\"ibmuml\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/|title=UML Basics: The class diagram|last=Bell|first=Donald|work=developer Works|publisher=IBM|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=179}}\n\nAn association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a \"subscriber\" role describes the way instances of the class \"Person\" participate in a \"subscribes-to\" association with the class \"Magazine\". Also, a \"Magazine\" has the \"subscribed magazine\" role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are \"0..1\", \"1..1\", \"1..*\" and \"0..*\", where the \"*\" specifies any number of instances.<ref name=ibmuml />\n\n== Taxonomy of classes ==\nThere are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes|Abstract_and_Concrete}}Abstract and concrete ===\n{{Main|Abstract type}}\n\nIn a language that supports inheritance, an '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies [[abstract method]]s (or ''virtual methods''). An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via [[Type signature|signatures]] that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.<ref name=\"cpppoly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/\n|title=Polymorphism|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMost object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated.

In these languages, [[multiple inheritance]] is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). -->\n\n=== Local and inner ===\nIn some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.\n\nAn '''[[inner class]]''' is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'', also known as ''inner data type'' or ''nested type'', which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr061.htm | title=Nested classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr063.htm | title=Local type names (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAnother type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr062.htm | title=Local classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Metaclasses ===\n{{Main|Metaclass}}\n\nMetaclasses are classes whose instances are classes.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=133-134}} A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe particular kinds of classes.

Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class <tt>UnicodeConversionMixin</tt> might provide a method called <tt>unicode_to_ascii</tt> when included in classes <tt>FileReader</tt> and <tt>WebPageScraper</tt> that do not share a common parent.\n\n=== Partial ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn languages supporting the feature, a '''partial class''' is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single [[source code|source-code]] file or across multiple files.<ref name=\"mspartial\">{{Citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods|title=Partial Classes and Methods|work=C# Programming Guide|publication-date=2015-09-19|author1=mairaw|author2=BillWagner|author3=tompratt-AQ|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> The pieces are merged at compile-time, making compiler output the same as for a non-partial class.\n\nThe primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of [[code generator]]s, such as [[visual designer]]s.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/> It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer-written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse-grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of [[precompilation]] where it \"unifies\" all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual.\n\nOther benefits and effects of the partial class feature include:\n\n* Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way.\n* Eases navigation through large classes within an [[source code editor|editor]].\n* Enables [[separation of concerns]], in a way similar to [[aspect-oriented programming]] but without using any extra tools.\n* Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time. <!-- (This enabling may be considered by some or most to be a detriment rather than a benefit for SoC can apply to programmers also).-->\n\nPartial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]]. [[WinRT]] also supports partial classes.\n\n==== Example in VB.NET ====\nThis simple example, written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files.\n;file1.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Private _name As String\nEnd Class\n</source>\n;file2.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\nWhen compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nClass MyClass\n    Private _name As String\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\n\n==== Example in Objective-C ====\nIn [[Objective-C]], partial classes, also known as '''categories''', may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that a Objective-C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition (the first requires the last).<ref name=\"appleCategories\">{{citation|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW1|title=Customizing Existing Classes|work=Programming with Objective-C|publication-date=2014-09-17|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/>\n\nIn Foundation, header file NSData.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface NSData : NSObject\n\n- (id)initWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)URL;\n//...\n\n@end\n</source>\nIn user-supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData+base64.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n@interface NSData (base64)\n\n- (NSString *)base64String;\n- (id)initWithBase64String:(NSString *)base64String;\n\n@end\n</source>\nAnd in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import \"NSData+base64.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    if (argc < 2)\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    NSString *sourceURLString = [NSString stringWithCString:argv[1]];\n    NSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:sourceURLString]];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", [data base64String]);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\nThe dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.\n\n=== Uninstantiable ===\n'''Uninstantiable classes''' allow programmers to group together per-class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class.\n\nFor example, in C#, a class marked \"static\" can not be instantiated, can only have static members (fields, methods, other), may not have ''instance constructors'', and is ''sealed''.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3(v=vs.100).aspx | title=Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-08}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Unnamed ===\nAn '''unnamed class''' or '''anonymous class''' is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition. This is analogous to named versus [[anonymous function|unnamed functions]].\n\n== Benefits ==\nThe benefits of organizing software into object classes fall into three categories:<ref>{{cite web|title=What is an Object?|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html|work=oracle.com|publisher=Oracle Corporation|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n* Rapid development\n* Ease of maintenance\n* Reuse of code and designs\n\nObject classes facilitate rapid development because they lessen the semantic gap between the code and the users. System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object-oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object-oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-201-89551-3|pages=1\u201328|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/object/9780201895513|author2=Robert A.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.\n\nSoftware re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson |author3=Patrik Jonsson |author4=Gunnar Overgaard }}</ref>\n\n== Run-time representation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n\nAs a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct. A language may also support [[Prototype-based programming|prototype]] or [[Factory method pattern|factory]] [[metaobject]]s that represent run-time information about classes, or even represent metadata that provides access to [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] facilities and ability to manipulate data structure formats at run-time. Many languages distinguish this kind of [[run-time type information]] about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run-time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run-time and compile-time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes.\n\nFor example, if Human is a [[metaobject]] representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the Human [[metaobject]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Class-based programming]]\n* [[Class diagram]] (UML)\n* [[List of object-oriented programming languages]]\n* [[Mixin]]\n* [[Object-oriented programming]]\n* [[Prototype-based programming]]\n* [[Trait (computer programming)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Booch | first = Grady | year = 1994 | title = Objects and Design with Applications, Second Edition | publisher = Benjamin/Cummings\n}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Gamma | last2 = Helm | last3 = Johnson | last4 = Vlissides | year = 1995 | title = Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software | publisher = Addison Wesley\n}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-0-262-02523-2 | title = Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages: Types and Semantics | last = Bruce | first = Kim B. | year = 2002 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/foundations-object-oriented-languages}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://lucacardelli.name/TheoryOfObjects.html Abadi; Cardelli: A Theory of Objects]\n* [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ ISO/IEC 14882:2003 Programming Language C++, International standard]\n* [http://www.laputan.org/reflection/warfare.html Class Warfare: Classes vs. Prototypes], by Brian Foote\n* Meyer, B.: \"Object-oriented software construction\", 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, 1997, {{ISBN|0-13-629155-4}}\n* Rumbaugh et al.: \"Object-oriented modeling and design\", Prentice Hall, 1991, {{ISBN|0-13-630054-5}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web| title=Programming demo - .NET using Partial Types for better code | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaw8K8GNhAI | work=Hyper/Net | publisher=Youtube|date=October 2006| last=Dias| first=Tiago}}\n\n{{Programming language}}\n{{Data types}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Class (Computer Programming)}}\n[[Category:Class (computer programming)| ]]\n[[Category:Programming constructs]]\n[[Category:Programming language topics]]", "sha1": "c2x344sq1bdop2ql98kdidop00gvg3h"}}, {"title": "Canterbury (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "7394", "revision": {"id": "860439083", "parentid": "786880034", "timestamp": "2018-09-20T17:50:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Xezbeth", "id": "86247"}, "comment": "+1", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''[[Canterbury]]''' is a city located in the county of Kent in southeast England.

In practice, this means that they often retain a limited discrimination along the red-green axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in this dimension is reduced. Color blindness very rarely refers to complete monochromatism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sembulingam|first1=K.|last2=Sembulingam|first2=Prema|title=Essentials of Medical Physiology|date=2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd.|isbn=9789350259368|page=1002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdODr5fpxEAC&pg=PA1002|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908154704/https://books.google.com/books?id=tdODr5fpxEAC&pg=PA1002|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}</ref>\n\nDichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to distinguish a [[Braeburn]] apple from a [[Granny Smith]] or red from green of traffic lights without other clues\u2014for example, shape or position. Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with normal color vision.<ref name=\"Morgan\"/>\n\nColors of traffic lights are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a \"sighting board\") and so dichromats can more easily look for the position of the light within the rectangle\u2014top, middle or bottom. In the eastern provinces of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In the United States, this is not done by shape but by position, as the red light is always on the left if the light is horizontal, or on top if the light is vertical. However, a lone flashing light (e.g. red for stop, yellow for caution) is still problematic.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0456\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \"\u0456\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0456\" - \u0440\u0456\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u041f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0443\u0433.jpg|Normal sight\nFile:Deuteranopia sight.jpg|Deuteranopia sight\nFile:Tritanopia sight.jpg|Tritanopia sight\nFile:Monochromacy sight.jpg|Monochromacy sight\n</gallery>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Color blindness.png|thumb|upright=1.5|These color charts show how different colorblind people see compared to a person with normal color vision.]]\n'''Types of color blindness and the terms used'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||Cone<br>system||colspan=\"2\"|Red||colspan=\"2\"|Green||colspan=\"2\"|Blue\n|-\n| ||'''N'''=normal<br>'''A'''=anomalous ||'''N'''||'''A'''||'''N'''||'''A'''||'''N'''||'''A'''\n|-\n|1||Normal vision||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Trichromat||Normal\n|-\n|2||Protanomaly||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#700000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Anomalous Trichromat||Partially color blind||Red-green\n|-\n|3||Protanopia||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Dichromat||Partially color blind||Red-green\n|-\n|4||Deuteranomaly||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#007000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Anomalous Trichromat||Partially color blind||Red-green\n|-\n|5||Deuteranopia||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Dichromat||Partially color blind||Red-green\n|-\n|6||Tritanomaly||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000070\"|.||Anomalous Trichromat||Partially color blind||Blue-yellow\n|-\n|7||Tritanopia||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Dichromat||Partially color blind||Blue-yellow\n|-\n|8||Achromatopsia||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||Monochromat||Totally color blind\n|-\n|9||rowspan=\"2\"|Tetrachromat||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#700000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||\n|-\n|10||style=\"background:#FF0000\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||style=\"background:#00FF00\"|.||style=\"background:#007000\"|.||style=\"background:#0000FF\"|.||style=\"background:#000000\"|.||\n|}\n\nBased on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial.

When one cone system is compromised, [[dichromacy]] results. The most frequent forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle (green) or long (red) wavelength sensitive cone systems, and make it hard to discriminate reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as \"red-green color blindness\", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows from reds/pinks, and the rarest form of all, complete color blindness or ''[[monochromacy]]'', where one cannot distinguish any color from [[gray (color)|grey]], as in a [[black-and-white]] movie or photograph.\n\nProtanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color they see with some mixture of just two [[primary color]]s (in contrast to those with normal sight ([[Trichromacy|trichromats]]) who can distinguish three primary colors). Dichromats usually know they have a color vision problem, and it can affect their daily lives. Out of the male population, 2% have severe difficulties distinguishing between red, orange, yellow, and green. (Orange and yellow are different combinations of red and green light.) Colors in this range, which appear very different to a normal viewer, appear to a dichromat to be the same or a similar color. The terms protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek, and respectively mean \"inability to see (''anopia'') with the first (''prot-''), second (''deuter-''), or third (''trit-'') [cone]\".\n\nAnomalous trichromacy is the least serious type of color deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simunovic |first1=M P |title=Colour vision deficiency |journal=Eye |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=747\u201355 |year=2010 |pmid=19927164 |doi=10.1038/eye.2009.251 |url=http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v24/n5/pdf/eye2009251a.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922164856/http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v24/n5/pdf/eye2009251a.pdf |archivedate=2017-09-22 |df= }}</ref> People with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal. They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer, and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.\n\nProtanomaly and deuteranomaly can be diagnosed using an instrument called an [[anomaloscope]], which mixes spectral red and green lights in variable proportions, for comparison with a fixed spectral yellow. If this is done in front of a large audience of males, as the proportion of red is increased from a low value, first a small proportion of the audience will declare a match, while most will see the mixed light as greenish; these are the deuteranomalous observers. Next, as more red is added the majority will say that a match has been achieved. Finally, as yet more red is added, the remaining, protanomalous, observers will declare a match at a point where normal observers will see the mixed light as definitely reddish.\n\n=== Red-green color blindness ===\n\nProtanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly are commonly inherited forms of red-green color blindness which affect a substantial portion of the human population.

In turn, a carrier woman has a 50% chance of passing on a mutated X chromosome region to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his (defective) X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting an affected X chromosome from each parent.<ref name=harrison />\n\nBecause one X chromosome is [[Barr body|inactivated]] at random in each cell during a woman's development, deuteranomalous heterozygotes (i.e. female carriers of deuteranomaly) may be [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]], because they will have the normal long wave (red) receptors, the normal medium wave (green) receptors, the abnormal medium wave (deuteranomalous) receptors and the normal [[autosomal]] short wave (blue) receptors in their retinas.<ref name=Roth2006 /><ref name=thomas /><ref name=jordan /> The same applies to the carriers of protanomaly (who have two types of long wave receptors, normal medium wave receptors, and normal autosomal short wave receptors in their retinas). If, by rare chance, a woman is heterozygous for ''both'' protanomaly and deuteranomaly, she could be pentachromatic. This situation could arise if, for instance, she inherited the X chromosome with the abnormal long wave gene (but normal medium wave gene) from her mother who is a carrier of protanomaly, and her other X chromosome from a deuteranomalous father. Such a woman would have a normal and an abnormal long wave receptor, a normal and abnormal medium wave receptor, and a normal autosomal short wave receptor\u20145 different types of color receptors in all. The degree to which women who are carriers of either protanomaly or deuteranomaly are demonstrably tetrachromatic and require a mixture of four spectral lights to match an arbitrary light is very variable.

For a protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow are much reduced compared to normal. This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished. They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness, not on any perceptible hue difference. [[shades of violet|Violet]], [[shades of purple|lavender, and purple]] are indistinguishable from various [[shades of blue]] because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible. For example, [[pink]] flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue to the protanope. A very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye. These ''unilateral dichromats'' report that with only their protanopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and those longer than it as yellow.

A deuteranope suffers the same hue discrimination problems as protanopes, but without the abnormal dimming.

They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black.

The medium-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. Unlike in protanomaly, the intensity of colors is unchanged. The deuteranomalous person is considered \"green weak\". For example, in the evening, dark green cars appear to be black to deuteranomalous people. As with protanomates, deuteranomates are poor at discriminating small differences in [[hue]]s in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum.

They are forms of [[visual agnosia]].<ref name=blom/>\n\n[[Monochromacy]] is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color. Monochromats possess a complete inability to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness. It occurs in two primary forms:\n# [[Rod monochromacy]], frequently called ''achromatopsia'', where the retina contains no cone cells, so that in addition to the absence of color discrimination, vision in lights of normal intensity is difficult. While normally rare, achromatopsia is very common on the island of [[Pingelap]], a part of the [[Pohnpei]] state, [[Federated States of Micronesia]], where it is called ''maskun'': about 10% of the population there has it, and 30% are unaffected carriers. The island was devastated by a storm in the 18th century (an example of a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]]) and one of the few male survivors carried a gene for achromatopsia. The population grew to several thousand before foreign troops introduced diseases to the island in the 1940s.\n# [[Cone monochromacy]] is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only a single kind of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. Blue cone monochromacy (X chromosome) is caused by lack of functionality of L and M cones (red and green). It is encoded at the same place as red-green color blindness on the X chromosome. Peak spectral sensitivities are in the blue region of the visible spectrum (near 440 nm).

Monochromacy occurs when two or all three of the cone pigments are missing and color and lightness vision is reduced to one dimension.\n***[[Achromatopsia|Rod monochromacy]] (achromatopsia) is an exceedingly rare, nonprogressive inability to distinguish any colors as a result of absent or nonfunctioning retinal cones. It is associated with light sensitivity ([[photophobia]]), involuntary eye oscillations ([[nystagmus]]), and poor vision.\n***[[Cone monochromacy]] is a rare total color blindness that is accompanied by relatively normal vision, electroretinogram, and electrooculogram. Cone monochromacy can also be a result of having more than one type of dichromatic color blindness. People who have, for instance, both protanopia and tritanopia are considered to have cone monochromacy. Since cone monochromacy is the lack of/damage of more than one cone in retinal environment, having two types of dichromacy would be an equivalent.\n**[[Dichromacy]] is hereditary. Protanopia and deuteranopia are hereditary and sex-linked, affecting predominantly males.\n***Protanopia is caused by the complete absence of red retinal photoreceptors. Protans have difficulties distinguishing between blue and green colors and also between red and green colors. It is a form of dichromatism in which the subject can only perceive light wavelengths from 400 nm to 650 nm, instead of the usual 700 nm. Pure reds cannot be seen, instead appearing black; purple colors cannot be distinguished from blues; more orange-tinted reds may appear as dim yellows, and all orange-yellow-green shades of too long a wavelength to stimulate the blue receptors appear as a similar yellow hue. It is present in 1% of males.\n***Deuteranopia affects hue discrimination in a similar way to protanopia, but without the dimming effect. Again, it is found in about 1% of the male population.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.konanmedical.com/types-of-color-deficiencies | title=Types of Color Deficiencies | website=Konan Medical | access-date=2014-04-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150426144435/http://www.konanmedical.com/types-of-color-deficiencies | archivedate=2015-04-26 | df= }}</ref>\n***Tritanopia is a very rare color vision disturbance in which only the red and the green cone pigments are present, with a total absence of blue retinal receptors. Blues appear greenish, yellows and oranges appear pinkish, and purple colors appear deep red. It is related to chromosome 7; thus unlike protanopia and deuteranopia, tritanopia and tritanomaly are not sex-linked traits and can be acquired rather than inherited and can be reversed in some cases.\n**Anomalous [[trichromacy]] is a common type of inherited color vision deficiency, occurring when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity.\n***Protanomaly is a mild color vision defect in which an altered spectral sensitivity of red retinal receptors (closer to green receptor response) results in poor red-green hue discrimination. It is hereditary, sex-linked, and present in 1% of males. In contrast to other defects, in this case the L-cone is present but malfunctioning, whereas in protanopia the L-cone is completely missing.<ref>[http://www.color-blindness.com/protanopia-red-green-color-blindness/ Protanopia \u2013 Red\u2013Green Color Blindness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420025452/http://www.color-blindness.com/protanopia-red-green-color-blindness/ |date=2015-04-20 }}. color-blindness.com</ref>\n***Deuteranomaly, caused by a similar shift in the green retinal receptors, is by far the most common type of color vision deficiency, mildly affecting red-green hue discrimination in 5% of European males.

Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e. an acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.\n\nColor blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as it is the cones that detect the color frequencies of light.\n\nAbout 8% of males, and 0.6% of females, are red-green color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Color Vision: From Genes to Perception |last=Sharpe |first=L.T. |last2=Stockman |first2=A. |last3=J\u00e4gle |first3=H. |last4=Nathans |first4=J. |editor1-last=Gegenfurtner |editor1-first=K.

Normally, there are three kinds of cone cells, each containing a different pigment, which are activated when the pigments absorb light. The [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]] of the cones differ; one is most sensitive to short wavelengths, one to medium wavelengths, and the third to medium-to-long wavelengths within the [[visible spectrum]], with their peak sensitivities in the blue, green, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum, respectively. The absorption spectra of the three systems overlap, and combine to cover the visible spectrum. These receptors are known as short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones, but are also often referred to as blue, green, and red cones, although this terminology is inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Colour-vision-deficiency/Pages/Causes.aspx |title=Colour vision deficiency \u2013 Causes |publisher=NHS Choices |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104204/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Colour-vision-deficiency/Pages/Causes.aspx |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe receptors are each responsive to a wide range of wavelengths. For example, the long wavelength \"red\" receptor has its peak sensitivity in the yellow-green, some way from the red end (longest wavelength) of the visible spectrum. The sensitivity of normal color vision actually depends on the overlap between the absorption ranges of the three systems: different colors are recognized when the different types of cone are stimulated to different degrees. Red light, for example, stimulates the long wavelength cones much more than either of the others, and reducing the wavelength causes the other two cone systems to be increasingly stimulated, causing a gradual change in hue.\n\nMany of the genes involved in color vision are on the [[X chromosome]], making color blindness much more common in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two.

For example, a red-green colorblind person who is incapable of distinguishing colors on a map printed on paper may have no such difficulty when viewing the map on a computer screen or television. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Third, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient \"mass\" of color: thin lines might appear black, while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nDesigners should also note that red-blue and yellow-blue color combinations are generally safe. So instead of the ever-popular \"red means bad and green means good\" system, using these combinations can lead to a much higher ability to use color coding effectively. This will still cause problems for those with monochromatic color blindness, but it is still something worth considering.<ref name=\"Habibzadeh\">{{Cite journal|title = Our red\u2013green world|journal = Australian Health Review|volume = 40|issue = 4|page = 474|date = 2015-01-01|doi = 10.1071/ah15161|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}</ref>\n\nWhen the need to process visual information as rapidly as possible arises, for example in an emergency situation, the visual system may operate only in shades of gray, with the extra information load in adding color being dropped.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This is an important possibility to consider when designing, for example, emergency brake handles or emergency phones.\n\n===Occupations===\nColor blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain occupations. Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job (''e.g.,'' mixing paint colors), or in which color perception is important for safety (''e.g.,'' operating vehicles in response to color-coded signals). This occupational safety principle originates from the [[Lagerlunda rail accident|Lagerlunda train crash]] of 1875 in Sweden. Following the crash, Professor [[Alarik Frithiof Holmgren]], a physiologist, investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer (who had died) had caused the crash. Professor Holmgren then created the first test using different-colored skeins to exclude people from jobs in the transportation industry on the basis of color blindness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Algis |first1=J. |last2=Vingrys |first2=J. |last3=Cole |first3=Barry L. |title=Origins of colour vision standards within the transport industry |journal=Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=369\u201375 |year=1986 |pmid=3306566 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.1986.tb01155.x }}</ref> However, there is a claim that there is no firm evidence that color deficiency did cause the collision, or that it might have not been the sole cause.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mollon |first1=JD |last2=Cavonius |first2=LR |title=The Lagerlunda Collision and the Introduction of Color Vision Testing |journal=Survey of Ophthalmology |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=178\u201394 |year=2012 |pmid=22301271 |doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2011.10.003 }}</ref>\n\nColor vision is important for occupations using telephone or computer networking cabling, as the individual wires inside the cables are color-coded using green, orange, brown, blue and white colors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Michael|title=All in One A+ Certification Exam Guide|edition=4th|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Osborne|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-07-222274-3}}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> Electronic wiring, transformers, resistors, and capacitors are color-coded as well, using black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, gray, white, silver, gold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grob|first=Bernard|title=Basic Electronics|year=2001|publisher=Glencoe/McGraw-Hill|location=Columbus, Ohio|isbn=0-02-802253-X}}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Driving===\nSome countries have refused to grant driving licenses to individuals with color blindness.

Some examples include color-gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication, color-coded glide-path indications on runways, and the like. Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons who suffer from color blindness for this reason. Restrictions may be partial, allowing color-blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions, or total, in which case color-blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of their medical clearance in order to obtain the required medical certificate, a prerequisite to obtaining a pilot's certification. If testing reveals color blindness, the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions, such as no night flying and no flying by color signals\u2014such a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from holding certain flying occupations, such as that of an airline pilot, although commercial pilot certification is still possible, and there are a few flying occupations that do not require night flight and thus are still available to those with restrictions due to color blindness (e.g., agricultural aviation). The government allows several types of tests, including medical standard tests (''e.g.,'' the [[Ishihara test|Ishihara]], [[Israel Dvorine|Dvorine]], and others) and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation. If an applicant fails the standard tests, they will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states: \"Not valid for night flying or by color signal control\". They may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test, administered by the FAA. Typically, this test is the \"color vision light gun test\". For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower. The color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower, and they must identify the color. If they pass they may be issued a waiver, which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations. They will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed. This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA), but the SODA was dropped, and converted to a simple waiver (letter) early in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/ | title=Aerospace Medical Dispositions \u2014 Color vision | accessdate=2009-04-11 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512031034/https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/ | archivedate=2009-05-12 | df= }}</ref>\n\nResearch published in 2009 carried out by the [[City University of London]]'s Applied Vision Research Centre, sponsored by the UK's [[Civil Aviation Authority]] and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, has established a more accurate assessment of color deficiencies in pilot applicants' red/green and yellow-blue color range which could lead to a 35% reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/05/29/327137/colour-blindness-research-could-clear-more-pilots-to-fly-uk.html|title=Colour-blindness research could clear more pilots to fly: UK CAA|last=Warburton|first=Simon|date=29 May 2009|work=Air transport|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=29 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602082019/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/05/29/327137/colour-blindness-research-could-clear-more-pilots-to-fly-uk.html|archivedate=2 June 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Art ===\nInability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist.

They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.\n\n===Denial-of-service attacks===\n[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<ref>{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points \u2013 and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], but a range of other techniques are possible including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.\n\n===Direct-access attacks===\nAn unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice.<ref>[http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ Wireless mouse leave billions at risk of computer hack: cyber security firm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050123/http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ |date=3 April 2016 }}\n</ref> Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s.

An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would \"allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyberattackers to threaten the electric grid.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Impact of security breaches==\nSerious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. \"Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal.\"<ref>Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., & Webel, B. (2004). The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks. Congressional Research Service, Government and Finance Division.

According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438\u2013457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>\n\n==Attacker motivation==\nAs with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced, but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]],  in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.\n\nA standard part of [[threat modelling]] for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home [[personal computer]], [[bank]], and [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]] face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.\n\n==Computer protection (countermeasures)==\nIn computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.<ref name=rfc2828>{{IETF RFC|2828}} Internet Security Glossary</ref><ref name=CNSSI4009>[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227163121/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }} dated 26 April 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|title=InfosecToday Glossary|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120041536/http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:\n\n===Security by design===\n{{Main|Secure by design}}\n\n[[Secure by design|Security by design]], or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure.  In this case, security is considered as a main feature.\n\nSome of the techniques in this approach include:\n* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.\n* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.\n* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.\n* Default secure settings, and design to \"fail secure\" rather than \"fail insecure\" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.\n* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.\n* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the \"[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]\" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.\n\n===Security architecture===\nThe Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as \"the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]\".<ref>[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006</ref>\n\nTechopedia defines security architecture as \"a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible.\" The key attributes of security architecture are:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.\n* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.\n* the standardization of controls.\n\n===Security measures===\nA state of computer \"security\" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response.  These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:\n\n* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering.  Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.\n* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.\n* \"Response\" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.\n\nToday, computer security comprises mainly \"preventive\" measures, like firewalls or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called \"physical firewall\", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].\n\nSome organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to extend data accessibility and [[machine learning]] to detect [[advanced persistent threat]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|title=Cybersecurity at petabyte scale|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713120506/http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|title=Why ONI May Be Our Best Hope for Cyber Security Now|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=9 May 2016|work=|access-date=13 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015812/https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place. As a result, as Reuters points out: \"Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |title=Firms lose more to electronic than physical theft |publisher=Reuters |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113829/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated \"detection\" systems.

It requires \"something you know\"; a password or PIN, and \"something you have\"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.\n\nSocial engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in a highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.\n\nEnoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.<ref>Treglia, J., & Delia, M.

The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key.  The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.

Beyond this, [[formal verification]]  aims to prove the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of the [[algorithms]] underlying a system;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=21 May 2010}}</ref>\nimportant for [[cryptographic protocol]]s for example.\n\n===Capabilities and access control lists===\n{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}\n\nWithin computer systems, two of many [[Computer security model|security models]] capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nCapabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s, while commercial OSs still use ACLs.

If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.\n* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.\n* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\n* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cyber security.

There is no global cyber law and cyber security treaty that can be invoked for enforcing global cyber security issues.\n\nInternational legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. Even if an antivirus firm locates the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular [[Virus (computer)|virus]] or piece of [[malware]] or form of [[Cyber-Attacks|cyber attack]], often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.<ref name=\"ted.com\">{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen: Fighting viruses, defending the net |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |publisher=TED |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116010603/http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen \u2013 Behind Enemy Lines |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |publisher=Hack In The Box Security Conference |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125075257/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |archivedate=25 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Authorship attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is a major problem for all law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"[[Computer viruses]] switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another \u2013 moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this.

Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.<ref name=\"The new cyber arms race\">{{cite web |last1=Clayton |first1=Mark |title=The new cyber arms race |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |website=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416090310/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |archivedate=16 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis has led to new terms such as ''[[cyberwarfare]]'' and ''[[cyberterrorism]]''.

These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card|identification cards]], [[smart card|smart cards]], and [[biometric]] systems.\n* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).\n* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable \u2013 and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.\n* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.]\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.\n* [[Backup|Backups]] are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.\n* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.\n* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.\n* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.<ref>{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>\n* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.\n* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.\n* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]\n* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher|ciphers]] are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key|shared keys]], and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate|digital certificates]] can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.\n* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.\n* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. \n* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.\n* [[Intrusion-detection system|Intrusion-detection systems]] are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.\n* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level \u2013 and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].\n* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard \"ping\" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.\n* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] with the purpose of identifying accessible network services.\n* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.\n\n==Scholars==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Ross J.

He has primarily directed music videos for [[ambient music]] and [[electronica]] acts such as [[Autechre]] and [[Aphex Twin]].  He has also created art installations and directed short movies.  He was approached to direct a movie version of the [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', but nothing came of early discussions.  In the 2000s, Cunningham began doing [[music production]] work.  He has also designed album artwork for a variety of musicians.\n\n==Early work==\nAfter seeing Cunningham's work on the 1995 film version of ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', [[Stanley Kubrick]] head-hunted Cunningham<ref>[http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/pr06.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623094651/http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/pr06.html |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref> to design and supervise [[Animatronics|animatronic]] tests of the central robot child character in his version of the film ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]''. Cunningham worked for over a year on the film before leaving to pursue a career as a director.\n\nEarlier work in film included model-making, [[prosthetic make-up]] and concept illustrations for ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' and ''[[Dust Devil (1993 film)|Dust Devil]]'' for director [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]]; work on ''[[Nightbreed]]'' for [[Clive Barker]]; and on ''[[Alien3|Alien<sup>3</sup>]]'' for [[David Fincher]]. Between 1990 and 1992, he contributed the occasional cover painting and strip to ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', working under the pseudonym \"Chris Halls\"; Halls is his stepfather's surname.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=CHRISH |title=droid zone |publisher=2000AD Online |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>\n\n==Music videos==\n<!--[[Music video director]] links directly here.-->\nCunningham has had close ties to [[Warp Records]] since his first production for [[Autechre]]. Videos for [[Aphex Twin]]'s \"[[Come to Daddy]]\" and \"[[Windowlicker]]\" are perhaps his best known. His video for [[Bj\u00f6rk]]'s \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\" won multiple awards, including an [[MTV]] music video award for Breakthrough Video and was nominated for a [[Grammy]] for Best Short Form Music Video. It was also the first ever music video to win a Gold Pencil at the [[D&AD]] Awards. It can still be seen at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. His video for [[Aphex Twin]]'s \"[[Windowlicker]]\" was nominated for the \"Best Video\" award at the Brit Awards 2000. He also directed [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]\" video which became an international hit and won the award for Best Special Effects at the 1998 MTV Music Video Awards. Cunningham also came out of a seven-year hiatus from making music videos to direct the video for \"[[Sheena Is a Parasite]]\" by [[The Horrors]].\n\n==Video art==\nHis video installation ''[[Flex (film)|Flex]]'' was first shown in 2000 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], and subsequently at the [[Anthony d'Offay]] Gallery and other art galleries. ''Flex'' was commissioned by the [[Anthony d'Offay]] Gallery for the [[Apocalypse: Beauty & Horror in Contemporary Art]] exhibition curated by [[Norman Rosenthal]] and Max Wigram at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 2000.\n\nThe Anthony d'Offay Gallery also commissioned ''[[Monkey Drummer]]'', a 2\u00bd minute piece intended for exhibition as a companion to ''Flex'' at the 2000 ''Apocalypse'' exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]: however, the piece was not finished in time. In it an [[automaton]] with nine appendages and the head of a monkey plays the drums to \"Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount\", the 10th track on [[Aphex Twin]]'s 2001 album ''[[drukqs]]''.

In 2002 both ''Flex'' and ''[[Monkey Drummer]]'' were exhibited by 5th Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, in an exhibition curated by Artist/Curator Paul Murnaghan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://5thgalleryarchive.com/archive/flex.htm |title=Chris Cunningham : flex |publisher=5thgalleryarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116043255/http://5thgalleryarchive.com/archive/flex.htm |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/monkey.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623094951/http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/monkey.html |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, an excerpt from ''Flex'' was shown in the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]]'s exhibition Seduced: Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now curated by [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]], Marina Wallace and Joanne Bernstein. alongside other pieces by [[Bacon]], [[Klimt]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Picasso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Seduced,_Art_and_Sex_from_Antiquity_to_Now |title=Seduced, Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now&nbsp;\u2014 The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia |publisher=Artandpopularculture.com |date=2009-07-18 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>\n\n==Short films==\nIn 2005, Cunningham released the short film ''[[Rubber Johnny]]'' as a DVD accompanied by a book of photographs and drawings. ''Rubber Johnny'', a six-minute experimental short film cut to a soundtrack by [[Aphex Twin]] remixed by Cunningham, was shot between 2001 and 2004. Shot on DV night-vision, it was made in Cunningham's own time as a home movie of sorts, and took three and half years of weekends to complete.

These performances evolved into ''Chris Cunningham Live'', a 55 minute long performance piece combining original and remixed music and film. It features remixed, unreleased and brand new videos and music dynamically edited together into a new live piece spread over three screens. The sound accompanying these images includes Cunningham's first publicly performed compositions interspersed with his remixes of other artist's work. ''Chris Cunningham Live'' debuted as one of the headline attractions at Warp 20 in Paris on 8 May 2009 with other performances scheduled at festivals in UK, and a number of European cities later in the year. ''Chris Cunningham Live'' continued in June 2011, with performances in London, Barcelona, and Sydney, Australia.\n\n==Photography==\nCunningham has created photography and cover artwork for various people including [[Bj\u00f6rk]]'s \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", [[Aphex Twin]]'s \"[[Windowlicker]]\" and \"[[Come to Daddy]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Cunningham produced a fashion shoot for ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' using [[Grace Jones]] as a model to create \"Nubian versions\" of Rubber Johnny.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/ArtsAndCulture/article/1273/1/Chris_Cunningham_Photographs_Grace_Jones_for_DC |title=Grace Jones photoshoot for Dazed and Confused |publisher=Dazeddigital.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>  In an interview for BBC's \"The Culture Show\", it was suggested that the collaboration may expand into a video project. In regards to the collaboration, Cunningham stated \"For me, Grace has the strongest iconography of any artist in music.

However, because ''Neuromancer'' was due to be a big budget studio film, it is rumoured that Cunningham pulled out due to being a first time director without final cut approval.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} He also felt that too much of the original book's ideas had been cannibalised by other recent films.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nOn 18 November 2004, in the FAQ on the William Gibson Board, Gibson was asked:\n\n{{quote|Q: Is it true there's a movie of ''Neuromancer'' in the works?\n\nA: Perpetually, it seems, and going on a quarter of a century now.

We were told, third-hand, that he was extremely wary of the Hollywood process, and wouldn't return calls. But someone else told us that ''Neuromancer'' had been his ''Wind In The Willows'', that he'd read it when he was a kid. I went to London and we met.\" Gibson is also quoted in the article as saying \"Chris is my own 100 per cent personal choice...My only choice. The only person I've met who I thought might have a hope in hell of doing it right. I went back to see him in London just after he'd finished the Bjork video, and I sat on a couch beside this dead sex little Bjork robot, except it was wearing Aphex Twin's head.

'''hippocentaur'''.</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n===Origin===\nThe centaurs were usually said to have been born of [[Ixion]] and [[Nephele]] (the cloud made in the image of [[Hera]]). Another version, however, makes them children of a certain [[Centaurus (Greek mythology)|Centaurus]], who mated with the [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]]n mares. This Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of [[Apollo]] and [[Stilbe]], daughter of the river god [[Peneus]]. In the later version of the story his twin brother was [[Lapithes (hero)|Lapithes]], ancestor of the [[Lapith]]s, thus making the two warring peoples cousins.\n\nCentaurs were said to have inhabited the region of Magnesia and Mount [[Pelion]] in [[Thessaly]], the [[Foloi oak forest]] in [[Elis]], and the Malean peninsula in southern [[Laconia]].\n\nAnother tribe of centaurs was said to have lived on [[Cyprus]].  According to [[Nonnus]], they were fathered by [[Zeus]], who, in frustration after [[Aphrodite]] had eluded him, spilled his seed on the ground of that land.  Unlike those of mainland Greece, the Cyprian centaurs were horned.<ref>[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', v. 611 ''ff'', xiv. 193 ''ff'', xxxii. 65 ''ff''.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/KentauroiKyprioi.html|title=CYPRIAN CENTAURS (Kentauroi Kyprioi) - Half-Horse Men of Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref>\n\nThere were also the Lamian Pheres, twelve rustic daimones of the [[Lamos (Cilicia)|Lamos river]]. They were set by [[Zeus]] to guard the infant [[Dionysos]], protecting him from the machinations of [[Hera]], but the enraged goddess transformed them into ox-horned Centaurs. The Lamian Pheres later accompanied Dionysos in his campaign against the Indians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/PheresLamioi.html|title=LAMIAN PHERES - Centaurs of Dionysus in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref>\n\nCentaurs subsequently featured in [[Roman mythology]], and were familiar figures in the medieval bestiary.  They remain a staple of modern fantastic literature.  The centaur's half-human, half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as [[liminal being]]s, caught between the two natures, embodied in contrasted myths, both as the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the [[Lapith]]s (their kin), or conversely as teachers, like [[Chiron]].\n\n===Centauromachy===\n[[File:Centauromachy Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2640.jpg|thumb|Centauromachy, tondo of an [[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], ca. 480 BC]]\nThe Centaurs are best known for their fight with the [[Lapith]]s, which was caused by their attempt to carry off [[Hippodamia (wife of Pirithous)|Hippodamia]] and the rest of the Lapith women on the day of Hippodamia's marriage to [[Pirithous]], king of the Lapithae, himself the son of Ixion. The strife among these cousins is a metaphor for the conflict between the lower appetites and civilized behavior in humankind. [[Theseus]], a hero and founder of cities, who happened to be present, threw the balance in favour of the right order of things, and assisted Pirithous. The Centaurs were driven off or destroyed.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus,'' 30.</ref><ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xii. 210.</ref><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]]iv. pp. 69-70.</ref> Another Lapith hero, [[Caeneus]], who was invulnerable to weapons, was beaten into the earth by Centaurs wielding rocks and the branches of trees. Centaurs are thought of in many Greek myths as being as wild as untamed horses. Like the [[Titanomachy]], the defeat of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], the contests with the Centaurs typify the struggle between civilization and barbarism.\n\nThe Centauromachy is most famously portrayed in the [[Parthenon]] [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] by [[Phidias]] and in a Renaissance-era sculpture by [[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo]].\n\n==Other depictions in classical art==\n[[File:Cantharus Stathatou Louvre CA1987.jpg|left|thumb|[[Boeotia]]n ''[[kantharos]]'', [[Geometric art|Late Geometric period]]]]\nThe tentative identification of two fragmentary Mycenaean terracotta figures as centaurs,  among the extensive Mycenaean pottery found at [[Ugarit]], suggests a [[Bronze Age]] origin for these creatures of myth.<ref>Ione Mylonas Shear, \"Mycenaean Centaurs at Ugarit\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (2002:147\u2013153); but see the interpretation relating them to \"abbreviated group\" figures at the [[Temple of Aphaea|Bronze-Age sanctuary of Aphaia]] and elsewhere, presented by Korinna Pilafidis-Williams, \"No Mycenaean Centaurs Yet\", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''124''' (2004), p. 165, which concludes \"we had perhaps do best not to raise hopes of a continuity of images across the divide between the Bronze Age and the historical period.\"</ref> A painted terracotta centaur was found in the \"Hero's tomb\" at [[Lefkandi]], and by the Geometric period, centaurs figure among the first representational figures painted on Greek pottery. An often-published [[Geometric art|Geometric period]] bronze of a warrior face-to-face with a centaur is at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.190.2072 Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece#Art|Archaic period]], centaurs are depicted in three different forms.  Some centaurs are depicted with a human torso attached to the body of a horse at the [[withers]], where the horse's neck would be; this form, designated \"Class A\" by Professor Baur, later became standard.  \"Class B\" centaurs are depicted with a human body and legs, joined at the waist with the hindquarters of a horse; in some cases centaurs of both types appear together.  A third type, designated \"Class C\", depicts centaurs with human forelegs terminating in hooves.  Baur describes this as an apparent development of [[Aeolis|Aeolic]] art, which never became particularly widespread.<ref>Paul V. C. Baur, ''Centaurs in Ancient Art: The Archaic Period'', Karl Curtius, Berlin (1912), pp. 5\u20137.</ref>  At a later period, paintings on some [[amphoras]] depict winged centaurs.\n\nCentaurs were also frequently depicted in Roman art.  A particularly famous example is the pair of centaurs drawing the chariot of [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] and his family, in the Great Cameo of Constantine (''circa'' AD 314\u201316), which embodies wholly pagan imagery, and contrasts sharply with the popular image of Constantine as the patron of early Christianity.<ref>The Great Cameo of Constantine, formerly in the collection of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and now in the Geld en Bankmuseum, Utrecht, is illustrated, for instance, in Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:fig. 53.</ref><ref>Iain Ferris, ''The Arch of Constantine: Inspired by the Divine'', Amberley Publishing (2009).</ref>\n\n==Theories of origin==\n[[File:Achilleus Lyra.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Chiron]] teaching [[Achilles]] how to play the [[lyre]], a Roman fresco from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD.]]\nThe most common theory holds that the idea of centaurs came from the first reaction of a non-riding culture, as in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean world]], to nomads who were mounted on horses. The theory suggests that such riders would appear as half-man, half-animal ([[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] reported that the [[Aztec]]s had this misapprehension about Spanish cavalrymen).<ref>Stuart Chase, ''Mexico: A Study of Two Americas'', Chapter IV ([http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/chase/ch04.html University of Virginia Hypertext]). Retrieved 24 April 2006.</ref> [[Domestication of the horse|Horse taming and horseback culture]] arose first in the southern [[steppe]] grasslands of [[Central Asia]], perhaps approximately in modern [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nThe Lapith tribe of Thessaly, who were the kinsmen of the Centaurs in myth, were described as the inventors of horse-back riding by Greek writers. The Thessalian tribes also claimed their horse breeds were descended from the centaurs.\n\n[[File:Centaur nymph Marqueste Tuileries.jpg|thumb|Centaur carrying off a [[nymph]] (1892) by [[Laurent Marqueste]] ([[Tuileries Garden]], Paris)]]\nOf the various Classical Greek authors who mentioned centaurs, [[Pindar]] was the first who describes undoubtedly a combined monster.<ref>\"...that strange race was born, like to both parents, their mother\u2019s form below, above their sire\u2019s.\" (''Second Pythian Ode'').</ref> Previous authors ([[Homer]]) tend to use words such as ''pheres'' (cf. ''theres'', \"beasts\")<ref>For example, Homer ''Iliad'' i. 268, ii. 743.

He states that at the age of three years horses are in the prime of their life while, at three humans are still little more than babies, making hybrid animals impossible.<ref>Lucretius, ''On the Nature of Things'', book V, translated by William Ellery Leonard, 1916 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Lucr.+5.878 The Perseus Project].)

Though outside the limits of the [[Roman Empire]], these depictions appear to be derived from Classical prototypes.\n\nJerome's version of the ''Life'' of St [[Anthony the Great]], the hermit monk of Egypt, written by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages; it relates Anthony's encounter with a centaur, who challenged the saint but was forced to admit that the old gods had been overthrown.

The full-mount skeleton of a Centaur, built by Skulls Unlimited International, is on display, along with several other fabled creatures, including the [[Cyclops]], [[Unicorn]] and Griffin.\n\n[[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series depicts centaurs as the wisest and noblest of creatures. [[Narnian Centaurs]] are gifted at stargazing, prophecy, healing, and warfare, a fierce and valiant race always faithful to the High King [[Aslan]] the Lion. Lewis generally used the species to inspire awe in his readers.\n\nIn [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, centaurs live in the Forbidden Forest close to Hogwarts, preferring to avoid contact with humans.  They live in societies called herds and are skilled at archery, healing and astrology, but like in the original myths, they are known to have some wild and barbarous tendencies. Although film depictions include very animalistic facial features, the reaction of the Hogwarts girls to Firenze suggests a more classical appearance.\n\nWith the exception of [[Chiron]], the centaurs in [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' are seen as wild party-goers who use a lot of American slang. Chiron retains his mythological role as a trainer of heroes and is skilled in archery. In Riordan's subsequent series, ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'', another group of centaurs are depicted with more animalistic features (such as horns) and appear as villains, serving the [[Gigantes]].\n\n[[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series (1965) includes centaurs, called Half-Horses or Hoi Kentauroi. His creations address several of the metabolic problems of such creatures\u2014how could the human mouth and nose intake sufficient air to sustain both itself and the horse body and, similarly, how could the human ingest sufficient food to sustain both parts.\n\n[[Brandon Mull]]'s ''[[Fablehaven]]'' series features centaurs that live in an area called Grunhold. The centaurs are portrayed as a proud, elitist group of beings that consider themselves superior to all other creatures. The fourth book also has a variation on the species called an Alcetaur, which is part man, part moose.\n\nThe myth of the centaur appears in [[John Updike]]'s novel ''[[The Centaur]]''. The author depicts a rural Pennsylvanian town as seen through the optics of the myth of the centaur. An unknown and marginalized local school teacher, just like the mythological Chiron did for Prometheus, gave up his life for the future of his son who had chosen to be an independent artist in New York.\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT LIST TRIVIA HERE; info added to this section should be in essay form; list trivia at the MAIN ARTICLE: CENTAURS IN POPULAR CULTURE-->\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Centaur lekythos Met 51.163.jpg|[[Diosphos Painter]], [[white-ground]] [[lekythos]] (500 BC)\nFile:Sandro Botticelli 063.jpg|[[Botticelli]], ''[[Pallas Athena|Pallas]] and Centaur'' (1482\u201383)\nFile:Canova - Theseus defeats the centaur - close.jpg|[[Antonio Canova]], ''Theseus Defeats the Centaur'' (1805-1819)\nFile:Bova1860.jpg|Prince Bova fights ''Polkan'', Russian [[lubok]] (1860)\nFile:Centaure Malmaison crop.jpg|A bronze statue of a centaur, after the ''[[Furietti Centaurs]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greek mythology}}\n[[File:Sebastiano Ricci 045.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting by [[Sebastiano Ricci]], of centaurs at the marriage of [[Pirithous]], king of the [[Lapithae]]]]\n\nOther hybrid creatures appear in Greek mythology, always with some liminal connection that links Hellenic culture with archaic or non-Hellenic cultures:\n*[[Furietti Centaurs]]\n*[[Hippocamp]]\n*[[Hybrid (mythology)]]\n*[[Legendary creature]]\n*[[Lists of legendary creatures]]\n*[[Minotaur]]\n*[[Onocentaur]]\n*[[Ichthyocentaur]]\n*[[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n*[[Satyr]]\nAlso,\n*Egyptian deities, including [[Anubis]], [[Horus]] and [[Thoth]]\n*Indian [[Kinnara Kingdom|Kinnara]] which are half-horse and half-man creature.\n*Philippine [[Tikbalang]]\n*Roman [[Faun]]\n*Scottish [[Each uisge]]\n*Welsh [[Ceffyl D\u0175r]]\n*Hindu [[Kamadhenu]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-lr}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*M.

Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g., amino acids or oligo peptides) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: Chemoattractant moiety is accompanied by wide ranges, whereas chemorepellent character by narrow ranges.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nA changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.\nAltered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g., [[Escherichia coli]]) or intracellular (e.g., [[Listeria monocytogenes]]) pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.\nApart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome]], where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ '''Chemotaxis in diseases'''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n!

In 1069 local resistance in Cheshire was finally put down using draconian measures as part of the [[Harrying of the North]]. The ferocity of the campaign against the English populace was enough to end all future resistance. Examples were made of major landowners such as Earl [[Edwin of Mercia]], their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst Norman barons. William I made Cheshire a [[county palatine]] and gave [[Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester|Gerbod the Fleming]] the new title of [[Earl of Chester]]. When Gerbod returned to [[Normandy]] in about 1070, the king used his absence to declare the earldom forfeit and gave the title to [[Hugh d'Avranches]] (nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or \"wolf\"). Due to Cheshire's strategic location on [[Welsh Marches]], the Earl had complete autonomous powers to rule on behalf of the king in the county palatine. The earldom was sufficiently independent from the kingdom of England that the 13th century [[Magna Carta]] did not apply to the shire of [[Chester]], so the [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|earl]] wrote up his own [[Magna Carta of Chester|Chester Charter]] at the petition of his barons.<ref name=Hewitt>{{cite book | title=Mediaeval Cheshire: An Economic and Social History of Cheshire in the Reigns of the Three Edwards | last1=Hewitt | first1=Herbert James | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | page=9 | date=1929}}</ref>\n\n====Palatine hundreds====\n[[File:Cheshire domesday hundreds.svg|thumb|left|Hundreds of Cheshire in Domesday Book.

It included two [[hundred (division)|hundreds]], Atiscross and Exestan, that later became part of North [[Wales]]. At the time of the ''Domesday Book'', it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as [[English Maelor]] (which used to be a detached part of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]) in Wales.<ref>{{cite book | last = Davies | first = R. | title = The Age of Conquest: Wales 1063\u20131415 | year= 2000}}</ref> The area between the [[Mersey]] and [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (referred to in the Domesday Book as \"Inter Ripam et Mersam\") formed part of the returns for Cheshire.<ref>Morgan (1978). pp.269c\u2013301c,d.</ref><ref name=sylvesterp14>Sylvester (1980). p. 14.</ref> Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire,<ref name=sylvesterp14/><ref>Roffe (2000)</ref> more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the [[River Mersey]].<ref>Harris and Thacker (1987) write on page 252: {{quotation|Certainly there were links between Cheshire and south Lancashire before 1000, when [[Wulfric Spot]] held lands in both territories.

An example is the barony of Halton.<ref>Sanders, I.J. English Baronies, a Study of their Origin and Descent 1086\u20131327, Oxford, 1960, p.138, refers to the \"Lord\" of Halton being the hereditary constable of the County Palatine of Chester, but omits Halton from both his lists of English feudal baronies</ref> One of Hugh d'Avranche's barons has been identified as Robert Nicholls, Baron of Halton and Montebourg.<ref>Crosby, A. A History of Cheshire; Norman Chapter</ref>\n\n====Lands devolved to Lancashire====\nIn 1182 the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of [[Lancashire]], thus resolving any uncertainty about the county in which the land \"Inter Ripam et Mersam\" was.<ref>{{cite book | last = George | first = D. | title = Lancashire | year = 1991}}</ref> Over the years, the ten hundreds consolidated and changed names to leave just seven\u2014Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich and Wirral.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheshire ancient divisions |work=Vision of Britain website |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10193850 |accessdate=6 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Acquires Welsh-March lands====\nIn 1397 the county had lands in the [[march of Wales]] added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the \"Cheshire Guard\". As a result, the King's title was changed to \"King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester\". No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard's fall in 1399.<ref>Davies, R. R.

At the same time the [[Tintwistle Rural District]] was transferred to [[Derbyshire]].

Examples include [[Maiden Castle, Cheshire|Maiden Castle]] on [[Bickerton Hill]], [[Helsby]] Hillfort and Woodhouse Hillfort at [[Frodsham]]. The Roman fortress and walls of [[Chester]], perhaps the earliest building works in Cheshire remaining above ground, are constructed from purple-grey sandstone.<ref name=\"IOE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/ |title=Images of England |publisher=Images of England |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe distinctive local red sandstone has been used for many monumental and ecclesiastical buildings throughout the county: for example, the medieval [[Beeston Castle]], [[Chester Cathedral]] and numerous parish churches. Occasional residential and industrial buildings, such as [[Helsby railway station]] (1849),<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1261746|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> are also in this sandstone.\n\nMany surviving buildings from the 15th to 17th centuries are timbered, particularly in the southern part of the county. Notable examples include the moated manor house [[Little Moreton Hall]], dating from around 1450, and many commercial and residential buildings in Chester, [[Nantwich]] and surrounding villages.\n\nEarly brick buildings include [[Peover Hall]] near [[Macclesfield]] (1585), [[Tattenhall Hall]] (pre-1622), and the [[Pied Bull Hotel]] in Chester (17th century). From the 18th century, orange, red or brown brick became the predominant building material used in Cheshire, although earlier buildings are often faced or dressed with stone. Examples from the Victorian period onwards often employ distinctive brick detailing, such as brick patterning and ornate chimney stacks and gables. Notable examples include [[Arley Hall]] near [[Northwich]], [[Willington Hall]]<ref>{{IoE|55781|accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> near Chester (both by Nantwich architect [[George Latham (architect)|George Latham]]) and [[Overleigh Lodge]], Chester. From the Victorian era, brick buildings often incorporate timberwork in a mock Tudor style, and this hybrid style has been used in some modern residential developments in the county. Industrial buildings, such as the Macclesfield silk mills (for example, [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=390900 Waters Green New Mill]), are also usually in brick.\n\n==Geography==\n===Physical===\n\n{{Main article|Geology of Cheshire}}\n\nCheshire covers a [[boulder clay]] plain separating the hills of [[North Wales]] and the [[Peak District]] (the area is also known as the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire Gap]]). This was formed following the retreat of [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] glaciers which left the area dotted with [[kettle hole]]s, locally referred to as meres. The bedrock of this region is almost entirely [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]], outcrops of which have long been quarried, notably at [[Runcorn]], providing the distinctive red stone for [[Liverpool Cathedral]] and [[Chester Cathedral]].\n\nThe eastern half of the county is Upper Triassic [[Mercia Mudstone Group|Mercia Mudstone]] laid down with large [[table salt|salt]] deposits which were mined for hundreds of years around [[Winsford]].

This means that although there is no county-wide elected local council, Cheshire has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff of Cheshire|High Sheriff]] for ceremonial purposes under the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]].\n\nLocal government functions apart from the Police and Fire/Rescue services are carried out by four smaller unitary authorities: [[Cheshire East]], [[Cheshire West and Chester]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], and [[Warrington]]. All four unitary authority areas have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]].\n\nPolicing and fire and rescue services are still provided across the County as a whole. The [[Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service|Cheshire Fire Authority]] consist of members of the four councils, while governance of [[Cheshire Constabulary]] is performer by the elected [[Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner]].\n\n===Transition from the previous (1974) arrangement===\nFrom 1 April 1974 the area under the control of the county council was divided into eight local government districts; [[Chester (district)|Chester]], [[Congleton (borough)|Congleton]], [[Crewe and Nantwich]], [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], [[Macclesfield (borough)|Macclesfield]], [[Vale Royal]] and [[Warrington]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10032957 Vision of Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506230350/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10032957 |date=6 May 2007 }} \u2013 Divisions of Cheshire</ref><ref>[http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/Council/districtcouncils.htm Cheshire County Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005172200/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/Council/districtcouncils.htm |date=5 October 2006 }} \u2013 Map of Cheshire districts</ref> [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] (which includes the towns of [[Runcorn]] and [[Widnes]]) and [[Warrington]] became [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/><ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire | work=Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm | accessdate = 6 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203042519/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 3 February 2007}}</ref> The remaining districts and the county were abolished as part of local government restructuring on 1 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/634/contents/made|title=Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The Halton and Warrington boroughs were not affected by the 2009 restructuring.\n\nOn 25 July 2007, the Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] announced she was 'minded' to split Cheshire into two new unitary authorities, [[Cheshire West and Chester]], and [[Cheshire East]]. She confirmed she had not changed her mind on 19 December 2007 and therefore the proposal to split two-tier Cheshire into two would proceed.\n\nCheshire County Council leader Paul Findlow, who attempted High Court legal action against the proposal, claimed that splitting Cheshire would only disrupt excellent services while increasing living costs for all. A widespread sentiment that this decision was taken by the [[European Union]] long ago has often been portrayed via angered letters from Cheshire residents to local papers. On 31 January 2008 ''The Standard'', Cheshire and district's newspaper, announced that the legal action had been dropped. Members against the proposal were advised that they may be unable to persuade the court that the decision of Hazel Blears was \"manifestly absurd\".\n\nThe Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority covers the area formerly occupied by the City of Chester and the boroughs of Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal; Cheshire East now covers the area formerly occupied by the boroughs of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, and Macclesfield.

The county is famous for the production of [[Cheshire cheese]], [[Salt in Cheshire|salt]] and silk. The county has seen a number of [[Cheshire Inventions, Innovations and Firsts|inventions and firsts]] in its history.\n\nA mainly rural county, Cheshire has a high concentration of villages. Agriculture is generally based on the dairy trade, and cattle are the predominant livestock. Land use given to agriculture has fluctuated somewhat, and in 2005 totalled 1558&nbsp;km\u00b2 over 4,609 holdings.<ref>{{cite web | title = Agricultural Holdings \u2013 Land and Employment \u2013 Cheshire \u2013 2002 to 2005| work=Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf | accessdate = 3 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605061926/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref> Based on holdings by EC farm type in 2005, 8.51&nbsp;km\u00b2 was allocated to dairy farming, with another 11.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 allocated to cattle and sheep.\n\nThe chemical industry in Cheshire was founded in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, with the [[Salt in Cheshire|mining of salt]] in Middlewich and Northwich. Salt is still mined in the area by [[British Salt]]. The salt mining has led to a continued chemical industry around Northwich, with [[Brunner Mond]] based in the town. Other chemical companies, including [[Ineos]] (formerly [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]), have plants at [[Runcorn]]. The Essar Refinery (formerly  [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[Stanlow Refinery]]) is at Ellesmere Port. The oil refinery has operated since 1924 and has a capacity of 12&nbsp;million tonnes per year. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nCrewe was once the centre of the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British railway industry]], and remains a major railway junction. The [[Crewe Works|Crewe railway works]], built in 1840, employed 20,000 people at its peak, although the workforce is now less than 1,000. Crewe is also the home of [[Bentley]] cars. Also within Cheshire are manufacturing plants for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Vauxhall Motors]] in Ellesmere Port. The county also has an aircraft industry, with the [[BAE Systems]] facility at [[Woodford Aerodrome]], part of BAE System's Military Air Solutions division. The facility designed and constructed [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Avro Vulcan]] bombers and the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod]]. On the Cheshire border with [[Flintshire]] is the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] aircraft factory, more recently associated with [[Airbus]].\n\nTourism in Cheshire from within the UK and overseas continues to perform strongly.

The concept of a county town is ill-defined and unofficial. Following the establishment of [[county council]]s in 1889, the administrative headquarters of the new authorities were usually located in the county town of each county. However, this was not always the case and the idea of a \"county town\" pre-dates the establishment of these councils. For example, [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] is the county town of [[Lancashire]] but the county council is located at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].\n\nThe county town was often where the county members of Parliament were elected or where certain judicial functions were carried out, leading it to becoming established as the most important town in the county.\n\nSome county towns are no longer situated within the administrative county. For example, [[Nottingham]] is administered by a [[unitary authority]] entirely separate from the rest of [[Nottinghamshire]]. Many county towns are classified as [[city status in the United Kingdom|cities]], but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The term was also used historically in Jamaica.\n\n== UK county towns, pre-19th-century reforms==\n\n===Historic counties of England===\nThis list shows county towns prior to the [[Local Government Act 1888|reforms of 1889]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!County !!

Previously, the Canadian federal constitution could be amended by solitary act of the Canadian or British parliaments, by formal or informal agreement between the federal and provincial governments, or even simply by adoption as ordinary custom of an oral convention or unwritten tradition that was perceived to be the best way to do something. Since the act, amendments must now conform to certain specified provisions in the written portion of the Canadian constitution.\n\n==Constitution Act, 1867==\n{{Main|Constitution Act, 1867}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nThis was an Act of the British parliament, originally called the British North America Act 1867. It outlined Canada's system of government, which combines Britain's Westminster model of parliamentary government with division of sovereignty ([[Canadian federalism|federalism]]). Although it is the first of 20 [[British North America Acts]], it is still the most famous of these and is understood to be the document of [[Canadian Confederation]]. With the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, this Act was renamed ''Constitution Act, 1867''. In recent years, the 1867 document has mainly served as the basis on which the division of powers between the provinces and federal government have been analyzed.\n\n==Constitution Act, 1982==\n{{Main|Constitution Act, 1982}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nEndorsed by all provincial governments except that of Quebec (led by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]), this was the formal Act of Parliament that effected Canada's full political independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. Part V of this act established an amending formula for the Canadian constitution, the lack of which (due to more than 50 years of disagreement between the federal and provincial governments) was the only reason Canada's constitutional amendments still required approval by the British parliament after enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.\n\nThe Act was enacted as a schedule to the Canada Act 1982<!-- NOTE: Acts of the UK Parliament don't use a comma between \"Act\" and date -->, a British Act of Parliament which was introduced at the request of a joint address to the Queen by the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. As a bilingual act of parliament, the Canada Act 1982 has the distinction of being the only legislation in French that has been passed by an English or British parliament since Norman French ([[Law French]]) ceased to be the language of government in England. In addition to enacting the Constitution Act, 1982, the Canada Act 1982 provides that no further British Acts of Parliament will apply to Canada as part of its law, finalizing Canada's legislative independence.\n\n===Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms===\n{{Main|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}\nAs noted above, this is Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter is the constitutional guarantee of the civil rights and liberties of every citizen in Canada, such as freedom of expression, of religion, and of mobility. Part II addresses the rights of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]].\n\nIt is written in plain language to ensure accessibility to the average citizen. It applies only to government and government actions with the intention to prevent government from creating laws that are unconstitutional.\n\n===Amending formula===\n{{Main|Amendments to the Constitution of Canada}}\nInstead of the usual parliamentary procedure, that includes the monarch's formal [[royal assent]] for enacting legislation, amendments to the Constitution Act, 1982, must be done in accordance with Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides for five different amending formulae. Amendments can be brought forward under section 46(1) by any province or either level of the federal government. The general formula is set out in section 38(1), known as the \"7/50 formula\", and requires: (a) assent from both the House of Commons and the Senate; (b) the approval of two-thirds of the provincial legislatures (at least seven provinces) representing at least 50 per cent of the population (effectively, this would include at least Quebec or Ontario, as they are the most populous provinces). This formula specifically applies to amendments related to the proportionate representation in Parliament, powers, selection, and composition of the Senate, the Supreme Court and the addition of provinces or territories.\n\nThe other amendment formulae are for exceptional cases as provided by in the act. In the case of an amendment related to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Office of the Queen]], the use of either official language (subject to section 43), the amending formula itself, or the composition of the Supreme Court, the amendment must be adopted by unanimous consent of all the provinces in accordance with section 41. In the case of an amendment related to provincial boundaries or the use of an official language within a province alone, the amendment must be passed by the legislatures affected by the amendment (section 43). In the case of an amendment that affects the federal government only, the amendment does not need approval of the provinces (section 44).

These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between crochet and [[knitting]], beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. (Variant forms such as [[Tunisian crochet]] and [[broomstick lace]] keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.)\n\n[[File:Crochet.webm|thumb|Video demonstration of crochet technique]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word crochet is derived from the [[Old French]] ''crochet'', a diminutive of ''croche'', in turn from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ''croc'', both meaning \"hook\".<ref name=\"Crochet\"/> It was used in 17th-century French [[lace]] making, ''crochetage'' designating a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace, and ''crochet'' subsequently designating both a specific type of fabric and the hooked needle used to produce it. Although the fabric is not known to be crochet in the present sense, a genealogical relationship between the techniques sharing that name appears likely.<ref>Santina M. Levey, ''Lace: a History'', Victoria & Albert Museum, London, 1983, {{ISBN|090128615X}}, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nKnitted textiles survive from early periods, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric relates to its appearance in Europe during the 19th century.<ref>Lis Paludan, ''Crochet: History & Technique'', Interweave Press, Loveland CO, {{ISBN|1883010098}}, p. 76</ref> Earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by [[n\u00e5lebinding]], a different looped yarn technique.\n\n[[File:Illustration of a crocheted purse in the Dutch monthly publication, \"Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9\", from 1824.png|left|thumb|A crocheted purse described in 1823 in ''Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9'']]\n\nThe first known published instructions for crochet explicitly using that term to designate the craft in its present sense appeared in the Dutch magazine ''Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9'' in 1823. This includes a color plate showing five styles of purse of which three were intended to be crocheted with silk thread.<ref>[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9_of_maandwerk_aan_het_vrouwelijk_geslacht?id=PtFeAAAAcAAJ] A.

The second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (''demi jour''), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with \"double-crochet stitches\" (''dubbelde hekelsteek'': double-crochet in British terminology; single-crochet in US).<ref>Sarah Hazell, ''200 Crochet Stitches'', Search Press, Kent, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-84448-963-3}}</ref> The third purse is made entirely in double-crochet. The instructions prescribe the use of a tambour needle (as illustrated below) and introduce a number of decorative techniques.\n\nThe earliest dated English reference to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook\u2014''shepherd's knitting''\u2014is in ''The Memoirs of a Highland Lady'' by Elizabeth Grant (1797\u20131830). The journal entry, itself, is dated 1812 but was not recorded in its subsequently published form until some time between 1845 and 1867, and the actual date of publication was first in 1898.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofhighlan00graniala#page/182/] Elizabeth Grant, ''The Memoirs of a Highland Lady'', John Murray, London, 1898 p. 182.</ref> Nonetheless, the 1833 volume of ''Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9'' describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951002797142b;view=1up;seq=176] A. B. Van Meerten, ''Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9, of, Maandwerk aan het vrouwelijk geslacht toegewijd'', Amsterdam, 1833, pp. 152</ref>\n\nIn 1842, one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states:\n::\"Crochet needles, sometimes called ''Shepherds' hooks'', are made of steel, ivory, or box-wood. They have a hook at one end similar in shape to a fish-hook, by which the wool or silk is caught and drawn through the work. These instruments are to be procured of various sizes...\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/handbookofneedle00lamb#page/92/] Miss Lambert, ''Hand-book of Needlework'', New York City, 1842, p.92</ref>\n\nTwo years later, the same author, writes:\n::\"Crochet, \u2014 a species of knitting originally practised by the peasants in Scotland, with a small hooked needle called a shepherd\u2019s hook, \u2014 has, within the last seven years, aided by taste and fashion, obtained the preference over all other ornamental works of a similar nature. It derives its present name from the French; the instrument with which it is worked being by them, from its crooked shape, termed 'crochet.' This art has attained its highest degree of perfection in England, whence it has been transplanted to France and Germany, and both countries, although unjustifiably, have claimed the invention.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/mycrochetsample00lambgoog#page/13/] Miss Lambert, ''My Crochet Sampler'', London, 1844, pp. 9-10</ref>\n\nAn instruction book from 1846 describes ''Shepherd or Single Crochet'' as what in current British usage is either called single crochet or slip-stitch crochet, with U.S. American terminology always using the latter (reserving single crochet for use as noted above).<ref>Nancy Nehring, ''Learn Slip Stitch Crochet'', Annie's Attic, Berne IN, 2008, {{ISBN|1596352159}}, p. 2</ref> It similarly equates \"Double\" and \"French crochet\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/knittingcrochet00brangoog#page82] Mlle. Riego de la Branchardiere, ''Knitting, Crochet, and Netting'', London, 1846, p.57</ref>\n\n[[File:Encyclopedie volume 2-140.png|right|thumb|Tambour embroidery in the Diderot Encyclopedia]]\nNotwithstanding the categorical assertion of a purely British origin, there is solid evidence of a connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former method of production was illustrated in detail in 1763 in [[Encyclop\u00e9die|Diderot's Encyclopedia]]. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 ''Pen\u00e9lop\u00e9'' instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms ''tambour'' and ''crochet'' as synonyms.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TheLadysAssistantForExecutingUsefulAndFancyDesignsInKnitting/gaugain_lady_01#page/n8/] Mrs. Gaugain, ''The Lady's Assistant for Executing Useful and Fancy Designs in Knitting, Netting and Crotchet Work'', Edinburgh, 1840</ref> This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ladysassistantfo01gaug] [[Jane Gaugain]], ''The Lady's Assistant for Executing Useful and Fancy Designs in Knitting, Netting and Crochet Work'', 4th ed., 1847</ref>\n\n[[File:Tapered-hooks.png|thumb|left|100px|Shepherd's hook, 19th-century tapered hook, modern inline hook]]\nThe strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time. Early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops. The design with a cylindrical shaft that is commonplace today was largely reserved for tambour-style steel needles. Both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared toward the end of the 19th century, including both tapered and cylindrical segments, and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until World War II.\n\nThe early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of 'ivory, bone, or wooden hooks' and 'steel needles in a handle', as appropriate to the stitch being made. Taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd's- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of French- and double crochet, there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd's knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made. The locus of the fusion of all these elements\u2014the \"invention\" noted above\u2014has yet to be determined, as does the origin of shepherd's knitting.\n\nShepherd's hooks are still being made for local slip-stitch crochet traditions. The form in the accompanying photograph is typical for contemporary production. A longer continuously tapering design intermediate between it and the 19th-century tapered hook was also in earlier production, commonly being made from the handles of forks and spoons.\n\n==Irish crochet==\n[[File:Table-cloth 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Detail of a Portuguese crochet table-cloth, about 1970]]\n[[Image:Irish crochet.jpg|thumb|[[Irish crochet]] lace, late 19th century.

Crocheted laces in the new Edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.\n\n[[File:AnselAdamscrochet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Filet crochet]] by an internee at [[Manzanar]] War Relocation Center, 1943.  Photograph by [[Ansel Adams]]]]\nThe strong Victorian colours disappeared, though, and new publications called for white or pale threads, except for fancy purses, which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I, far fewer crochet patterns were published, and most of them were simplified versions of the early 20th-century patterns. After [[World War II]], from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the United States, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included wonderful variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.\n[[File:Gold_Short_Jacket_by_Sybil_Connolly_-_Button_Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail on gold thread crochet in a mid-20th century short jacket designed by [[Sybil Connolly]]]]  \nAlthough crochet underwent a subsequent decline in popularity, the early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and [[Do it yourself|DIY]], as well as great strides in improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. There are many more new pattern books with modern patterns being printed, and most yarn stores now offer crochet lessons in addition to the traditional knitting lessons. There are many books you can purchase from local book stores to teach yourself how to crochet whether it be as a beginner or intermediate.  There are also many books for children and teenagers who are hoping to take up the hobby. \n[[Filet crochet]], Tunisian crochet, [[tapestry crochet]], broomstick lace, [[hairpin lace]], [[cro-hook]]ing, and Irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method.\n\n[[File:TapestryCrochetGuatemala.jpg|thumb|left|Bags and [[hacky sack]] [[tapestry crochet]]ed in Guatemala.]]\n\nCrochet has experienced a revival on the catwalk as well.  [[Christopher Kane]]'s Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection<ref>[http://artipack.fr/13-nos-sacs-en-toile Fashion and shopping]</ref> makes intensive use of the [[granny square]], one of the most basic of crochet motifs.  In addition, crochet has been utilized many times by designers on the popular reality show ''[[Project Runway]]''. Websites such as [[Etsy]] and [[Ravelry]] have made it easier for individual hobbyists to sell and distribute their patterns or projects across the internet.\n\nLaneya Wiles released a music video titled \"Straight Hookin'\" which makes a play on the word \"[[hookers]],\" which has a double meaning for both \"one who crochets\" and \"a prostitute.\"\n\n==Materials==\nBasic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread.  Yarn, one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring crocheted fabric, or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make [[tassels]], [[fringe (trim)|fringe]], and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a [[tape measure]] and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a [[row counter (hand knitting)|row counter]]; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.\nIn recent years, yarn selections have moved beyond synthetic and plant and animal-based fibers to include bamboo, qiviut, hemp, and banana stalks, to name a few.\n\n===Crochet hook===\n[[Image:Crohook.jpg|thumb|upright|Aluminium crochet hooks]]\n{{Main|Crochet hook}}\nThe crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel. Because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook's shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. If gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size. Crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use. Hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.\n\nSteel crochet hooks range in size from 0.4 to 3.5 millimeters, or from 00 to 16 in American sizing. These hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace.\n\nAluminium, bamboo, and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2.5 to 19 millimeters in size, or from B to S in American sizing.\n\nArtisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.\n\nCrochet hooks used for Tunisian crochet are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle, while double-ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle. There is also a double hooked apparatus called a [[Cro-hook]] that has become popular.\n\nA hairpin loom is often used to create lacy and long stitches, known as hairpin lace. While this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.\n\nSee : [[List of United States standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes]]\n\n===Yarn===\n\n{{main|Yarn}}\n[[Image:Yarn hank uncoiled.png|thumb|A hank of wool yarn (center) is uncoiled into its basic loop. A tie is visible at the left; after untying, the hank may be wound into a ball or balls suitable for crocheting. Crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn, producing snarls.]]\n\nYarn for crochet is usually sold as balls or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones.  Skeins and balls are generally sold with a ''yarn band'', a label that describes the yarn's [[YarnWeight|weight]], length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc.  It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased.  Crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot.  The dye lot specifies a group of skeins that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when added onto existing work.  If insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.\n\nThe thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. This is also termed the gauge. Thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks.  Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project. The recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores. Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate pattern-work.  Yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky. Quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI).  The related ''weight per unit length''  is usually measured in [[Units of textile measurement|tex or denier]].\n\n[[Image:Yarn hank and ball.png|thumb|left|Transformation of a hank of lavender silk yarn (top) into a ball in which the yarn emerges from the center (bottom). Using the latter is better for needlework, since the yarn is much less likely to tangle.]]\n\nBefore use, hanks are wound into balls in which the yarn emerges from the center, making crocheting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. The winding process may be performed by hand or done with a ballwinder and [[Swift (textiles)|swift]].\n\nA yarn's usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its ''loft'' (its ability to trap air), its ''resilience'' (elasticity under tension), its [[laundry|washability]] and colorfastness, its ''hand'' (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to [[pill (textile)|pilling]], its ''hairiness'' (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and [[Felt#Wet felting|felting]] qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.  Other factors include allergenicity, speed of drying, resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew, melting point and flammability, retention of static electricity, and the propensity to accept dyes.  Desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one \"best\" yarn.\n[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.png|thumb|upright|right|The two possible twists of yarn]]\n\nAlthough crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] fibers.  In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn.  If the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward draw, the yarn is smoother and called a ''worsted''; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward draw, the yarn is fuzzier and called ''woolen-spun''.  The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous ''filament'' fibers such as [[silk]] and many synthetics, or they may be ''[[staple (wool)|staples]]'' (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning.  The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn.  In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called ''worst''), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension.  The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a ''slub'' is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.\n\nThe spun fibers are generally divided into [[animal fiber]]s, plant and [[synthetic fiber]]s.  These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and synthetic [[polymer]]s, respectively.  Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of animals such as [[sheep]] ([[wool]]), [[goat]] ([[angora goat|angora]], or [[cashmere goat]]), [[rabbit]] ([[angora rabbit|angora]]), [[llama]], [[alpaca]], [[dog]], [[cat]], [[camel]], [[yak]], and [[muskox]] ([[qiviut]]).  Plants used for fibers include [[cotton]], [[flax]] (for [[linen]]), [[bamboo]], [[ramie]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[raffia]], [[yucca]], [[coconut]] husk, [[banana tree]]s, [[soy]] and [[Maize|corn]].  [[Rayon]] and [[cellulose acetate|acetate]] fibers are also produced from [[cellulose]] mainly derived from [[tree]]s.  Common synthetic fibers include [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]]s,<ref>{{cite book | last = Masson | first = James | title = Acrylic Fiber Technology and Applications | publisher = Marcel Dekker, Inc. | year = 1995 | location = New York \t| page = 172 | isbn = 0-8247-8977-6 }}</ref> [[polyester]]s such as [[polyethylene terephthalate|dacron]] and [[ingeo]], [[nylon]] and other polyamides, and [[olefin]]s such as [[polypropylene]].  Of these types, wool is generally favored for crochet, chiefly owing to its superior [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], warmth and (sometimes) [[felt]]ing; however, wool is generally less convenient to [[laundry|clean]] and some people are allergic to it.  It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk.  Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, [[Merino]] wool and [[Gossypium barbadense|Egyptian cotton]] are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.\n\nA single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or [[braid]]ed or [[plying|plied]] with another.  In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist.  The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, ''balanced'' yarn.  Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing ''cabled yarns'' or ''multi-stranded yarns''.  Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in [[boucl\u00e9]].  The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.\n\nThe dyeing of yarns is a complex art.  Yarns need not be dyed; or they may be dyed one color, or a great variety of colors.  Dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn.  A great variety of synthetic dyes have been developed since the synthesis of [[indigo dye]] in the mid-19th century; however, [[natural dye]]s are also possible, although they are generally less brilliant.  The color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its [[colorway]].  Variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Mohair lace crocheted scarf detailed photo.jpeg|thumb|A close view of a crocheted scarf made with lace-weight mohair yarn.]]\nCrocheted fabric is begun by placing a [[Slip knot|slip-knot]] loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length. The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain. At any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time.  Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat (back and forth in rows) or in the round (in spirals, such as when making tubular pieces).\n\n==Types of stitches==\nThere are five main types of basic stitches (the following description uses US crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the UK and Europe).\n# Chain Stitch \u2013 the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects.\n# Slip Stitch \u2013 used to join chain stitch to form a ring.\n# Single Crochet Stitch (called Double Crochet Stitch in the UK) \u2013 easiest stitch to master [http://crochet.about.com/od/learntocrochet/ss/Single_Crochet.htm Single Crochet Stitch Tutorial]\n# Half Double Crochet Stitch (called Half Treble Stitch in the UK) \u2013 the 'in-between' stitch [http://crochet.about.com/od/learntocrochet/tp/half-double-crochet-stitch.htm Half-Double Crochet Tutorial]\n# Double Crochet Stitch (called Treble Stitch in the UK) \u2013 many uses for this unlimited use stitch  [http://crochet.about.com/od/learntocrochet/ss/DoubleCrochet.htm Double Crochet Stitch Tutorial]\n\nWhile the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.\n\nThe more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations. More advanced stitches include the Shell Stitch, V Stitch, Spike Stitch, Afghan Stitch, Butterfly Stitch, Popcorn Stitch, Cluster stitch, and Crocodile Stitch.\n\n==International crochet terms and notations==\n{{Main|List of crochet stitches}}\n[[File:Crochet symbols.gif|left|thumb|Some crochet symbols, abbreviations, and US/UK terms]]\nIn the English-speaking crochet world, [[List of crochet stitches|basic stitches]] have different names that vary by country. The differences are usually referred to as UK/US or British/American.  Crochet is traditionally worked off a written pattern in which stitches and placement are communicated using textual abbreviations<ref>{{cite web |title=Crochet Abbreviations Master List |url=https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/crochet-abbreviations |website=Craft Yarn Council |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>. To help counter confusion when reading patterns, a diagramming system using a standard international notation has come into use (illustration, left).\n\nAnother terminological difference is known as ''tension'' (UK) and ''gauge'' (US). Individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches. In order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook. North Americans call this ''gauge'', referring to the end result of these adjustments; British crocheters speak of ''tension'', which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.\n\n==Differences from and similarities to knitting==\n\nOne of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a knitted fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.\n\nRound or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles.  Many crocheted items are composed of individual [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] which are then joined together, either by sewing or crocheting, whereas knitting is usually composed of one fabric, such as [[entrelac]].\n\n[[Freeform crochet and knitting|Freeform crochet]] is a technique that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece. It is generally accomplished by building shapes or structural elements onto existing crocheted fabric at any place the crafter desires.\n\nKnitting can be accomplished by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand. The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubert|first=Margaret|title=Knit Or Crochet - Have It Your Way|year=2009|publisher=Creative Publishing International, Inc|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=978-1-58923-431-4|page=6}}</ref>\n\nWhile most crochet is made with a hook, there is also a method of crocheting with a knitting loom. This is called loomchet.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brenda GA, Dome-Dweller |url=http://loomlady.blogspot.com/2010_03_01_archive.html |title=Loom Lore: March 2010 |publisher=Loomlady.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ayarnifiedlife.wordpress.com/slip-stitch-crochet/ |title=Slip Stitch Crochet \u00ab A Yarnified Life |publisher=Ayarnifiedlife.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIt is a common perception that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less \"give\" than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items. Although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general. Most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn. Tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces. According to sources<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.crochetliberationfront.com/clf-myth-busting-13-more-yarn/ |title=Crochet does not use 1/3 more yarn than knitting |publisher=Crochetliberationfront.com |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch. Any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric. Cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.\n\nStandard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch. This is part of why they use more yarn. Slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.\n\nAny yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties should be taken into account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for [[Amigurumi]] crochet.<ref>http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/southern-belle-lulu</ref>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<gallery widths=\"225px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Differences between crochet and knitting\">\nFile:Crochet-round.jpg|Most crochet uses one hook and works upon one stitch at a time.

People have also crocheted clothing and then donated it to hospitals, for sick patients and also for newborn babies. Sometimes groups will crochet for a specific charity purpose, such as crocheting for [[homeless shelters]], [[nursing homes]], etc.\nIt is also becoming increasingly popular to crochet hats (commonly referred to as \"chemo caps\") and donate them to cancer treatment centers, for those undergoing chemotherapy. During the month of October pink hats and scarves are made and proceeds are donated to breast cancer funds. A few organizations dedicated to using crochet as a way to help others include [[Knots of Love]], Crochet for Cancer,<ref>{{cite web|title=Crochet for Cancer|url=http://www.crochetforcancer.org|website= Crochet for Cancer |accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> and Soldiers' Angels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soldiers' Angels-Sewing and Crafting Team|url=http://soldiersangels.org/Sewing-and-Crafting-Team.html|website=Soldiers' Angels|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> These organizations offer warm useful items for people in need.\n\n==Mathematics and hyperbolic crochet==\nCrochet has been used to illustrate shapes in hyperbolic space that are difficult to reproduce using other media or are difficult to understand when viewed two-dimensionally.<ref name=\"hyperbolic\">{{cite web | date = December 21, 2006  | url = http://www.theiff.org/oexhibits/oe1e.html | title = Hyperbolic Space | work = The Institute for Figuring | accessdate = January 15, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMathematician [[Daina Taimina]] first used crochet in 1997 to create strong, durable models of hyperbolic space after finding paper models were delicate and hard to create.  These models enable one to turn, fold, and otherwise manipulate space to more fully grasp ideas such as how a line can appear curved in hyperbolic space yet actually be straight.  Her work received an exhibition by the [[Institute For Figuring]].<ref name=\"hyperbolic\" />[[Image:Crochet hyperbolic kelp.jpg|thumb|A collection of crocheted hyperbolic planes, in imitation of a coral reef.]]\nExamples in nature of organisms that show hyperbolic structures include lettuces, sea slugs, flatworms and coral.

Two such shows include [http://crochetcoralreef.org/exhibitions/smithsonian.php Sant Ocean Hall] at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] in Washington D.C. and [https://web.archive.org/web/20130911233042/http://galleries.lafayette.edu/2011/09/01/sticks-hooks-and-the-mobius-knit-and-crochet-goes-cerebral/ Sticks, Hooks, and the Mobius: Knit and Crochet Go Cerebral] at [[Lafayette College]] in Pennsylvania.\n\n==Architecture==\n\nIn ''Style in the technical arts'', Gottfried Semper looks at the textile with great promise and historical precedent. In Section 53, he writes of the \"loop stitch, or Noeud Coulant: a knot that, if untied, causes the whole system to unravel.\" In the same section, Semper confesses his ignorance of the subject of crochet but believes strongly that it is a technique of great value as a textile technique and possibly something more.\n\nThere are a small number of architects currently interested in the subject of crochet as it relates to architecture. The following publications, explorations and thesis projects can be used as a resource to see how crochet is being used within the capacity of architecture.\n*[https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/32543/ Emergent Explorations: Analog and Digital Scripting] - Alexander Worden\n*Research and Design: The Architecture of variation - Lars Spuybroek\n*[http://yurtalert.com/about/ YurtAlert] - Kate Pokorny\n\n===Yarn bombing===\n{{Main|Yarn bombing}}\nIn the past few years, a practice called [[yarn bombing]], or the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings, emerged in the US and spread worldwide.<ref name=yarnbombing>{{cite news | last = Anonymous  | title = Knitters turn to graffiti artists with 'yarnbombing' | language = | publisher = ''The Telegraph''  | date = 2009-01-21  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4305406/Knitters-turn-to-graffiti-artists-with-yarnbombing.html  | accessdate = 2009-05-25}}</ref> Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification.
